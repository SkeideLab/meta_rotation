,Search strategy,7,"Present the full search strategies for all databases, registers and websites, including any filters and limits used.",Methods: Information sources and search strategy
,Selection process,8,"Specify the methods used to decide whether a study met the inclusion criteria of the review, including how many reviewers screened each record and each report retrieved, whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process.",Methods: Selection process
,Data collection process ,9,"Specify the methods used to collect data from reports, including how many reviewers collected data from each report, whether they worked independently, any processes for obtaining or confirming data from study investigators, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process.",Methods: Data collection process and items
,Data items ,10a,"List and define all outcomes for which data were sought. Specify whether all results that were compatible with each outcome domain in each study were sought (e.g. for all measures, time points, analyses), and if not, the methods used to decide which results to collect.",Methods: Data collection process and items
,,10b,"List and define all other variables for which data were sought (e.g. participant and intervention characteristics, funding sources). Describe any assumptions made about any missing or unclear information.",Methods: Data collection process and items
,Study risk of bias assessment,11,"Specify the methods used to assess risk of bias in the included studies, including details of the tool(s) used, how many reviewers assessed each study and whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process.",Methods: Selection process
,Effect measures ,12,"Specify for each outcome the effect measure(s) (e.g. risk ratio, mean difference) used in the synthesis or presentation of results.",Methods: Effect measures
,Synthesis methods,13a,Describe the processes used to decide which studies were eligible for each synthesis (e.g. tabulating the study intervention characteristics and comparing against the planned groups for each synthesis (item #5)).,Methods: Data collection process and items

,,13f,Describe any sensitivity analyses conducted to assess robustness of the synthesized results.,Methods: Bayesian meta-analysis; Supplementary Methods 1
,Reporting bias assessment,14,Describe any methods used to assess risk of bias due to missing results in a synthesis (arising from reporting biases).,Methods: Reporting bias and certainty asssessment
,Certainty assessment,15,Describe any methods used to assess certainty (or confidence) in the body of evidence for an outcome.,Methods: Reporting bias and certainty asssessment

,,16b,"Cite studies that might appear to meet the inclusion criteria, but which were excluded, and explain why they were excluded.",Methods: Selection process
,Study characteristics ,17,Cite each included study and present its characteristics.,Supplementary Table 1
