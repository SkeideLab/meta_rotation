Neurology	https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000120549.77188.36	OBJECTIVE: To study long-term effects on neurologic, neuropsychological, and behavioral functioning in children treated for cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma  (CPA) without additional radio- and chemotherapy. METHODS: The authors assessed  speech, language, nonverbal intelligence, attention, memory, executive skills, and  visual (-spatial) functions in a consecutive series of 23 children. Neurologic and  neuropsychological follow-up ranged from 1 year to 8 years and 10 months after  resection. RESULTS: Long-term sequelae in the investigated domains were found in all  children. Apraxia, motor neglect, and dysarthric features, as well as language,  sustained attention, visual-spatial, executive, memory, and behavioral problems,  were observed in various combinations and to different degrees. No clear pattern of  neurocognitive disturbances could be discerned in this group. In addition,  significant relationships were revealed between severity of preoperative  hydrocephalus and visual-spatial skills. The high percentage of children who needed  special education reflects the severity of the impairments. CONCLUSION: Despite the  current opinion of a good quality of life after CPA treatment, careful long-term  neurocognitive follow-up is needed in order to inform parents and teachers about the  behavioral and cognitive sequelae and to contribute to timely social and educational  intervention.

Schizophrenia Research	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2012.01.035	Patients with psychosis have higher rates of childhood trauma, which is also associated with adverse effects on cognitive functions such as attention, concentration and mental speed, language, and verbal intelligence. Although the pathophysiological substrate for this association remains unclear, these cognitive deficits may represent the functional correlate of changes observed in relation to trauma exposure in structures such as the amygdala and the hippocampus. Interestingly, these structures are often reported as altered in psychosis. This study investigated the association between childhood trauma, cognitive function and amygdala and hippocampus volume, in first-episode psychosis. We investigated 83 patients with first-episode psychosis and 63 healthy controls. All participants underwent an MRI scan acquired with a GE Sigma 1.5-T system, and a standardized neuropsychological assessment of general cognition, memory, processing speed, executive function, visuo-spatial abilities, verbal intelligence, and language. In a subsample of the patients (N. =. 45) information on childhood trauma was collected with the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire (CECA.Q). We found that amygdala, but not hippocampus, volume was significantly smaller (p. =. 0.001) in patients compared to healthy controls. There was a trend level interaction for hippocampus volume between group and sex (p. =. 0.056). A history of childhood trauma was associated with both worse cognitive performance and smaller amygdala volume. This smaller amygdala appeared to mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and performance on executive function, language and verbal intelligence in patients with psychosis. This points to a complex relationship between childhood trauma exposure, cognitive function and amygdala volume in first-episode psychosis. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

While several studies have examined the influence of spatial activities on the development of spatial skills (e.g., Nazareth et al., 2013) there currently exists no widely used comprehensive measure to assess children’s concurrent participation in spatial activities and engagement with spatial toys. Study 1 of the current dissertation filled this gap in the field of spatial research through the creation of the Spatial Activity Questionnaire, a comprehensive survey designed to assess children’s involvement in spatial activities and engagement with spatial toys of diverse gender-typed content. The toys and activities 295 children were reported to have access to and engage with were explored to assess patterns of play with spatial and gender-stereotyped toys and activities. A sample of 76 children between 4 and 6 years of age and their primary caregivers participated in studies 2, 3, and 4 to explore the toys and activities young children have access to and play with (study 2), the link between play and mental rotation (study 3), and the relation between play, gender stereotypes, and mental rotation skills (study 4). Findings reveal great variability in the toys and activities children have access to and play with, with sex difference suggesting girls play with low-spatial and stereotypically feminine toys and activities more than boys while boys play with highly-spatial and stereotypically masculine toys and activities more than girls. Adding to the exiting literature suggesting the inconsistency of sex differences in early mental rotation skills, our results suggest no sex differences in children’s mental rotation ability. Furthermore, no relations were discovered between children’s play, gender stereotypes, and mental rotation ability. These findings point to the need to further explore the influence of play on when and how sex differences in mental rotation ability develop in order to promote fun and easy ways to support spatial learning in young boys and girls.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02563	The current study explores change in mental rotation skills throughout the pre-kindergarten year in a Hispanic population to better understand the development  of early sex differences in mental rotation. Ninety-six Hispanic children (M = 4  years 8 months) completed a mental rotation task at the beginning and end of  pre-kindergarten. Results suggest Hispanic boys and girls differed in gains on  mental rotation ability, with boys improving significantly more than girls during  pre-kindergarten on a mental rotation task. This study highlights the significance  of studying mental rotation abilities in a Hispanic population of pre-kindergarten  aged children and suggests the importance of examining sex differences in mental  rotation over time, rather than at one time-point, to better understand when sex  differences in spatial skills develop. We discuss various factors that potentially  affect the growth of spatial skills including the role of early education, spatial  experiences, and spatial language input.

To better understand the neuropsychology of IGE, more research is needed on syndromes other than JME, controlling potential confounding factors as the cognitive effects of valproate and epileptic discharges (ED). We describe the neuropsychological profile of a group of patients with different syndromes of IGE including simultaneous video electroencephalography (EEG). Methods: We performed a comprehensive cognitive and neuropsychiatric evaluation with video-EEG on 61 adults with IGE (JME 19; IGE with generalized tonic–clonic seizures [GTCS] alone [IGE-GTCS] 22; childhood absence epilepsy [CAE] or juvenile absences epilepsy [JAE] persisting in adulthood 20). We compared results between patients (globally and by syndrome) and a control group of 21 individuals (similar age, educational level); p-values were adjusted for multiple testing according to a 0.05 false discovery rate. Results: Patients obtained significantly lower results than controls on visuospatial working memory, processing speed, cognitive flexibility and strategy, abstract visuospatial reasoning, arithmetic, and acquired knowledge. While CAE/JAE showed the lowest scores on cognitive assessment and highest anxiety index, IGE-GTCS showed the most favorable scores. Most tests were not influenced by valproate intake, and the dose did not correlate with cognitive performance in the test that yielded differences between patients and controls. Epileptic discharges during assessment were not frequent (10 patients, 1–4 tests). Significance: Our findings suggest that patients with IGE have significantly lower abilities in various executive functions and acquired knowledge, compared to population of same age and education. The low frequency of ED on simultaneous video-EEG and absence of correlation of scores with valproate dose reinforce that the obtained results are due to a cognitive phenotype in IGE. This phenotype may be influenced by syndrome, and patients with CAE/JAE persisting in the adult may have a wider neuropsychiatric impairment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

There are, however, considerable differences between children, and it is not completely understood what these individual differences are due to. We studied how children at 4 years of age employ speech and iconic gestures to convey meaning in different kinds of spatial event descriptions, and how this relates to their cognitive abilities. Focusing on spontaneous illustrations of actions, we applied a semantic feature (SF) analysis to characterize combinations of speech and gesture meaning and related them to the child's visual-spatial abilities or abstract/concrete reasoning abilities (measured using the standardized SON-R (Formula presented.) test). Results show that children with higher cognitive abilities convey significantly more meaning via gesture and less solely via speech. These findings suggest that young children's use of cospeech representational gesturing is positively related to their mental representation and reasoning abilities. © 2021 The Authors.

Maintaining a physically active lifestyle is recommended, but finding appropriate exercises that cater to their needs can be difficult. As a result, the pilot fitness program Move4Fun/Move4Fitness was developed. This 12-week basic fitness program teaches young survivors of cancer appropriate exercises and how they can exercise on their own with limited space and equipment. Participants experienced physical and mental transformations demonstrated through weight loss, building of muscle, and increased self-confidence. © 2017 by the Oncology Nursing Society (ONS).

On the test trial, normal access was blocked and infants were either guided by their mother or allowed to move on their own to another opening on the opposite side. In Experiment 1 significantly more correct responding occurred after active movement than after passive at 12 months, with correct responding related to high visual tracking. In contrast, at 18 months correct search without tracking predominated among both movement conditions. A difference between the conditions in the position of the mother on the test trial was ruled out as a contributor to performance on the basis of data from Experiment 2. When opaque sides were inserted to prevent tracking in Experiment 3, active movement no longer facilitated correct search at 12 months, thus indicating that the tracking and not the active movement per se was the critical factor.

Human movement science	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humov.2017.08.021	Children with impaired motor coordination (or Development Coordination Disorder - DCD) have difficulty with the predictive control of movements, evidenced by  cross-sectional studies that show impaired motor imagery and action planning  abilities. What remains unclear is whether this deficit in predictive control  reflects immaturity of the motor system (a developmental delay) or some deviation  from normal development (a disorder). To advance this discussion the present study  used a longitudinal design to examine the development of motor imagery and action  planning in children with DCD. Thirty children were included in the DCD group (aged  6-11years) and age- and gender-matched to 30 controls. The DCD group had a mABC-2  score≤16th percentile, the control group>20th percentile. Motor imagery was assessed  with the hand rotation task, action planning with a test for end-state comfort.  Children participated in three measurements, with one year in between measurements.  Results showed that children with DCD were slower and less accurate than their  typically developing peers in all subsequent years but were able to improve their  motor imagery ability over time. Furthermore, children with DCD showed less planning  for ESC at the start of the present study, but were able to catch up with their  peers during two-year follow up. These results exemplify that improvement of motor  imagery and action planning ability is possible in DCD, and they lend theoretical  support to the use of new training techniques that focus on training motor imagery  to improve motor skills in children with DCD.

Research also shows that a relationship exists between spatial ability and mathematics achievement. Because of this, education groups and researchers realize the importance of spatial competence and are recommending that developing sound spatial skills should be a focus in math curriculum. In addition, a spotlight on using focused interventions and technology to enhance spatial ability has arisen.    Students in this study used software called LEGO Digital Designer 2.3® to build with blocks in a virtual world. This study focused on block play through technology and used a newly created Digital Complexity Scale based on established block stages and scales to evaluate kindergarten students' digital block designs. Using the Kruskall-Wallis test, this study found no significant differences in complexity between male and female's digital block constructions.

Journal of safety research	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2005.07.005	INTRODUCTION: At some point during their illness, drivers with dementia pose a public safety risk. METHOD: To address the issue of determining driving competence  in drivers with dementia, the authors reviewed 11 studies. RESULTS: When comparing  different driving assessments, the authors found that while road tests, simulators,  and neuropsychological tests are important, each has limitations. CONCLUSION:  Neuropsychological tests that highlighted visual spatial skills, attention, and  reaction time provided the most meaningful correlations with driving performance.  Furthermore, the authors recommend that patients with MMSE scores of 24 or less have  a driving evaluation, and that driving evaluations be repeated at six month  intervals or more frequently if a noticeable decline is observed. IMPACT: Because  many older adults with dementia continue to drive, competence must be addressed.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	2	2	0	0	1

Participants: Thirty-one children with RSTS 1 (mean chronological age, CA = 59,8 months; 33−87) and thirty children with ASD, matched on CA and DA and developmental quotients (DQ), were compared to thirty TD children (CA ranged from 12 to 24 months). Methods: Cognitive and socio-emotional developmental levels, DA and DQ were assessed with appropriated tests. Results: More socio-emotional developmental similarities were observed between TD and RSTS 1 than between TD and ASD children. Clinical groups displayed similar developmental delays in cognitive (self-image, symbolic play, means-ends, and object permanence) and socio-emotional domains (language and imitation). Children with RSTS 1 exhibited higher developmental levels in behavior regulation, joint attention, affective relations, emotional expression domains, and a lower developmental level in spatial relations domain. Conclusions: Common interventions centered on symbolic play, self-image, language, and imitation for both clinical groups, and differentiated interventions centered on spatial abilities for RSTS 1 children and on social abilities for ASD could be used by caregivers were suggested. © 2021	AE	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		SK	0	0	0	1	0	0	0		5	4	0	5	5	0	0	1

Journal of epidemiology and community health	https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2017-208896	BACKGROUND: Higher cognitive function in childhood is associated with healthier behaviours and a reduced risk of chronic disease in adulthood, but it is unclear  whether this selection of healthier behaviours occurs in childhood or later in life.  The present study investigated how cognitive function at age 3-7 years was  associated with health behaviours at age 11. METHODS: Verbal, non-verbal and spatial  abilities were assessed using the British Ability Scales at ages 3-7. At age 11,  children reported how often they engaged in sport/physical activity, sedentary  behaviours (eg, reading and games console usage), cigarette smoking and alcohol  consumption. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds of engaging in health  behaviours at age 11 according to early life cognition. RESULTS: A 1 SD increase in  early childhood verbal ability was associated with reduced odds of attempting  smoking in boys and girls (OR 0.69 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.84)) and reduced odds of  computer gaming in girls (OR 0.79 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.86)) by age 11. Early childhood  verbal ability was also associated with reduced odds of regular participation in  sport/active games (boys: OR 0.91 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.99); girls: OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.74  to 0.88)) and increased odds of reading for enjoyment (boys: OR 1.47 (95% CI 1.35 to  1.60); girls: OR 1.48 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.62)) at age 11. Early childhood non-verbal  ability was associated with reduced odds of alcohol consumption in boys and girls  (OR 0.92 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.99)) and reduced odds of online messaging in boys (OR  0.89 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.98)) at age 11. Early childhood spatial ability was  associated with reduced odds of participating in sport/active games in boys at age  11 (OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.95). CONCLUSION: Neuroselection may occur during early  childhood resulting in some, but not all, healthier behaviours by age 11.

Validity, differences between subgroups of patients, and relationships to somatic and mental variables.	Aging (Milan, Italy)	https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03339874	To study the validity of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) in geriatric stroke patients, 116 patients were tested 2-8 weeks and 6 months post-stroke. A  neuropsychological test battery consisting of five tests measuring memory,  calculation and spatial ability was used for validation. Motor activity, depression,  aphasia and activities of daily living were assessed. Confusion in the acute stage,  Barthel Index, depression scores, level of motor activity, and most of the  neuropsychological tests correlated to the MMSE. Logistic regression showed 4  independent variables which could predict the MMSE scores. A factor analysis showed  3 factors which could explain 53% of the variance. The sensitivity for detecting  dementia was 56%, and increased to 68% if patients with isolated spatial dysfunction  were excluded. The MMSE had acceptable validity in detecting cognitive dysfunction  early poststroke in this old patient population.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Developmental psychobiology	https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.22155	Spatial abilities are not only fundamental for activities of daily living, but they are also markers of academic and professional success. It has remained a challenge,  however, to understand their development across childhood and adolescence, partly  because of the lack of spatial tasks that are appropriate across age groups. For  example, the well-established paper-based mental rotation test (MRT) has been shown  to be too difficult for children. In the current study, we tested girls and boys in  three age groups: younger children (5-8-years-old), older children (9-12), and  adolescents (13-17) on a hands-on visuospatial task using toy bricks: the  brick-building task (BBT). Children completed a low- and a high-mental rotation  demand (LMR and HMR) version of the BBT and the paper-based MRT. Correlations were  found between all tasks. Children, especially females, found the HMR more  challenging than the LMR condition, but all children successfully completed the BBT.  In contrast, the MRT was too difficult for the younger children to solve performing  at chance. Given this result and that the BBT is a game-like, 3D, interactive task,  the BBT could be used to examine the biological and/or environmental factors that  affect the early development of visuospatial abilities.

Phys. Conf. Ser.	https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/588/1/012041	A body of literature shows the significant role of visual-spatial skills played in the improvement of mathematical skills in the primary school. The main goal of the current study was to investigate the impact of a combined visuo-spatial and mathematical training on the improvement of mathematical skills in 146 second graders of several schools located in Italy. Participants were presented single pencil-and-paper visuo-spatial or mathematical trainings, computerised version of the above mentioned treatments, as well as a combined version of computer-assisted and pencil-and-paper visuo-spatial and mathematical trainings, respectively. Experimental groups were presented with training for 3 months, once a week. All children were treated collectively both in computer-assisted or pencil-and-paper modalities. At pre and post-test all our participants were presented with a battery of objective tests assessing numerical and visuo-spatial abilities. Our results suggest the positive effect of different types of training for the empowerment of visuo-spatial and numerical abilities. Specifically, the combination of computerised and pencil-and-paper versions of visuo-spatial and mathematical trainings are more effective than the single execution of the software or of the pencil-and-paper treatment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

Molecular genetics and metabolism	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2013.11.014	The lysosomal enzyme α-L-iduronidase hydrolyzes terminal iduronic acid from heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate, and is an essential step in GAG degradation. Mutations  of its gene, IDUA, yield a spectrum of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type I clinical  disorders. The IDUA mutation, c.712T>A (p.L238Q) was previously noted as a mild  mutation. In a longitudinal study of MPS brain structure and function (Lysosomal  Disease Network), we found this mutation in 6 of 14 Hurler-Scheie syndrome patients  in the age range of 15 to 25 years. We hypothesized that L238Q, when paired with a  nonsense mutation, is significantly more severe than other missense-nonsense  combinations. METHODS: Of 6 patients with a L238Q mutation, the L238Q allele was  paired with a nonsense mutation in 4 patients, paired with a deletion in 1, and with  a splice site mutation in another. This group was compared to 6 Hurler-Scheie  patients closely matched in age and mutation type. IQ and other neuropsychological  tests were administered as part of the protocol. Medical history was compiled into a  Physical Symptom Score (PSS). Assessment of IQ, attention, memory, spatial ability,  adaptive function and psychological status were measured. RESULTS: No group  differences were found in mean age at evaluation (17.8 and 19.0 years), duration of  ERT, or PSS. By history, all were reported to be average in IQ (4/6 with  documentation) in early childhood. All (100%) of the L238Q group had a psychiatric  history and sleep problems compared to none (0%) of the comparison group.  Significant differences were found in depression and withdrawal on parent report  measures. IQ was lower in the L238Q group (mean IQ 74) than the comparison group  (mean IQ 95; p<0.016). Attention, memory, and visual-spatial ability scores were  also significantly lower. Three occurrences of shunted hydrocephalus, and 4 of  cervical cord compression were found in the L238Q group; the comparison group had  one occurrence of unshunted hydrocephalus and two of cord compression. DISCUSSION:  The missense mutation L238Q, when paired with a nonsense mutation, is associated  with significant, late-onset brain disease: psychiatric disorder, cognitive deficit,  and general decline starting at a later age than in Hurler syndrome with a  mutation-related rate of GAG accumulation and its pathologic sequelae. This  particular genotype-phenotype may provide insight into the genesis of psychiatric  illnesses more broadly. Consideration of methods for early, brain-targeted treatment  in these patients might be considered.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

For this study, all 5-year-old children (N = 1138) living in a Finnish town (Lahti) were screened during an extended health examination and motorically delayed children were identified. A sample of motorically delayed children (N = 106 at age 7) and an age- and sex-matched control group (N = 40 at age 7) were followed at ages 7, 9, and 11, using a large number of motor and neuropsychological tests. The study also included teacher and parent ratings concerning learning and behavioral problems and assessment of cognitive abilities.    The problems in motor development which were detected by using a simple screening procedure (visual-motor and gross motor items and developmental milestones) tended to be clearly present in approximately half of the subjects up to at least age 11. At the age of 11, clumsy children had about a three-fold occurrence of different kinds of learning disabilities compared to the control group. The clearest behavioral correlate of motor clumsiness was inattention/passivity.    By using clustering methods, six reliable subgroups were identified at age 7 and re-examined at 9 and 11. Clustering was based on motor and neuropsychological variables. The main feature in the first subgroup was general developmental delay in motor and cognitive functions. The second group was cognitively normal but they had gross motor difficulties. The third group had problems in motor control, the fourth in visual-spatial skills. The fifth group had similar difficulties to the fourth but in milder form. The main feature in the sixth group was kinesthetic problems. The meaning of motor clumsiness as a specific developmental problem and the use of motor assessment as a part of screening also for other kinds of developmental disabilities is discussed.

Even though the importance of spatial abilities has been recognized, the percentage of preschool teachers who report teaching spatial abilities either through lessons or free exploration is a mere 32 percent (Sarama & DiBiase, 2004), which may lead some to question the qualifications of early childcare teachers. The educational requirements of early childcare teachers varies within states, for programs located in different settings or subject to different regulations, with the result that many practitioners do not hold college degrees, and most are not certified (Whitebook et al., 2009). Developing the knowledge, skills, and abilities to provide high-quality mathematics education can prove difficult with such a variation in teacher requirements from program to program and state to state.    The purpose of this research study was to examine in-service early childcare teachers' knowledge, methods, and confidence concerning spatial skills development in their classrooms. The participants included 88 in-service early childhood educators who are currently teaching in a preschool or early childcare center. Archival data that were previously collected utilizing the survey instrument,  Spatial Abilities Survey for In-Service Teachers, was utilized in this study.    The results of the chi-square and ANOVA analyses revealed a statistically significant relationship between in-service early childhood educators' level of education and their knowledge and skills associated with spatial abilities. Furthermore, a statistically significant relationship exists between the setting in which early childhood educators' taught and their knowledge and skills associated with spatial abilities.    With less than desireable performance in the areas of mathematics and science becoming evident through national assessments as early as 4 th grade (NCES, 2009), it is essential that our students be afforded a high-quality education as early as preschool, in order to provide a foundation for future success in these areas. A high-quality education starts with the early childhood educator and the knowledge and skills he/she brings to the classroom.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Conf. Expos. Conf. Proc.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095722117&partnerID=40&md5=8216477c9e9d23fa1ea29b7fa2658e49	This systematized review paper discusses the concept of spatial ability and its influence on students' success in STEM fields. My intention from this review is to identify what influences students' spatial ability and to draw connections between scholarly research to provide a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. This study will focus on nature and nurture influences on spatial ability differences. Nature is a term that is used to conditions placed upon children since their birth such as gender, race, and cognitive abilities. Nurture, on the other hand, is a term that summarizes the upbringing experiences that take place as children grow such as socioeconomic status, culture, hobbies, and childhood toys. I have performed this study by reviewing 35 peer-reviewed journal articles selected by a systematized procedure. Effects of activities on childhood and teenage spatial reasoning were explored. Activities such as construction puzzles, 3D sketching, and video games were found to have a positive correlation to spatial thinking and to have a positive association with self-efficacy. Students can improve their spatial abilities through training programs, which have a lasting impact of up to 8 months. The optimal time for students to have a training program is around middle school age to avoid adverse effects on the efficacy of spatial reasoning. However, it should be noted that the impact of training on students' spatial abilities in STEM courses may have a limited threshold in which additional training will provide a minimal effect on students' performance. Thus, it may be necessary to identify alternative intervention approaches and to expand the scope of who receive those interventions by looking beyond currently studied demographics. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

Behavior genetics	https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1021667213066	A parent-offspring multivariate conditional path model was fitted to specific cognitive abilities data from the Colorado Adoption Project (CAP) when the offspring  were 12 years of age. The sample included 175 adoptees, 175 sets of adoptive  parents, 175 biological mothers, 34 biological fathers, and 209 nonadopted children  and their parents. Consistent with results obtained from multivariate genetic  analyses of CAP data obtained at earlier ages, the effects of familial environmental  transmission on individual differences in specific cognitive abilities were not  significant. Assuming complete isomorphism (i.e., that the genetic and environmental  etiologies of individual differences are the same) between the child and the adult  measures, the heritability estimates for verbal, spatial, perceptual speed, and  visual memory were .26, .35, .38, and .53, respectively. Although the heritability  estimate for visual memory is somewhat higher than those for verbal, spatial, and  perceptual speed abilities, these estimates are not significantly different. These  estimates are higher than those obtained when the adoptees and controls were 4 years  old (Rice et al., 1986, 1989); thus, heritabilities of specific cognitive abilities  may increase as a function of cognitive development. Alternatively, genetic  stability from childhood to adulthood may be greater from 12 years than from 4  years, which would be interpreted as greater heritability by the CAP  parent-offspring design. The genetic correlations among the four measures were  substantial, ranging from .27 between verbal and spatial abilities to .78 between  spatial ability and perceptual speed. However, differences among these correlations  are not significant, suggesting that their covariation may be due to general  cognitive ability. Finally, estimates of bivariate-heritability indicate that on  average about half of the phenotypic correlations among the four specific cognitive  ability measures are due to genetic effects.

Fluid intelligence is a complex cognitive characteristic that can be defined as the ability to quickly and effectively find solutions to new unfamiliar problems without relying on past experience. At the moment, there is debate about the place of fluid intelligence among other cognitive characteristics. A number of studies have shown the links between fluid intelligence and working memory, shortterm memory, and longterm memory. Fluid intelligence may be a predictor of crystallized intelligence and learning ability. There are practically no studies of fluid intelligence in the Russian population. The aim of this work was to investigate fluid intelligence, methods of its diagnosis and its place in the structure of cognitive characteristics in a sample of Russian children. The study involved 55 schoolage children (M = 9.6 years, SD = 0.82 years). The methods used were the \№chsler Intelligence Scale for Children W I S C V and the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children K A B C I I . Both tests include fluid intelligence scales and scales that assess other cognitive abilities: shortterm and longterm memory, working memory, visualspatial ability, and information processing speed. It was found that, despite the fact that the tasks for the diagnosis of fluid intelligence in both tests differ in form and content and are weakly correlated with each other, nevertheless, upon factorization, they constitute one factor of fluid intelligence. Analysis of the relationship between fluid intelligence and different types of memory (shortterm, longterm working memory) revealed that fluid intelligence is associated only with working memory. It has also been shown that fluid intelligence is a predictor of verbal and visualspatial abilities. © 2021 Rossiiskaya Akademiya Obrazovaniya. All rights reserved.

Women and men differed predictably in their retrospective reports of childhood play and digit ratios, a putative measure of prenatal androgen action. Compared to the block figure items, human figure items on the modified MRT were associated with an improvement in performance in both sexes. However, consistent with the study hypothesis, the enhancing effect of the human figure condition on performance as measured by conventional scores was smaller in men compared to women and not at all evident in men when performance was measured by ratio scores. A closer inspection of the human figures effects on test scores showed performance in women improved for both male and female figure items. In contrast, relative to scores on block figure items, performance in men improved when stimuli were male figures but did not improve when stimuli were female figures. These results add to the evidence that the magnitude of sex differences in scores on the MRT may vary according to the test content and item properties. The findings suggest that online measures of cognitive processing in response to different classes of test stimuli (e.g., animate vs. inanimate objects, self-relevant vs. neutral stimuli) may prove useful in research aimed at understanding the hormonal and social factors contributing to the sex difference in performance on the MRT. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Archives of sexual behavior	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-006-9038-2	Eye-tracking technology was used to monitor eye-movements in 64 adults (age range, 18-22 years) during simultaneous presentation of "masculine" and "feminine" toys.  Women and men who showed more visual fixations on male-typical toys compared to  female-typical toys had significantly better targeting ability and smaller (i.e.,  more masculine) digit ratios, a putative marker of prenatal androgen levels. In  contrast, individuals with visual preferences for female-typical or male-typical  toys did not differ in mental rotations ability and in their retrospective reports  of childhood gender-linked activities. The finding that targeting ability and digit  ratios varied according to visual preferences for gender-linked toys suggests that  prenatal androgens promote enduring preferences for male-typical objects and  indicate further that some gender-linked traits vary according to the direction of a  visual preference for gender-linked toys. Visual preferences derived from  eye-tracking, therefore, may be a useful supplement to current measures of  psychosexual differentiation in hormone-behavior research, particularly because  eye-movements are not dependent on verbal abilities or subjective evaluations of  behavior.

Development and psychopathology	https://doi.org/10.1017/s095457940404458x	The hypothesis that prenatal masculinization of the brain increases risk of tic disorders in postnatal life was tested by measuring gender and gender role behavior  in 89 children and adults with a clinical diagnosis of Tourette syndrome or  obsessive compulsive disorder and 67 healthy, unaffected children and adults.  Consistent with this hypothesis, a tic disorder in females was associated with more  gender dysphoria, increased masculine play preferences, and a more typically  "masculine" pattern of performance on two sex-typed spatial tasks. Males with tic  disorders reported increased masculine play preferences, and the strength of these  preferences was positively associated with the severity of tic symptoms. In  addition, unlike their female counterparts, males with tic disorders showed a  relative impairment in mental rotation ability. These behavioral profiles are  consistent with those of children who have verifiable elevations in prenatal  androgen levels. These findings therefore support the hypothesis that an altered  androgen-dependent process of sexual differentiation during prenatal life may  contribute to the development of tic-related disorders.

As a first test of the relationship between hormones and behavior in early infancy we measured digit ratios and salivary hormone levels in forty-one male and female infants (3–4 months of age) who watched a video depicting stimuli differentially preferred by older males and females (toys, groups). An eye-tracker measured visual fixations and looking times. In female infants, hormones were unrelated to visual preferences. In male infants, higher androgen levels predicted stronger preferences for male-typical stimuli. These data provide the first evidence for a role for hormones in emerging sex-linked behavior in early development.	AE	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		5	5	1	NA	5	0	0	1

In the mirror image task, the subjects were required to discriminate between the normal and the mirror images of alphanumeric stimuli presented in the upright orientation. In the mental rotation task, the same judgement was required, but now the stimuli were presented in various orientations other than the upright one. The subjects therefore had to rotate the stimuli, in mind, into the upright position before making their decision. In relation to the control task, which involved discrimination of these same stimuli but not any form of mental transformation, there were significant increases in the right postero-superior parietal cortex and the left inferior parietal cortex in both experimental tasks. For mental rotation, specific activity was seen only within the left inferior parietal region and the right head of the caudate nucleus. These results specified the parietal areas involved in a purely cognitive spatial process and demonstrated a close interaction between these areas and the anterior neostriatum and certain lateral frontal cortical areas in the discrimination of rotated forms of stimuli.

Although there are multiple case reports of schizencephaly and associated neurological sequelae, primarily in children, the literature regarding neuropsychological manifestations of schizencephaly is limited. This article reviews the case of a woman diagnosed with bilateral schizencephaly at age 29. Neuropsychological testing revealed intact intelligence and memory functioning. However, impairments were noted in attention, executive functioning, expressive language skills, visual-spatial abilities, and bilateral manual motor skills, all of which were adversely impacting her functional abilities (e.g., ability to be gainfully employed). Given the potential variability in deficits associated with schizencephaly, this case demonstrates the utility of neuropsychological evaluation for understanding cognitive and functional consequences of bilateral schizencephaly. © 2010 Psychology Press.

Peterson et al. (1999), defines mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as a transitional stage in which an individual’s memory deteriorates and his likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s Disorder increases.  The prevalence of MCI increases with age affecting approximately 18.8% to 28.3% of the older adult populations in the United States (Ward, Arrighi, Michels, & Cedarbaum, 2012).  Studies, such as Butters et al. (2004), have found that depression often coexists with cognitive impairment.  Although there are many available treatments for depression, treatments for MCI including computerized cognitive training programs are still being studied (Günther, Schafer, Holzner & Kemmler, 2003).  The few studies that have looked at the effectiveness of computerized cognitive training, such as the study done by Cipriani, Bianchetti, and Trabucchi (2006), have shown promising results.    The participants, ages 68-91, were residents of an assisted living facility located in Westchester County, New York.  They were previously diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which is a 10 minute assessment that has eleven tasks evaluating delayed recall, verbal fluency, visuo-spatial skills, clock drawing ability, executive functioning, calculation, abstraction, language, orientation, attention, and concentration (Nasreddine et al., 2005).  Participants also completed the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), which were given to determine the level of depression (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996; Yesavage et al., 1983).  Participants participated in a bi-weekly computer cognitive training program known as Lumosity (Scanlon, Drescher & Sarkar, 2007).  Data was collected prior to and during training over a six-week period.  A follow-up was then conducted after a two-month period to determine whether the changes have been maintained over time.      If computerized cognitive training programs can address symptoms with MCI, it is possible that the program can address depressive symptoms that are associated with MCI as well. Thus, it was hypothesized that a computer cognitive training program would lower rates of depression, as measured by the GDS in older individuals with a mild cognitive impairment, as measured by the MoCA.  It also was hypothesized that a computer cognitive training program would lower rates of depression, as measured by the BDI-II, in older individuals with a mild cognitive impairment, as measured by the MoCA. Visual inspection via graphic display of the depression levels at baseline and at the follow-up sessions were used to analyze the data.  The trend showed that there was only a decrease in depression levels according to the GDS and the BDI-II for Participant B.  The depression levels did not change on the GDS or the BDI-II for the other participants.  Therefore, neither hypothesis was supported.  Implications for future research are also discussed including the application of different approaches such as a larger sample size, the utilization of a control group, and behavioral observations.

Although there has been much research examining ADHD and its co-morbidity with language impairment, little research has been conducted on their learning profiles when these two conditions occur independently. The data confirmed that those with ADHD performed better in some tasks of verbal abilities (learning outcomes), compared to those with SLI. In contrast, children with SLI had relative strengths in some nonverbal tasks (WM and IQ) compared to those with ADHD. However when looking at academic performance, there were domain-specific links between cognitive abilities and learning outcomes: verbal skills predict verbal-based academic tests and visuo-spatial skills predict visuo-spatial-based academic tests, in both ADHD and SLI groups. This finding can have important implications for how intervention is tailored in the classroom, as domain-specific support could yield important gains in learning. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Eight of the tests were designed to involve stimuli and settings with which subjects would have everyday experience. Significant sex differences were observed only on 2 of the nine tasks. In those cases where sex differences were observed, the effect sizes were well below .100, suggesting that the magnitudes of the sex differences were minimal. The fact that no sex effects were found on 7 of the 9 spatial tasks allows, at most, the statement that males perform better than females on some spatial tasks. There is no justification for the global statement that "males excel in spatial abilities".	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

An attempt was made to increase ecological validity in the measurement of spatial ability, a quality that is lacking in the more conventional measures. One hundred and four children, 63 adolescents and 94 adults, matched for sex, participated in the study. The analyses indicate that of the eleven separate tasks administered, only one test (estimation of height on the floor) revealed differential performance in favour of the males. The children performed less well than the adolescents and adults, who generally did not differ from each other. Investigation of directional bias in over- or underestimations on size/distance judgements revealed that on the majority of tasks, subjects of all ages tend to overestimate. The implications of this study to previous research in the area are discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Less is known about their cognitive implications in the prenatal and childhood periods, when the brain undergoes its most rapid development. Objective: The objective of this dissertation was to explore the role of early life exposure to dietary L/Z in child cognition. We evaluated associations of (1) maternal intake of L/Z during pregnancy with offspring cognition in childhood; (2) early childhood L/Z intake with cognition in childhood; (3) maternal diet quality during pregnancy with offspring cognition in childhood. Methods: We used data from Project Viva, a US cohort of mother-child pairs. Maternal and child L/Z intakes were assessed by food frequency questionnaires. Maternal diet quality was evaluated using modified versions of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS-P) and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-P). Child cognitive and behavioral outcomes were assessed using standardized tests/questionnaires at infancy, early and mid-childhood. We conducted multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for maternal and child characteristics. Results: Mean L/Z intake was 2.6 mg/day in pregnancy and 1.0 mg/day in early childhood. Mothers were predominantly white, college-educated, and non-smokers. (1) In adjusted models, higher maternal 1st and 2nd trimester L/Z intakes were associated with lower offspring novelty preference scores in infancy [1st trimester Q4-Q1 means: -3.22 (95%CI: -6.39, -0.05)], higher Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT) scores [1st trimester Q4-Q1 means: 2.67 (95%CI: 0.13, 5.20)] and lower Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) Behavioral Regulation Index in mid-childhood [1st trimester Q4-Q1 means: -1.63 (95%CI: -3.22, -0.04)], indicating worse visual recognition memory in infancy and better verbal intelligence and behavioral regulation ability in mid-childhood. (2) In adjusted models, children who consumed higher L/Z in early childhood had higher Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test scores in early childhood [Q3-Q1 means: 2.40 (95%CI: 0.27, 4.53)], indicating better verbal ability, and lower BRIEF Global Executive Composite (GEC) scores in mid-childhood [Q4-Q1 means: -1.65 (95%CI: -3.27, -0.03)], indicating better executive function. (3) In adjusted models, higher MDS-P in pregnancy was associated with higher KBIT nonverbal [1st trimester High-Low means: 4.54 (95%CI: 1.53, 7.56)] and verbal scores [1st trimester High-Low means: 3.78 (95%CI: 1.37, 6.19)], and lower BRIEF Metacognition Index [1st trimester High-Low means: -1.76 (95%CI: -3.25, -0.27)] in mid-childhood. Higher AHEI-P in pregnancy was associated with higher Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Ability matching scores in early childhood [1st trimester Q4-Q1 means: 2.79 (95%CI: 0.55, 5.04)], higher KBIT verbal scores [1st trimester Q4-Q1 means: 2.59 (95%CI: 0.13, 5.04)] and lower BRIEF GEC scores in mid-childhood [1st trimester Q4-Q1 means: -1.61 (95%CI: -3.20, -0.01)], indicating better visual-spatial skills, verbal intelligence and executive function. Conclusions: Exposure to higher dietary L/Z, both in utero and in early childhood, and to a healthier overall diet in utero, were associated with better verbal intelligence and executive function in mid-childhood. Our findings support a role for early life L/Z intake in programming cognitive function in children.	AE	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		5	2	0	5	5	0	0	1

This phenomenon is called 'representational momentum' (RM). We examined the effect of mental imagery instructions on the modulation of spatial orientation processing by testing for RM under conditions of picture versus body rotation perception and imagination. Behavioral data were gathered via classical reaction time and error measurements, whereas brain activity was recorded with the help of magnetoencephalography (MEG). Due to the so-called inverse problem and to signal complexity, results were described at the signal level rather than with the source location modeling. Brain magnetic field strength and spatial distribution, as well as latency of P200m evoked fields were used as neurocognitive markers. A task was devised where a subject examined a rotating sea horizon as seen from a virtual boat in order to extrapolate either the picture motion or the body motion relative to the picture while the latter disappeared temporarily until a test-view was displayed as a final orientation candidate. Results suggest that perceptual interpretation and extrapolation of visual motion in the roll plane capitalize on the fronto-parietal cortical networks involving working memory processes. Extrapolation of the rotational dynamics of sea horizon revealed a RM effect simulating the role of gravity in rotational equilibrium. Modulation of the P200m component reflected spatial orientation processing and a non-voluntary detection of an incongruity between displayed and expected final orientations given the implied motion. Neuromagnetic properties of anticipatory (Contingent Magnetic Variation) and evoked (P200m) brain magnetic fields suggest, respectively, differential allocation of attentional resources by mental imagery instructions (picture vs. body tilt), and a communality of neural structures (in the right centro-parietal region) for the control of both RM and mental rotation processes. Finally, the RM of the body motion is less prone to forward shifts than that of picture motion evidencing an internalization of the implied mass of the virtual body of the observer.

On the way to global integrations, education that wants to have a marker - sustainable - incorporates principles of sustainable development in its base: the principle of reconcilability with nature, economic sustainability, social justice, cultural identity, global joint work. After all the reforms and wandering around, the school recognizes that environmental, sustainable education forms a new way and style of life with relationships organized among adults and children at school and outside the school in the local community. Finally, a sustainable vision of education reform in Serbia has been focused on creation of a system that will be able to get together and engage relevant factors and respond to their actual needs. The education system that wants to have an indicator of sustainability is decentralized, efficient, effective, qualitative, and transparent; it employs highly professional, reflective, creative and motivated teaching staff; it has been focused on learning and it is a standard-based; it offers a high-quality program, promotes the culture of evaluation, self-evaluation and development of the school; it fosters fairness, ethics, tolerance, constructive communications-it is able to meet special educational needs, it has included the perspective of the lifelong learning, and it has a support of educational technologies. In essence it is a reengineering of the human spirit by mental transformations inspired by the principles of ecology and ecological engineering that needs to be implemented through sustainable environmental education. This paper will analyze whether all the opportunities offered in Serbia by environmental education are used, and what the obstacles are that need to be overcome in terms of normative principles and reduction of the gap between what "is" and what "should be" when considering the discourse of sustainable development in Serbia.

We contend that students, in their working with pedagogical devices, engage in a training process in which they learn to regulate their own conduct so that they perceive space through the trained eyes of reason provided by Euclidean, school geometry. Our contribution is an analysis of the power effects of school geometry in terms of the fabrication of children’s subjectivities towards the shaping of the desired child of society. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

Twenty-four children and adolescents with no mental retardation were administered an extensive neuropsychological battery to investigate cognition in terms of memory, executive functions and visuo-spatial abilities. The results showed discrepancies between Wechsler's indexes with higher scores in Verbal Comprehension than Perceptive Organization and Speed of Processing. Memory assessment using Signoret's Memory Battery revealed a clear difference between verbal and visuospatial memory but no impairment between short and long-term memory. Concerning executive abilities, DM1 subjects showed greater deficits in processing speed than in mental flexibility, inhibition or working memory. This pattern of deficits could implicate a frontoparietal circuit in accordance with the neural networks involved in the adult form of DM1 and reopens the question of a continuum between childhood and adulthood neurocognitive impairments. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These stereotypes and the inequalities relating to these stereotypes are beginning to diminish, however, they still exist. There is evidence that channeling children into gender-appropriate behavior may limit their cognitive development. Studies suggest that children who follow appropriate-gender roles have lower overall school achievement, spatial ability, and creativity than children who follow less gender-appropriate roles.    Gender-appropriate behavior is largely an expression of many gender-role beliefs (GRB). These beliefs include convictions of what is appropriate behavior for oneself and others of the same or opposite gender.    The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between GRB and spatial ability in adolescents both within- and between-genders. Three GRB variables investigated were: gender-role orientation, beliefs about gender-stereotypes, and beliefs about occupational roles. Two spatial ability variables investigated were: spatial orientation and spatial visualization. In addition, 12 secondary independent variables involving family influence, task appropriateness, and experience were examined. Six paper and pencil instruments were used to measure the variables. The instruments were administered to a total of 172 white, middle-class suburban seventh- and ninth-grade students.    Findings of the study included:  (1) No major relationships were found between the GRB and spatial ability scores using correlational techniques (i.e., Pearson, multiple r, canonical). (2) Regression analyses revealed that the GRB variables had no potential for explaining the superior male performance on the two spatial tests. (3) Since the three GRB variables by themselves could not explain the between-gender differences in spatial test performance, the secondary independent variables were examined to determine if they could explain the between-gender differences. This probe did not provide evidence to support the notion that several independent variables in combination may contribute to between-gender differences in spatial test performance.    The following conclusions are drawn based on the results of this study:  (1) No apparent relationship exists within each gender between gender-role beliefs and spatial ability in adolescents. (2) Gender-role beliefs do not appear to have any potential for explaining the between-gender differences favoring males in spatial ability.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This neglect means that many spatially talented youths are not identified and nurtured, at a great cost to society. In the present work, we aim to identify behavioral and electrophysiological markers associated with visual spatial-ability in intellectually gifted adolescents (N = 15) compared to age-matched controls (N = 15). The participants performed a classic three-dimensional mental rotation task developed by Shepard and Metzler (1971) [33] while event-related potentials were measured in both frontal and parietal regions of interest. While response time was similar in the two groups, gifted subjects performed the test with greater accuracy. There was no indication of interhemispheric asymmetry of ERPs over parietal regions in both groups, although interhemispheric differences were observed in the frontal lobes. Moreover, intelligence quotient and working memory measures predicted variance in ERP’s amplitude in the right parietal and frontal hemispheres. We conclude that while gifted adolescents do not display a different pattern of electroencephalographic activity over the parietal cortex while performing the mental rotation task, their performance is correlated with the amplitude of ERPs in the frontal cortex during the execution of this task. © 2020 Anomal et al.

Verbal and visuo-spatial contributions to typical and atypical number development.	Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-0965(03)00026-2	Williams Syndrome (WS) is marked by a relative strength in verbal cognition coupled with a serious impairment in non-verbal cognition. A strong deficit in numerical  cognition has been anecdotally reported in this disorder; however, its nature has  not been systematically investigated. Here, we tested 14 children with WS (mean  age=7 years 2 months), 14 typically developing controls individually matched on  visuo-spatial ability (mean age=3 years 5 months) as well as a larger group of  typically developing controls (mean age=3 years 4 months) on two tasks to assess  their understanding that counting determines the exact quantity of sets (cardinality  principle). The understanding of the cardinality principle in children with WS is  extremely delayed and only at the level predicted by their visuo-spatial MA. In this  clinical group, only language accounted for a significant amount of the variance in  cardinality understanding, whereas in the normal comparison group only visuo-spatial  competence predicted the variance. The present findings suggest that visuo-spatial  ability plays a greater role than language ability in the actual development of  cardinality understanding in typically developing children, whereas the opposite  obtains for the clinical group.

The present research examined the role of visual cues generated during action in promoting infants’ mental rotation. We sought to clarify the underlying mechanism by decoupling different aspects of action experience and choosing to manipulate the visual aspect while holding other aspects constant. Fourteen-month-old infants were given opportunities to rotate a cylinder placed on a turntable; the cylinder was decorated with vertical or horizontal stripes. If the effects of action hinge on the quality of visual cues generated during action, infants should benefit more from rotating the cylinder with vertical stripes as they generate richer cues when each stripe moves laterally with the cylinder. As predicted, the infants in the vertical-stripe condition looked significantly longer at an improbable outcome than at a probable outcome of a hidden-rotation event, whereas those in the horizontal-stripe condition looked about equally at the 2 outcomes. The results suggest that the effects of action on mental rotation are derived not from motor experience alone, but from integrating motor and visual experiences.

Globally, children are the most affected. This paper reviews the pathways that lead to disability and impairments in child development in malaria-endemic regions. These pathways include: fetal exposure to malaria and antimalarial agents, neurophysio-logical impacts on the central nervous system through demyelination, immunohistochemical changes in the brain, and subsequent neuropsychological deficits. Consequently, malaria infection through these pathways may lead to deficits in growth, attention, memory, visuo-spatial skills, language, executive functions and learning disabilities. © 2007, by Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

Several shreds of evidence have indicated that spatial development can be compromised in the case of development with atypical sensory experience such as blindness. Despite the massive importance of spatial abilities for the development of psychomotor competencies across childhood, only a few standardized and experimental methods have been developed to assess them in visually impaired children. In this review, we will give a short overview of current formal (standardized) and informal (experimental) methods to assess spatial cognition in visually impaired children, demonstrating that very few validated tools have been proposed to date. The main contribution of this current work is to highlight the need of ad hoc studies to create and validate clinical measures to assess spatial cognition in visually impaired individuals and address potential future developments in this area of research. © Copyright © 2020 Aprile, Cappagli, Morelli, Gori and Signorini.

Cognitive stimulation using electronic games has shown positive results, especially by improving performance of the visuo-spatial cognitive processes, working memory, and attention. However, variables such as bedtime, sleep duration, and sleep regularity are important factors that can also affect performance at these processes. We aimed to analyze the relationship between intervention with games and cognitive processes in elementary school students, and the role played by sleep in any changes. The sample consisted of 42 students (age: mean = 10.0, SD = 1.5 years) and an experimental group (n = 21, of similar age). The experimental group participated in an intervention using the game Safari, which stimulates working memory; the control group was required to reproduce works of art with the software Paint. The participants completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children before and after the intervention, and their parents completed a 30-day sleep diary. The results revealed that the performance of the experimental group in visuo-spatial skills and executive skills improved after the intervention, and their performance at Safari increased significantly. The experimental group also showed significant correlations between sleep variables and visuo-spatial ability and attention. Our data showed that the observed improvement in visuo-spatial ability may have been influenced by the measured association between bedtime/sleep duration and performance. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

A brief neuropsychological test battery (visuoconstructive and visuoperceptual abilities, memory, ideomotor praxis, verbal fluency, spatial abilities, concept formation) was individually administered. In addition, a handedness questionnaire was included. In some neuropsychological tests performance was virtually perfect (Recognition of Overlapped Figures and Ideomotor Praxis Ability test), whereas performance in other tests was impossible (e.g., Block Design using a time limit). It was proposed that two types of variables were significantly affecting performance: (1) educational level; and (2) cultural relevance. Some tests appeared significant and meaningful whereas others were meaningless and even impossible to understand. The appropriateness of current neuropsychological instruments for cross-cultural assessment is discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The battery included some basic and common tests routinely used in the evaluation of language, memory, spatial abilities, concept formation, and praxic abilities. Twenty-five different scores were calculated. A factor analysis with varimax rotation disclosed nine different factors, accounting for about 70% of the variance. Factor I was measured by a Sequential Verbal Memory test and Verbal Fluency subtests (“verbal factor”). Factor II was measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale Visual Memory subtests (immediate and delayed reproduction), and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (copy and immediate reproduction) (“non-verbal memory and constructional factor”). Factor III was measured by the WMS Logical Memory subtests (immediate and delayed; “verbal memory factor”). Factor IV was associated with fine movements (tapping subtests, right and left hand; “fine movements factor”). Factor V was specially measured by the Information subtest of the WMS and the Boston Naming Test (“verbal knowledge”). Factor VI represented a “praxic ability factor” (ideomotor praxis tests). Delayed Associative Learning subtest measured Factor VII; and Digits measured Factor VIII. Factor IX was a “mental control factor” (Mental Control subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale). The implications of these results to theories relating to the structure of cognitive activity are discussed. © 1994 Rapid Communications of Oxford Ltd.

The purpose of this research was to analyze gender differences in cognitive test performance among children from continuous age groups. For this purpose, the normative data from 7 domains of the newly developed neuropsychological test battery, the Evaluación Neuropsicológica Infantil [Child Neuropsychological Assessment] (Matute, Rosselli, Ardila, & Ostrosky-Solis, 2007), were analyzed. The sample included 788 monolingual children (350 boys, 438 girls) ages 5 to 16 years from Mexico and Colombia. Gender differences were observed in oral language (language expression and language comprehension), spatial abilities (recognition of pictures seen from different angles), and visual (Object Integration Test) and tactile perceptual tasks, with boys outperforming girls in most cases, except for the tactile tasks. Gender accounted for only a very small percentage of the variance (1%-3%). Gender × Age interactions were observed for the tactile tasks only. It was concluded that gender differences during cognitive development are minimal, appear in only a small number of tests, and account for only a low percentage of the score variance. © 2011 American Psychological Association.

Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports	https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.12093	To analyze the effects of an intervention focused on increasing the time and intensity of Physical Education (PE), on adolescents' cognitive performance and  academic achievement. A 4-month group-randomized controlled trial was conducted in  67 adolescents from South-East Spain, 2007. Three classes were randomly allocated  into control group (CG), experimental group 1 (EG1) and experimental group 2 (EG2).  CG received usual PE (two sessions/week), EG1 received four PE sessions/week and EG2  received four PE sessions/week of high intensity. Cognitive performance (non-verbal  and verbal ability, abstract reasoning, spatial ability, verbal reasoning and  numerical ability) was assessed by the Spanish Overall and Factorial Intelligence  Test, and academic achievement by school grades. All the cognitive performance  variables, except verbal reasoning, increased more in EG2 than in CG (all P < 0.05).  Average school grades (e.g., mathematics) increased more in EG2 than in CG. Overall,  EG2 improved more than EG1, without differences between EG1 and CG. Increased PE can  benefit cognitive performance and academic achievement. This study contributes to  the current knowledge by suggesting that the intensity of PE sessions might play a  role in the positive effect of physical activity on cognition and academic success.  Future studies involving larger sample sizes should confirm or contrast these  preliminary findings.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

One widely researched visuospatial cognitive task is mental rotation. Mental rotation is the process of imagining an object and performing visuospatial transformations of that object in one's mind. This dissertation will describe a series of studies that explore stimulus effects on different strategies used to accomplish a typical mental rotation task, the neural underpinnings of mental rotation, and the development of mental rotation abilities.    The first 2 studies used behavioral and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) methods to probe the differences in previous adult mental rotation studies by manipulating stimulus type (unmarked cube figures, UC, or feature marked cube figures, FC) and task instruction (Mental Rotation, MR, or Feature Matching, FM). The behavioral and FMRI data indicated that task instructions and slight changes in the stimulus could induce a switch in visual processing strategies. MR and UC elicited higher slope values, right parietal lobe and MT activation; while FM and FC elicited lower slope values, more left parietal lobe, middle frontal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus activation.    In Study 3, children were compared to adults using both behavioral and FMRI methods. The results indicate that children generally can perform mental rotation; however, the response times for children with high accuracy were more similar to adults than children with low accuracy. Also, children with high accuracy had similar patterns of neural activation to adults; specifically, they activated the right parietal and MT regions. Conversely, the children with low accuracy had activation similar to the adults who received FM instructions or FC stimuli and notably no MT activation. These studies present data that there are different strategies to perform a mental rotation task. Also, slight changes in the stimuli may cause a person to switch from a MR to a FM strategy.

Adult humans show remarkable flexibility in this domain, typically relying on internal cognitive processing when adequate but turning to external support in situations of high internal demand. We use calendars, calculators, navigational aids and other external means to compensate for our natural cognitive shortcomings and achieve otherwise unattainable feats of intelligence. As yet, however, the developmental origins of this fundamental capacity for cognitive offloading remain largely unknown. In two studies, children aged 4-11 years (n = 258) were given an opportunity to manually rotate a turntable to eliminate the internal demands of mental rotation - to solve the problem in the world rather than in their heads. In study 1, even the youngest children showed a linear relationship between mental rotation demand and likelihood of using the external strategy, paralleling the classic relationship between angle of mental rotation and reaction time. In study 2, children were introduced to a version of the task where manually rotating inverted stimuli was sometimes beneficial to performance and other times redundant. With increasing age, children were significantly more likely to manually rotate the turntable only when it would benefit them.

database	Armitage, Kristy L.; Redshaw, Jonathan	2021	journalArticle	Children boost their cognitive performance with a novel offloading technique.	Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13664	Ninety-seven children aged 4-11 (49 males, 48 females, mostly White) were given the opportunity to improve their problem-solving performance by devising and  implementing a novel cognitive offloading strategy. Across two phases, they searched  for hidden rewards using maps that were either aligned or misaligned with the search  space. In the second phase, maps were presented on rotatable turntables, thus  allowing children to manually align all maps and alleviate mental rotation demand.  From age six onwards, children showed strong evidence of both mentally rotating  misaligned maps in phase 1 and manually aligning them in phase 2. Older children  used this form of cognitive offloading more frequently, which substantially improved  performance and eliminated the individual differences observed in phase 1.

The present study examined the strengths of 30 children identified as "learning disabled" by collecting and interpreting data from four sources: parent questionnaires, parent interviews, children's personal documents (drawings, photographs, work samples etc.), and naturalistic observation. The theoretical framework for understanding strengths was Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences which has identified seven primary categories of intelligence: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. The primary suppositions of the study were that strengths would be found most often in intelligence categories deemphasized by our culture (especially spatial and bodily-kinesthetic intelligences) and that strengths would be found least often in intelligence categories most emphasized by our culture (especially linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences).    The suppositions of the study were generally supported by the data although it was noted that strengths were found in all seven intelligence categories. Questionnaire results of 98 items grouped according to Gardner's seven intelligences indicated that parents checked items having to do with spatial and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence more often than items having to do with linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligence. Interviews with 28 parents suggested that there were specific themes within each intelligence which deserve further study. Personal documents tended to support the view that children identified as "learning disabled" are strong in spatial intelligence, with 13 of the 33 documents analyzed consisting of drawings showing evidence of spatial ability. To determine whether parent attributions and personal documents were supported by observation of the children themselves, two children were selected from the study for home visits. Observations generally supported the questionnaire, interview, and personal document data for these children.    It was suggested that educators use Gardner's model as a way of assessing strengths and that they develop instructional strategies based on those strengths to assist children identified as "learning disabled." Finally, it was suggested that researchers develop new evaluation approaches for children identified as "learning disabled" which focus on determining the exact nature of their talents and abilities.

A case from Turkish culture	Humor	https://doi.org/10.1515/humor-2021-0054	This study aimed to investigate the relationship between intelligence and humor ability in a Turkish sample. The sample included 217 middle-school students with a wide range of intelligence measured by a Turkish intelligence test (ASIS). Humor ability was measured using the Humor Ability Assessment Form. Students were instructed to write captions for 10 cartoons that were as funny and relevant as possible. Seven experts rated the funniness of the captions and their relevance to the cartoons, yielding a total of 30,380 ratings (217 students × 10 cartoons × two criteria × seven experts). The findings showed that both general intelligence and the second-level components (verbal ability, visual-spatial ability, and memory) had high correlations with humor ability. Intelligence explained 68% of the variance in humor ability. Among the third-level factors, verbal analogical reasoning was the primary predictor of humor ability (β = 0.325, p < 0.001). Humor ability scores significantly differed across intelligence clusters, implying that highly humorous children may be highly intelligent. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

Infants viewed kinetic random-dot displays that specified three-dimensional cubes. The cubes were identical except for the presence or absence of an interior corner. Half of the infants viewed the full display. The other half viewed the central region of the displays, where the flow specifying the presence or absence of the corner differed. Infants in the full-view condition looked significantly longer to a novel cube than to the familiar cube following habituation. In contrast, infants in the partial-view condition looked equally to the novel and familiar cubes, ruling out the possibility that infants who viewed the full displays merely discriminated differences in motion in the central region of the two displays. These findings suggest that infants as young as 8 weeks perceive three-dimensional object shape from optic flow.

There was no evidence of major genes segregating in three other tests of spatial ability, or in tests measuring verbal ability, perceptual speed, or memory. The results supported the hypothesis that superior performance on ETS Hidden Patterns (HP) and Raven's Progressive Matrices (PM) is due in part to an autosomal dominant gene that accounts for 32% of the phenotypic variation in HP and 37% of the variation in PM. Evidence for a sex-limited autosomal dominant gene was found for a modification of the Shepard-Metzler Mental Rotations (MR) test, and 48% of the phenotypic variation in MR could be accounted for by this gene. © 1979 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Improved spatial skills are related to the improved performance in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Research has shown advantages to using technology for improving spatial ability skills, but interaction may be limited to the individual or in time allotted with technology due to costs. My research focused on investigating the advantages in using mobile touch-based technology that facilitated task focused talk for enabling children (aging from 7 to 15 years old) to practice their spatial ability skills. My research also determined the performance and strategic planning differences for different collaboration styles of interaction and among gender types.    I designed and developed a mobile touch based application that will allow children to perform spatial ability tasks in a fun way. This application incorporated four different collaboration interaction styles (co-located with shared screens, co-located with directional passing, remote with shared screens, and remote with directional passing). I used this application in an evaluation with a 4×4 mixed subjects design where the group dynamics were considered (FFF, FFM, FMM, and MMM), where M = Male and F = Female. My results have implications for how collaboration interaction styles affect performance and strategy when practicing spatial tasks and for how male and female children are assigned groups in collaborative learning tasks.

Earth Environ. Sci.	https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/419/1/012094	The home-school journey is a part of less privileged children's daily routine in Makassar. Children's repetitive engagement with elements of the street environment contributes to their growth and development. This study determines the actual friendliness of route for less privileged children along their homeschool journey that lead them to perceive the street as their play space. Participatory observation and behavior mapping were conducted to 10 less privileged children, aged 9 to 11. Their movement, social play, place of visit and preferred route were elicited during their journey from home to school and back. The site was a neighborhood in the old city zone of Makassar. The data was analysis using GIS heat-map. It is found that less privileged children perceive the home-school journey as a route to reach their school as well as a place space especially coming back from school to home. Utilized and shaped affordances of school to home journey were more than those gained from home to school. Boys practiced a longer journey than girls on their way back from school to home. It means that the geography of less privileged children at urban street generates spatial skill through social play. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pediatric reports	https://doi.org/10.3390/pediatric12030028	Background: While parental education and family socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with an increase in children's cognitive functioning, and less is known  about racial variation in these effects. Minorities' Diminished Returns (MDRs)  suggest that, under racism and social stratification, family SES and particularly  parental education show weaker effects on children's tangible outcomes for  marginalized, racialized, and minoritized families, particularly Blacks, compared to  Whites. Aim: We conducted this study to compare the effect of parental education on  children's mental rotation abilities, as an important aspect of cognitive function,  by race. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 11,135 9-10-year-old American  children. Data came from baseline of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development  (ABCD) study. The independent variable was parental education. The dependent  variable, mental rotation, was measured by the Little Man Task. Ethnicity, gender,  age, marital status, and household income were the covariates. Results: Parental  education was positively associated with mental rotation. However, parental  education showed a weaker association with mental rotation in Black than in White  families. This was documented by a significant interaction between race and parental  education on children's efficiency score. Conclusion: Parental education shows a  weaker correlation with mental rotation of Black rather than White children, which  is probably because of racism, social stratification, and discrimination. This  finding is in line with the MDRs phenomenon and suggests that marginalization and  racism may interfere with the influences of parental assets and resources and Black  American children's development.

The extent to which mothers directed their children’s behavior at age 2 was examined in the model for its importance as an environmental influence. Full-term (n = 90) and preterm children (n = 160) were seen at 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 years of age with their mothers to measure children’s cognitive and math abilities and observe mothers’ directive interactive style. Hypotheses concerning the negative effects of maternal directiveness at age 2, acting as a direct environmental influence on visual–spatial and executive-processing skills and an indirect influence on later math abilities, were supported. In addition, visual–spatial and executive-processing skills were found to have their own specific effects on math abilities. Visual–spatial skills were found to provide an important early foundation for both executive processing, and later, math abilities. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of the parenting environment and interrelations among a core group of basic skills necessary for understanding children’s later math competence. © 2003 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

Journal of child neurology	https://doi.org/10.1177/088307389601100610	Neuropsychological studies of children who have brain tumors have yielded diverse results with respect to identifying factors that contribute to poor intellectual  outcome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between pre- and  perioperative events, tumor-related factors, and the neuropsychological status of  children diagnosed with astrocytoma. Events that could potentially be detrimental to  neuropsychological outcome were quantified utilizing a new "neurological severity  score." The Neurological Severity Score was developed as a research tool to test our  hypothesis that ultimate intellectual outcome is a result of cumulative, interactive  insults on the central nervous system. This study constitutes a first step in  examining the predictive value of the Neurological Severity Score by evaluating its  correlation with baseline neuropsychological status. Fifty-nine children who had  astrocytoma (36 supratentorial and 23 infratentorial) received complete neurological  and neuropsychological evaluations within 3 months of diagnosis. Each child's  neurological history and examination results were scored by an independent observer  using the Neurological Severity Score. Neuroimages obtained at diagnosis and at the  time of neuropsychological testing were evaluated as well. For the group as a whole,  memory, attention, and motor abilities were significantly below age-appropriate  norms, whereas intelligence, language, and academic skills were preserved. Patterns  of deficits were identified and related to tumor site. There were no significant  differences in mean neuropsychological domain scores between groups based on gender,  pre-versus post-operative status, ethnicity, tumor grade, or abnormalities on  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The Neurological Severity Score was significantly  inversely correlated with visual-spatial skills, memory, attention, performance IQ,  and global IQ. In conclusion, among all the medical and neurological factors present  at diagnosis, the neurological severity score had the highest correlation with  neuropsychological scores. This instrument has promise as a research tool in  investigations of the psychological effects of cancer and its treatment on children.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Here we focused on spatial skills, which are important for learning in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Fostering students’ spatial skills may rely on teachers’ comfort in implementing spatially demanding activities in the classroom. This study used nationally representative data from Project TALENT to examine the spatial skills of high school students who later became preschool to high school teachers (n = 4,428 teachers). Results showed that secondary STEM teachers had stronger spatial skills than secondary non-STEM teachers (by 0.5 standard deviations) and preschool and primary teachers (by 0.8 standard deviations). These differences remained substantial even after accounting for differences in general intelligence and gender distributions. These results suggest the need for research on how teachers’ spatial skills impact students’ spatial skills and STEM learning.

It discusses the links between attention and the child's other cognitive abilities, including planning and executing actions, and how these dynamic developmental interactions between different neural systems may be altered in atypical development from birth through early childhood. A key concept is the broad division of the visual brain into 'ventral' and 'dorsal' cortical streams. Dorsal-stream deficits are consistent with the characteristic visuocognitive profile found in Williams syndrome (WS). The second part of the chapter presents some evidence on the form these problems take in the visuospatial and visuomotor abilities in children with WS. Lastly, the chapter discusses the overlap between the brain networks controlling action systems and those involved in attention. This means that when visuospatial deficits are considered, these may be associated with deficits of attention. © Oxford University Press, 2012. All rights reserved.

This study examines this issue in patients with Turner syndrome (TS), a genetic condition characterized by a specific cognitive profile frequently associating poor mathematical achievement, low spatial skills and reduced STM abilities. In order to identify the influence of visuo-spatial and STM processing on numerical magnitude abilities, twenty female participants with TS and twenty control female participants matched for verbal IQ and education level were administered a series of magnitude comparison tasks. The tasks differed on the nature of the magnitude to be processed (continuous, discrete and symbolic magnitude), on visuo-spatial processing requirement (no/high) and on STM demands (low in simultaneous presentation vs. high in sequential presentation). Our results showed a lower acuity when participants with TS compared the numerical magnitudes of stimuli presented sequentially (low visuo-spatial processing and high STM load: Dot sequence and Sound sequence) while no difference was observed in the numerical comparison of sets presented simultaneously. In addition, the group difference in sequential tasks disappeared when controlling for STM abilities. Finally, both groups demonstrated similar performance when comparing continuous or symbolic magnitude stimuli and they exhibited comparable subitizing abilities. These results highlight the importance of STM abilities in extracting numerosity through a sequential presentation and underline the importance of considering the impact of format presentation on magnitude judgments. © 2017 Attout et al.

As most of the numerical and non-numerical magnitude abilities underpinning mathematical development are visual by nature, they are often assessed in the visual modality, thereby confusing visuo-spatial and numerical processing. In order to assess the influence of visuo-spatial processing on numerical magnitude representation, we examined magnitude processing in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a genetic condition characterized by a cognitive profile with a relative weakness in visuo-spatial abilities but with preserved verbal abilities. Twenty-seven participants with 22q11DS were compared to two control groups (one matched on verbal intelligence and the other on visuo-spatial abilities) on several magnitude comparison tasks each with different visuo-spatial processing requirements. Our results showed that participants with 22q11DS present a consistent pattern of impairment in magnitude comparison tasks requiring the processing of visuo-spatial dimensions: comparison of lengths and collections. In contrast, their performance did not differ from the control groups in a visual task with no spatial processing requirement (i.e. numerical comparison of flashed dot sequences) or in auditory tasks (i.e., duration comparison and numerical comparison of sound sequences). Finally, a specific deficit of enumeration processes was observed in the subitizing range. Taken together, these results show that deficits in magnitude can occur as a consequence of a visuo-spatial deficit. This highlights the influence of the nature of the tasks selected to assess magnitude representation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Other research suggests that superior visuospatial abilities of people with dyslexia may not have been so far identified because of the lack of appropriate tests of real-life spatial ability. A recent small-scale study found that visuospatial superiority was evident in men with dyslexia. This study assessed the visuospatial ability of adolescents with dyslexia in order to determine whether these adolescents performed better on a pseudo real-life visuospatial test than did their nondyslexic peers. Forty-two adolescents took part in the study. There was an equal numerical split between the experimental and control groups. The experimental group all had a diagnosis of dyslexia by an educational psychologist or specialist teacher. Visuospatial ability was assessed using the Recall of Designs and the Pattern Construction subtests from the British Ability Scales (2nd edition; BAS-11) together with a computer-generated virtual environment test. The assessments were administered in a counterbalanced order. Adolescents with dyslexia tended to perform less well than their nondyslexic peers on the BAS-11 tests; however, this difference was not statistically significant. For the computer-generated virtual environment test (pseudo real-life measure), statistically significant higher scores were achieved by the dyslexic group. These findings suggest that adolescents with dyslexia may exhibit superior visuospatial strengths on certain pseudo real-life tests of spatial ability. The usefulness of these findings is discussed in relation to possible implications for assessment and educational intervention programs for adolescents with dyslexia. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

A wide range of interviews and the analysis of data from the city's "pupil database" have allowed us to evaluate the role of "contexts" in the academic parenting strategies, as well as to underline the role of various actors (institutions and parents) in increasing inequalities in the school system. In the Integrated Development Zone (IDC) of the socially diverse and northern neighborhood of "les Hauts de Sainte-Marthe", the refusal to assign one's children to schools near one's residence has resulted in a declining contact between new inhabitants and the neighborhood. In the IDC of Château Gombert, a relatively homogenous neighborhood in the 13th district, this school districting policy along with elitist academic segregation has led to social withdrawal in both school and residential environments. In the Euroméditerranée zone, institutions are in fact reproducing inequalities in a two-tier school system. The combined effects of the different actors involved clearly contribute to the strengthening of socio-spatial segregation and to the diversification of its forms in the city. © 2012 Lavoisier, Paris.

It then reviews the role of hormones in sexual differentiation, and methodologies for the investigation of FT effects on postnatal behaviour. Chapter 2 examines whether amniotic FT levels are related to Mental Rotation, Embedded Figures and Targeting, all chosen because these show sex differences (male advantages). FT levels were found to be  positively  related to Embedded Figures score in both boys and girls, but not Mental Rotation or Targeting scores. Chapter 3 investigates if FT is related to childhood gender-related behaviour, finding a  positive  association between FT and male-typical scores on a questionnaire measuring sex-typical play. In a further measure of other sex-typical traits, a positive association was further observed between FT and masculinity scores. Chapter 4 examines if FT levels influence scores on two measures of aggression. Results showed no sex differences or associations for either of these measures.    In Chapter 5, the development of childrenâ��s versions of the Emphasising (EQ) and Systemising Quotients (SQ) are reported and typical sex differences are investigated. Results confirm patterns found in adults (higher EQ in females, higher SQ in males). Children with ASC fitted a â��hyper-masculinisedâ�� profile, irrespective of sex. A further investigation showed FT was  positively  correlated with SQ and  negatively  correlated with EQ. Chapter 6 directly investigates links between FT levels and autistic traits. FT levels were  positively  associated with scores on the Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) and an adapted version of the Autism Spectrum Quotient for children (AQ-C). Chapter 7 revealed a similar  positive  correlation between FT and the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (the Q-CHAT). No correlation was found between Q-CHAT score and neonatal testosterone or prenatal oestradiol.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	No access; but apparently same study as auyeung_2012	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	3	3	0	0	1

A series of tasks were used: the  children's Embedded Figures Test (EFT) (a test of attention to detail), a ball  targeting task (measuring hand-eye coordination), and a computerized mental rotation  task (measuring rotational ability). FT was a significant predictor for EFT scores  in both boys and girls, with boys also showing a clear advantage for this task. No  significant sex differences were observed in targeting. Boys scored higher than  girls on mental rotation. However, no significant relationships were observed  between FT and targeting or mental rotation. Girls' performance on the mental  rotation and targeting tasks was significantly related to age, indicating that these  tasks may have been too difficult for the younger children. These results indicate  that FT has a significant role in some aspects of cognitive development but that  further work is needed to understand its effect on the different aspects of  visuospatial ability.

Research findings from human studies designed to elucidate the effects of both prenatal and postnatal exposure to hormones in children and young adults are summarized. Effects are found to be both time and dose dependent, with exposure to abnormal hormone levels having a limited impact outside the "critical window" in development. Particular attention is given to the role of prenatal hormone exposure, which appears to be vital for early organization of the brain. In later life, measurements of circulating hormone levels and the administration of testosterone and oxytocin are found to predict behavior, but the effect is thought to be one of "activation" or "fine-tuning" of the early organization of the brain. Possible directions for valuable future research are discussed.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Specifically, the study explored the effects of shape-based training on 4-year-old children’s ability to disembed and whether the training transferred to improvement in mental rotation skills.    Participants were recruited from preschools in the Central California Coast region. The treatment group included 20 children, 9 boys and 11 girls (M= 4.48, SD= .27) and the control group included 20 children as well, 10 boys and 10 girls (M= 4.50, SD= .27). Children in the control condition received a basic shape curriculum that focused on teaching children about shape attributes. Children in the treatment condition received the basic shape curriculum as well but also participated in activities that encouraged the development of disembedding skills.    Findings from this study suggest that minimal training can improve preschool children’s spatial abilities. Children in both conditions showed improvement on an embedded figures test and two newly developed spatial measures but there were no intervention group effects. That is, both the intervention and control group children improved in their ability to recognize shapes and disembed shapes. However, the improvements did not transfer to a mental rotation task. Correlations provide evidence to support the newly created measures as methods of assessing preschool children’s ability to disembed hidden figures and mentally rotate objects. The significance of the findings as well as implications for future research are discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in education	https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2020.589514	Past research has examined parental support for math during early childhood using parent-report surveys and observational measures of math talk. However, since most  studies only present findings from one of these methods, the construct (parental  support for early math) and the method are inextricably linked, and we know little  about whether these methods provide similar or unique information about children's  exposure to math concepts. This study directly addresses the mono-operation bias  operating in past research by collecting and comparing multiple measures of support  for number and spatial skills, including math talk during semi-structured  observations of parent-child interactions, parent reports on a home math activities  questionnaire, and time diaries. Findings from 128 parents of 4-year-old children  reveal substantial within-measure variability across all three data sources in the  frequency of number and spatial activities and the type and content of parent talk  about number and spatial concepts. Convergence in parental math support measures was  evident among parent reports from the questionnaire and time diaries, such that  scale composites about monthly number activities were related to number activities  on the previous work day, and monthly spatial activities were correlated with  spatial activities the prior non-work days. However, few parent report measures from  the survey or time diary were significantly correlated with observed quantity or  type of math talk in the semi-structured observations. Future research implications  of these findings are discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A causal link between these two facts and the existence of sex-related differences in spatial and mathematical ability is less well established, however; the relevant studies have simply not been done. Given this lack of knowledge, but firm support for the first two conclusions, the best course for education is to nurture spatial and mathematical ability more intensively, in both boys and girls.

This overlap facilitates attention to critical aspects of sensory stimulation, those that are redundantly specified, and attenuates attention to nonredundantly specified stimulus properties. This selective attention is most pronounced in infancy and gives initial advantage to the perceptual processing of, learning of, and memory for stimulus properties that are redundant, or amodal (e.g., synchrony, rhythm, and intensity), at the expense of modality-specific properties (e.g., color, pitch, and timbre) that can be perceived through only one sense. We review evidence supporting this hypothesis and discuss its implications for theories of perceptual, cognitive, and social development.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

A secondary objective was to evaluate the contribution of visual tracking as a mediating variable in the relation between locomotor experience and search performance. Precrawling (n = 20), crawling (n = 10), and creeping (n = 18) infants (M = 33 weeks old) were tested using a search task in which either they or the hiding containers were rotated 180° before search was permitted. The results revealed that locomotor status was related to search performance following a displacement of the infant, but not following a displacement of the containers. Moreover, visual tracking of the correct container was not related to locomotor status, even though it was related to search performance. These findings suggest that the effects of locomotor experience on infants' search performance are quite specific and are mediated by a variety of factors that do not necessarily generalize across search tasks.

Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development	https://doi.org/10.1111/mono.12288	Verdine et al. (2017) present compelling evidence for a causal effect of spatial skills on children's mathematics achievement in early childhood. In additional  analyses of the correlation matrix reported by Verdine et al., I present evidence  that the spatial-math link is not merely an epiphenomenon of general cognitive  demands of both tasks. However, the question of whether the link is due to a causal  effect of spatial skills on mathematics skills, a causal effect of mathematics  skills on spatial skills, or common factors influencing both during this  developmental period is a more difficult one to answer. I present a well-fitting  model that implies factors influencing both are largely responsible for the  correlations among mathematics and spatial skills across this developmental period.  This analysis is far from a complete account of the spatial-math link in early  childhood; however, I end with recommendations for moving forward most efficiently.

This biometrical parameter measures the relation between genotypic influences in one attribute with environmental influences in another attribute. A multivariate procedure for detecting the presence of both univariate and bivariate GE covariation is also described, based on a test of homogeneity of observed variance-covariance matrices in adopted and nonadopted individuals. An illustrative application to measures of specific cognitive abilities in four-year-old children in the Colorado Adoption Project (CAP) is provided. The analyses provided evidence of bivariate but not univariate GE covariance among perceptual speed, memory, verbal and spatial abilities in these children. A comparison of the results from the presently described and other more elaborate model-fitting procedures is made, with a discussion of the merits and disadvantages of each approach. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Therefore, connectivity analyses are vital in exploring information flow and temporal interactions between particular brain regions. This paper presents the results of two different types of connectivity analysis on previously acquired fMRI data of mathematically gifted adolescents and control subjects performing a mental rotation task. It has been hypothesized that mathematically gifted children rely on the parietal region and right hemisphere, along with utilizing inter-hemispheric interactions that may be a more efficient network during mental rotation tasks. Granger causality and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to model the connectivity in the two groups. The model outputs are compared with connectivity paths determined from structural equation modeling (SEM) in a previous study [1]. Although these methods can be used as confirmatory and/or exploratory tools, they may provide complementary, rather than redundant, information about connectivity networks within the brain. © 2012 IEEE.

The 5 days school, organized by Politecnico di Torino (Italy), was included in a larger project addressing 17 years old high-school students. Thirtyseven girls actively took part in a summer school, while 167 students (both males and females) were tested as a controlled group. For those who attended the summer school, significant gains were observed in four measures of spatial ability - mental rotation, spatial visualization, mental cutting and paper folding. For a minority of participants, scores on one of these tests, paper folding, were lower when measured at the end of the summer school but this was an exception. Furthermore, when tested several months after the summer school, the gains in spatial ability that were made during the course were maintained indicating stability over time with regard to the improvement in spatial ability. In terms of the experience of taking the course, the feedback provided was very positive and all but one participant would recommend the summer school to other girls at this stage of high school. © 2020 ACM.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.694728	Training studies extend developmental research beyond single-session lab tasks by evaluating how particular experiences influence developmental changes over time.  This methodology is highly interactive and typically requires experimenters to have  easy, in-person access to large groups of children. When constraints were placed on  in-person data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic, administering this study  format in the conventional manner became unfeasible. To implement this type of  research under these new circumstances, we devised an alternative approach that  enabled us to conduct a live, multi-session training study using a diverse array of  activities through an online interface, a task necessitating creative problem  solving, since most existing remote methodologies either rely on unsupervised  methods or have been limited to single sessions and restricted to a limited number  of tasks. The current paper describes the technological and practical adaptations  implemented in our online training study of 118 4- and 5-year-old children from a  geographically diverse sample. An experimenter interacted with the children once a  week for 5 weeks over Zoom. The first and final sessions were dedicated to  collecting baseline and post-test measures, while the intermediate 3 weeks were  structured as a training designed to teach children specific spatial-cognitive and  visuo-motor integration skills. The assessments and training contained image-filled  spatial tasks that experimenters shared on their screen, a series of hands-on  activities that children completed on their own device and on paper while following  experimenters' on-screen demonstrations, and tasks requiring verbal indicators from  the parent about their child's response. The remote nature of the study presented a  unique set of benefits and limitations that has the potential to inform future  virtual child research, as our study used remote behavioral methods to test spatial  and visuo-motor integration skills that have typically only been assessed in lab  settings. Results are discussed in relation to in-lab studies to establish the  viability of testing these skills virtually. As our design entailed continual  management of communication issues among researchers, parents, and child  participants, strategies for streamlined researcher training, diverse online  recruitment, and stimuli creation are also discussed.

PloS one	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055653	BACKGROUND: The contribution of different cognitive abilities to academic performance in children surviving cerebral insult can guide the choice of  interventions to improve cognitive and academic outcomes. This study's objective was  to identify which cognitive abilities are associated with academic performance in  children after malaria with neurological involvement. METHODS: 62 Ugandan children  with a history of malaria with neurological involvement were assessed for cognitive  ability (working memory, reasoning, learning, visual spatial skills, attention) and  academic performance (reading, spelling, arithmetic) three months after the illness.  Linear regressions were fit for each academic score with the five cognitive outcomes  entered as predictors. Adjusters in the analysis were age, sex, education,  nutrition, and home environment. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural  equation models (SEM) were used to determine the nature of the association between  cognition and academic performance. Predictive residual sum of squares was used to  determine which combination of cognitive scores was needed to predict academic  performance. RESULTS: In regressions of a single academic score on all five  cognitive outcomes and adjusters, only Working Memory was associated with Reading  (coefficient estimate = 0.36, 95% confidence interval = 0.10 to 0.63, p<0.01) and  Spelling (0.46, 0.13 to 0.78, p<0.01), Visual Spatial Skills was associated with  Arithmetic (0.15, 0.03 to 0.26, p<0.05), and Learning was associated with Reading  (0.06, 0.00 to 0.11, p<0.05). One latent cognitive factor was identified using EFA.  The SEM found a strong association between this latent cognitive ability and each  academic performance measure (P<0.0001). Working memory, visual spatial ability and  learning were the best predictors of academic performance. CONCLUSION: Academic  performance is strongly associated with the latent variable labelled "cognitive  ability" which captures most of the variation in the individual specific cognitive  outcome measures. Working memory, visual spatial skills, and learning together stood  out as the best combination to predict academic performance.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Malaria journal	https://doi.org/10.1186/1475-2875-10-334	BACKGROUND: Malaria is a leading cause of ill health and neuro-disability in children in sub-Saharan Africa. Impaired cognition is a common outcome of malaria  with neurological involvement. There is also a possibility that academic achievement  may be affected by malaria with neurological involvement given the association  between cognitive ability and academic achievement. This study investigated the  effect of malaria with neurological involvement on cognitive ability, behaviour and  academic achievement. METHODS: This prospective case-control study was carried out  in Kampala City, Uganda between February 2008 and October 2010. Sixty-two children  with a history of malaria with neurological involvement were followed up and given  assessments for cognitive ability (working memory, reasoning, learning, visual  spatial skills and attention), behaviour (internalizing and externalizing problems)  and academic achievement (arithmetic, spelling and reading) three months after the  illness. Sixty-one community controls recruited from the homes or neighbouring  families of the cases were also given the same assessments. Tests scores of the two  groups were compared using analysis of covariance with age, sex, level of education,  nutritional status and quality of the home environment as covariates. This study was  approved by the relevant ethical bodies and informed consent sought from the  caregivers. RESULTS: Children in the malaria group had more behavioural problems  than the community controls for internalizing problems (estimated mean difference =  -3.71, 95% confidence interval (CI), = -6.34 to -1.08, p = 0.007). There was  marginal evidence of lower attention scores (0.40, CI = -0.05 to 0.86, p = 0.09).  However, excluding one child from the analyses who was unable to perform the tests  affected the attention scores to borderline significance (0.32, CI, = 0.01 to 0.62,  p = 0.05). No significant differences were observed in other cognitive abilities or  in academic achievement scores. CONCLUSION: Malaria with neurological involvement  affects behaviour, with a minimal effect on attention but no detectable effect on  academic achievement at three months post discharge. This study provides evidence  that development of cognitive deficits after malaria with neurological involvement  could be gradual with less effect observed in the short term compared to the long  term.

Scientific reports	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-56003-y	Nonverbal Learning Disability (NVLD) is characterized by deficits in visual-spatial, but not verbal, reasoning. Nevertheless, the functioning of the neural circuits  supporting spatial processing have yet to be assessed in children with NVLD. We  compared the resting state functional connectivity of a spatial brain network among  children with NVLD, children with reading disorder (RD), and typically developing  (TD) children. Seventy-five participants (7-15 years old) were included in the study  (20 TD, 24 NVLD, and 31 RD). Group differences in global efficiency and functional  connectivity among 12 regions comprising a previously defined spatial network were  evaluated. Associations with behavior were explored. Global efficiency of the  spatial network associated positively with spatial ability and inversely with  socioemotional problems. Within the spatial network, associations between left  posterior cingulate (PCC) and right retrosplenial cortical activity were reduced in  children with NVLD relative to those without spatial deficits (RD and TD).  Connectivity between left PCC and right posterior cerebellum (Crus I and II) was  reduced in both groups of children with learning disabilities (NVLD and RD) relative  to TD children. Functional connectivity of the spatial network was atypically  associated with cognitive and socioemotional performance in children with NVLD.  Identifying a neurobiological substrate for NVLD provides evidence that it is a  discrete clinical entity and suggests targets for treatment.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In this review we discuss our recent work characterizing the real-world spatial learning and memory abilities of adult individuals with DS and WS. We used several different paradigms in which participants locomote freely and have access to coherent input from all sensory modalities to investigate their fundamental egocentric (body-centered or viewpoint-dependent) and allocentric (world-centered or viewpoint-independent) spatial abilities. We found unequivocal evidence that most individuals with DS exhibit low-resolution egocentric and allocentric spatial learning and memory abilities similar to typically developing (TD) children in the same mental age range. In contrast, most individuals with DS exhibit impaired high-resolution allocentric spatial learning and facilitated response learning as compared to TD children. In comparison, whereas most individuals with WS also exhibit facilitated response learning, their low-resolution allocentric spatial learning and memory abilities are severely impaired as compared to both TD children and individuals with DS. Together with work from other laboratories using real-world or virtual reality paradigms, these findings indicate that in order to navigate in their environment most individuals with DS may use either egocentric route learning that does not integrate individual landmarks, or a low-resolution allocentric spatial representation that encodes the relationships between different locations (i.e., cognitive mapping). In contrast, since most individuals with WS are unable to build or use a low-resolution allocentric or configural representation of the environment they may use visually and verbally encoded landmarks as beacons to learn routes. Finally, we discuss the main neural structures implicated in these different spatial processes and explain how the relative preservation or impairment of specific brain functions may engender the unique cognitive profiles observed in individuals with these neurodevelopmental disorders. © Copyright © 2021 Banta Lavenex and Lavenex.

A developmental study from kindergarten to the 2nd grade	Reading and Writing	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11145-012-9414-3	Research on reading acquisition and on the processes underlying it usually examined reading orally, while silent reading, which is the more common mode of reading, has been rather neglected. As accumulated data suggests that these two modes of reading only partially overlap, our understanding of the natural mode of reading may still be limited. The present study was set out to explore the underlying skills of reading acquisition examined using silent measures of reading. To this end, children acquiring reading of the phonologically transparent vowelized Hebrew orthography were followed from kindergarten to the 2nd grade. The relations between a range of verbal and visual-spatial skills with measures of silent reading were tested. Phonological awareness, RAN and vocabulary explained a significant amount of variance in fluency in word recognition and in fluency in decoding of pseudo-homophones, while visual speed of processing of numeric symbols explained a notable amount of variance in fluency in word recognition only. Phonological awareness, morphological awareness and phonological working memory were the main skills explaining the variance in reading comprehension. The relations of these skills with the quality of oral reading have been widely established in the reading literature. Furthermore, a similar developmental picture was obtained in the relations between some of these skills and silent reading, as was found with oral reading. Therefore the role of these skills in reading may not be restricted to a certain mode of reading. Also consistent with findings on oral reading, the role of the visual non-orthographic skills in the measures of silent reading was insignificant to very small. Together these results imply that the processes underlying measures of silent reading are not substantially different from the ones underlying measures of oral reading, at least not at the early stages of reading acquisition of a transparent orthography. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Int. Conf. Neural Inf. Process.: Comput. Intell. E-Age	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICONIP.2002.1202871	The aim of the experiment was to study the adaptive capacities of children to perform drawing movements while being visually perturbed. Children aged 5 to 11 (N = 47) and a group of adults (N = 10) drew diamonds via information provided through a computer screen. The screen display was either upright or rotated 180°. The absence of direct vision of the hand yielded more perturbation in the youngest group of children compared to all other groups. In spite of some initial difficulty, all children reached good control after 5 trials on the task. When faced with spatial rotations of the visual field, youngsters were again more perturbed than others. All children showed the same rate of adaptation to visual rotations, but they differed on adoptive strategies. Five- and 7-year olds shifted to a feedforward mode of control consisting in the production of a rapid gesture, followed by error evaluation in order to correct their next movement. Older children were characterised by a progressive integration of re-afferent visual and proprioceptive information. This resulted in an increase in duration of strokes and reduced speed, meaning enhanced on-line retrieval of information. However, nine-year-old children experienced more difficulty recuperating sensory information during movement than 11-year olds, and kept using error feedback. Finally, visuo-manual coordination in children aged 11, while only slightly differing from that of adults, was not yet totally mature. © 2002 Nanyang Technological University.

Advances in cognitive psychology	https://doi.org/10.5709/acp-0238-x	In order to explore the developmental patterns of sex differences in verbal and visuospatial abilities, the present study investigated sex differences in various  cognitive abilities among children and adults. Three hundred and twenty-six children  and adults completed a battery of six cognitive tasks testing two sets of abilities:  The verbal cognitive battery tested verbal fluency and short-term memory tasks. The  visuospatial battery tested mental rotation, localization, and form-completion  tasks. Results showed a significant Sex × Age interaction on the mental rotation  task, with men outperforming women in the 3D task, but with no sex differences shown  in childhood in the 2D task. Sex differences in verbal fluency were found, with  girls and women outperforming boys and men in this task. Findings are discussed  within an integrative approach of biological as well as environmental factors.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Use of this strategy has not been systematically studied in prepubertal children, a developmental period during which individual differences in spatial abilities start to emerge. In this study, children aged 8 to 11 reported their age and gender, completed a paper-and-pencil water-level task, and drew a map of their neighborhood to assess spontaneous choice of spatial frame of reference. Results showed a surprising lack of age or gender difference in water-level performance, but a significant effect of spatial frame of reference. Although they made up only a small portion of the sample, children who drew allocentric maps had the highest water-level score, with very high accuracy. These results suggest that children who adopt environmental-based reference frames when depicting their familiar environment may also use environmental-based reference frame strategies to solve spatial perception tasks, thereby facilitating highly accurate performance. © The Author(s) 2020.

Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS	https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617711000233	Preschoolers with spina bifida (SB) were compared to typically developing (TD) children on tasks tapping mathematical knowledge at 36 months (n = 102) and 60  months of age (n = 98). The group with SB had difficulty compared to TD peers on all  mathematical tasks except for transformation on quantities in the subitizable range.  At 36 months, vocabulary knowledge, visual-spatial, and fine motor abilities  predicted achievement on a measure of informal math knowledge in both groups. At 60  months of age, phonological awareness, visual-spatial ability, and fine motor skill  were uniquely and differentially related to counting knowledge, oral counting,  object-based arithmetic skills, and quantitative concepts. Importantly, the patterns  of association between these predictors and mathematical performance were similar  across the groups. A novel finding is that fine motor skill uniquely predicted  object-based arithmetic abilities in both groups, suggesting developmental  continuity in the neurocognitive correlates of early object-based and later symbolic  arithmetic problem solving. Models combining 36-month mathematical ability and these  language-based, visual-spatial, and fine motor abilities at 60 months accounted for  considerable variance on 60-month informal mathematical outcomes. Results are  discussed with reference to models of mathematical development and early  identification of risk in preschoolers with neurodevelopmental disorder.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.1999.89.1.339	Males typically perform better than females on tests of spatial abilities. However, Silverman and Eals (1992) found that females can surpass males on certain tasks, in  particular recall of object location. This study investigated the age at which  females begin having greater recall in object location. Recall was tested with  object arrays (sets of line drawings of common objects) using samples of 80 adults  (M age = 21 yr.) and 139 children at 3 age groups. Adult data replicated earlier  findings, indicating significantly greater recall by women. The samples of children  at different ages--4 yr. (n = 43), 10-11 yr. (n = 53), and 15-16 yr. (n = 43)--did  not show significant sex differences in this type of recall. The findings suggest  that females may surpass males in this spatial ability as adults, apparently due to  gradual improvements in spatial memory through childhood and adolescence.

Specifically, an audio-visual object identification task and an audio-visual object localisation task were used to assess putatively distinct perceptual functions in four age groups: children (8-11 years), adolescents (12-14 years), young and older adults. Participants were required to either identify or locate target objects. Targets were specified as unisensory (visual/auditory) or multisensory (audio-visual congruent/audio-visual incongruent) stimuli. We found age-related effects in performance across both tasks. Both children and older adults were less accurate at locating objects than adolescents or young adults. Children were also less accurate at identifying objects relative to young adults, but the performance between young adults, adolescents and older adults did not differ. A greater cost in accuracy for audio-visual incongruent relative to audio-visual congruent targets was found for older adults, children and adolescents relative to young adults. However, we failed to find a benefit in performance for any age group in either the identification or localisation task for audio-visual congruent targets relative to visual-only targets. Our findings suggest that visual information dominated when identifying or localising audio-visual stimuli. Furthermore, on the basis of our results, object identification and object localisation abilities seem to mature late in development and that spatial abilities may be more prone to decline as we age relative to object identification abilities. In addition, the results suggest that multisensory facilitation may require more sensitive measures to reveal differences in cross-modal interactions across higher-level perceptual tasks. © Copyright 2015 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Human reproduction (Oxford, England)	https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/det335	STUDY QUESTION: Are women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) better at three-dimensional mental rotation than other women? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women with PCOS  scored significantly higher on a mental rotation task than a female control group.  WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: PCOS is a condition characterized by elevated testosterone  levels. Some researches have found that three-dimensional mental rotation task  performance is positively correlated with testosterone levels. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE,  DURATION: This cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2006 and January  2009. The participants were 69 women with PCOS and 41 controls recruited from five  gynaecology clinics in London. The control group consisted of non-PCOS women of  comparable subfertility to PCOS group. These groups sizes gave roughly 80% power to  detect moderate effect sizes for the main statistical test. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS,  SETTING, METHODS: Participants were recruited at London gynaecology clinics. The  women were aged between 18 and 43. PCOS was diagnosed based on the Rotterdam  criteria. Controls were women who experienced some degree of subfertility. Blood  samples from participants were frozen for up to 4 months until being assayed by  direct electrochemiluminescence. The mental rotation task was undertaken  electronically. Some questionnaires and other tasks were completed as control  measures. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Women with PCOS scored significantly  higher than controls: median (range) 3.00 (0-9) and 2.00 (0-8), respectively (U =  1147.500, N1 = 69, N2 = 41, P < 0.047). Within the PCOS group, circulating levels of  testosterone were significantly positively correlated with three-dimensional scoring  (rs = 0.376, n = 56, P < 0.002), whereas estradiol was significantly negatively  correlated with three-dimensional scoring (rs = -0.473, n = 29, P < 0.010). In the  control group, the relationship between sex hormones and mental rotation was  non-significant. Other factors, including general intelligence and social class, did  not account for these findings. A subgroup analysis comparing hyperandrogenic PCOS  cases, non-hyperandrogenic PCOS cases and controls, in which age and body mass index  were controlled for using ANCOVA, found a non-significant difference in  three-dimensional scoring between the three groups (F = 1.062, d.f. = 1, 73, P <  0.351). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The small number of women in the control  group meant that correlations were underpowered in this group. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF  THE FINDINGS: This study is the first to find a benefit of PCOS in visuospatial  cognition, and the first to find a link between visuospatial cognition and sex  hormones in PCOS. The fact that the correlations went in the opposite direction in  the PCOS group compared with the controls might suggest the influence of increased  prenatal exposure to androgen in PCOS. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The  assays for this study were funded by the Department of Psychology, City University  London. All authors report no conflicts of interest.

Objects were placed under 1 or 2 of 3 cups by visible or invisible displacements. The series included 6 tasks: delayed response, inhibition test, A not B, rotations, transpositions, and object permanence. Apes and children solved most tasks performing at comparable levels except in the transposition task, in which apes performed better than children. Ape species performed at comparable levels in all tasks except in single transpositions, in which chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) performed better than gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and orangutans (Pongo pygmeaus). All species found nonadjacent trials and rotations especially difficult. The number of elements that changed locations, the type of displacement, and having to inhibit predominant reaching responses were factors that negatively affected the subjects' performance.

Several implications for teaching such HiS‐LoS and HiV‐LoS children are seen in these studies and considered in detail. Specifically the following implications are discussed: (a) the need for better identification of children with HiV‐LoS and HiS‐LoV profiles, (b) what kinds of reinforcers to use with these children in the classroom, (c) group vs. individual instruction, (d) the need to socialize the HiS‐LoV child, and (e) the need for care in academic assessment.

Archives of toxicology	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-019-02387-9	Polymorphisms of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene differentially affect neurobiological functions and cognitive performance and confer different  vulnerabilities to subclinical exposures to chlorpyrifos (CPF), a pesticide used  worldwide. The data reported on this topic suggest a complex interaction between  cholinergic signaling and the APOE genotype. To gain greater functional insight into  this interaction, we evaluated spatial learning and memory and hippocampal  cholinergic expression in young apoE3 and apoE4 transgenic mice exposed to CPF. Male  and female mice were exposed to CPF at 0 or 1 mg/kg on postnatal days 10-15 and  then, exposed to CPF at 0 or 2 mg/kg for 60 days at 5 months of age. At 6 months of  age, mice were tested for spatial skills in a Barnes maze. At the end of the task,  animals were killed and gene expression of cholinergic components was assessed in  the hippocampus. Our results show that apoE4 female mice performed worse in the  spatial task, while postnatal CPF impaired escape strategies and spatial memory in  apoE3 mice. In turn, CPF in adulthood improved spatial abilities in apoE4 female  mice. Regarding gene expression, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vesicular  acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) expression were increased in apoE4 mice. Postnatal  exposure to CPF increased ChAT mRNA levels in apoE4 mice, whereas adult exposure to  CPF induced changes in acetylcholinesterase-S, α7- and α4-subunit nicotinic receptor  expression in apoE4 females. The current findings provide new insights into  APOE-dependent cholinergic signaling, which directly affects the response to CPF  cholinergic insult, especially in APOE4 subjects.

The purpose of the study was threefold: to establish the terms preferred by elementary and secondary art educators for 11 psychological concepts critical to the perception and depiction of graphic material; to ascertain the relative importance of these concepts to those art educators; and to solicit information about the applicability of these concepts for instruction to students grades, K–12.    Results indicate that art educators prefer to use the following terms: for Edge Discrimination—“contour” and “edge of the shape;” for Figural Proportion—“proportion of the figure;” for Figure/Ground—“draw the positive and negative shapes;” for Gestalt—“Parts related to the whole;” for Invariants—“gesture;” for Occlusion—“overlapping;” for Right-Left Discrimination—“mental rotation;” for Value—“dark and light;” for Visual Centering—“background, foreground;” for Visual Memory—“to draw from memory” “mental pictures,” and “visualized image;” and for Visual Perspective—“illusion of space,” “linear perspective,” “one-point perspective,” “three-dimensions on two-dimensions,” “two-point perspective,” “to show the effect of depth,” and “to show the effect of distance.”    Art educators found that choosing one “most important” concept from the 11 was difficult. However, rating the relative importance of the 11 concepts for their students produced the following ranking (sequenced most to least important): (1st) Occlusion, Value and Visual Perspective; (2nd) Edge Discrimination, Figure/Ground, and Visual Centering; (3rd) Houral Proportion; (4th) Gestalt, Invariants, and Visual Memory; and (5th) Rigtit-Left Discrimination.    Art educators report that they teach all 11 of the concepts at all grade levels, K–12, countering evidence by psychologists that children develop comprehension of the 11 concepts at differing points in their development. The results are interpreted in light of four possible explanations: (1) art educators were not fully familiar with the concepts nor the grades to which to teach them, (2) art educators do not adequately assess acquisition of the concepts, (3) psychological research and school instruction may produce incongruous contextual influences on perceptual outcomes, and (4) the encasement of conceptual material, and subsequent explanatory power of concepts, may be mismatched across disciplinary boundaries.

First, research has investigated the development of MI employing a component model (image generation, image maintenance, mental rotation, image scanning), however knowledge of how components develop and their associations throughout childhood (age 6 to 11 years) is incomplete. Second, despite positive associations in adults, the relationship between MI and visual working memory (VWM) has not been investigated in children. Using a novel MI task battery sensitive to the visual precision of MI, we found evidence for a separable-component model of MI in children, with some components becoming integrated in adulthood. Contrary to expectations, there were no significant associations between components of MI and VWM in either childhood or in adults. Our findings extend current understanding of development of MI and highlight the importance of considering individual differences in strategy-use when establishing the relationship between MI and VWM. © 2021	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, there is no single accepted definition of what spatial visualization encompasses. Here, we investigated spatial visualization in the context of a mental imagery framework. We applied a component model of mental imagery, involving image generation, image maintenance, image transformation (measured using mental rotation), and image scanning, to determine associations between each component and mathematical calculation ability in primary school children (N = 92, age 6–11 years). We found that, after accounting for age, only mental rotation explained significant variation in mathematical calculation. Our findings advance theoretical understanding by demonstrating that spatial visualization definitions, applied to mathematics, should be refined to focus on transformation. This highlights the practical implication that transformation strategies are promising targets for future intervention work, rather than broad visualization strategies. © 2021 The Authors.

This spatial sex difference has been observed among young children, and it appears to increase in magnitude during adolescence.    Researchers have theorized that the spatial sex difference is due to differential learning by the sexes during childhood. If environmental practice contributes to the spatial sex difference, then males should be asymptotically sophisticated by comparison with females. This being the case, females should respond more favorably than males to spatial training. The present study was designed as an examination of this hypothesis.    A total of 67 adolescent volunteers (43 males, and 24 females) were randomly distributed across three experimental conditions. The control group received no relevant spatial training. Subjects in the non-specific training condition received instruction in orthographic projection. Those in the highly specific training condition received practice on spatial test items. Training was provided one hour per day for 10 consecutive school days. Administration of four dependent measures occurred on two days following training.    Multivariate analysis of the data yielded significant main effects for training specificity (p < .012) and sex (p < .038), while the training specificity by sex interaction was non-significant (p < .127). Subsequent univariate analyses indicated that significant effects had occurred on one of four dependent measures. Again, the main effects for training specificity (p < .0001) and sex (p < .027.) were significant. The mean for males was significantly higher than the mean for females. Furthermore, Tukey's procedure for testing pairwise comparisons revealed that the highly specific training condition was significantly more effective than either the non-specific training condition or the control condition. The non-specific training condition and the control condition were not significantly different in effectiveness.    Inspection of the cell means suggested that males benefited from both non-specific and highly specific training, while females benefited only from highly specific training. No support was found for a differential response to training favoring females. On the contrary, males responded more favorably than females to non-specific training. These results suggest that females may employ a spatial problem solving strategy which is not readily enhanced by either non-specific training or the environment.

Based on over 50 reported cases, FGS is associated with developmental delay (especially speech), hypotonia, postnatal onset relative macrocephaly, prominent forehead, frontal hair upsweep, telecanthus, or ocular hypertelorism, thin vermilion border of the upper lip, relatively short fingers with broad thumbs and halluces, persistent fetal fingertip pads, anal anomalies, and/or constipation. Major malformations are rare, and include pyloric stenosis, anal agenesis, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and congenital heart defects. Abnormal EEGs and seizures have been reported in almost 70% of patients. Brain MRI shows corpus callosum abnormalities associated with dilatation of lateral ventricles and, less frequently, periventricular nodular heterotopias, mild cerebellar defects, and reduced periventricular white matter. Chiari 1 malformation seems to be frequent. The behavior phenotype appears to be characterized by ADHD, and relatively less developed language, fine motor and executive function skills; whereas visual-spatial abilities seem to be a relative strength. Five candidate loci are already known but no gene identified. We describe 25 patients referred to the Stella Maris Institute for evaluation of DD/MR, and diagnosed as FGS. They were between 2 and 151/2 years at the first observation. High resolution banding, FRAXA/FRAXE DNA analysis, and subtelomere FISH analysis were performed in all of them, and all had normal results. Thirteen patients were followed-up from 6 months to 9 years. Our report focuses on physical, neurological, developmental findings, and natural history of FGS. Experience with our series of patients suggests that the syndrome may be common, and should be routinely considered in the evaluation of children and adolescents with DD/MR. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The father's role within the family has been most frequently viewed in terms of his linkage with the outside world through his occupation.    Recently, there has been a growing interest in the father as a parent, generated in part by several societal trends which are changing the structure of the family. An increase in divorce rates and the number of single parent families, increased maternal employment, and attitudinal changes towards traditional sex roles have created a need to examine our assumptions about the roles of individuals in children's development in order to determine the potential impact of these changes.    While there is some information about the effects of father absence on a child's development, there has been little research concerning the effects of father behavior on his child's cognitive development and acquisition of skills.    The objective of this study was to identify and describe the verbal behaviors of fathers during a problem solving situation with their six-year old children and to analyze the relationship of these behaviors to the children's performance. The research group consisted of 38 father-child pairs. The fathers were allowed to assist the children verbally during the first two trials of a Tower Building Game.    The verbal behaviors were recorded and coded. The father behavior variables including Orienting, Directing, Questioning, and Informing. The relationships of these variables to the child's performance on the third trial of the Tower Building Game, school readiness skills, spatial ability, and an intelligence measure were analyzed. Socioeconomic status, father verbal IQ, and child IQ at age 4 were used as control variables.    Orienting, Questioning, and Informing were positively and significantly correlated with the WISC-R IQ, spatial ability, and the Metropolitan Readiness Test. Directing was negatively and significantly correlated with these measures. When the relationships between father behaviors were examined, two contrasting styles of interaction were identified. Fathers in one group were high in Orienting, Questioning, and Informing and low in Directing. The fathers in the other group were high in Directing and low in Orienting, Questioning, and Informing.    The effects of socioeconomic status, father verbal IQ, and child IQ at age 4 on the correlations between father behavior and child performance were analyzed through partial correlations. The majority of the correlations between father behaviors and child performance remained significant.    The study results confirm previous findings that the use of direct commands by parents is negatively correlated with child performance. In addition, the results suggest that fathers who are high in directiveness display a limited repertoire of behaviors. A strong dependency on the use of direct commands as a communication style by a father effectively inhibits the child from taking an active role in problem solving.    A less clear case can be made for the positive relationship between other father behaviors such as Informing, Questioning, and Orienting and child performance. While these behaviors allow the child to be an active and perhaps a more effective learner, the study does not allow us to say that the father behaviors cause the child to assume this role.    The results of this study may have implications for parent education programs. While there is an appealing efficiency in the use of direct commands in accomplishing a specific task, parents should be made aware of the more general consequences of consistently applying this approach.

Progress in pediatric cardiology	https://doi.org/10.1016/s1058-9813(00)00046-1	Pediatric heart transplantation has become a mainstay in the treatment of end-stage heart disease in infants and children. There is, however, sparse information on  post-transplant developmental and cognitive functioning. At Loma Linda University  Children's Hospital 223 infants have undergone heart transplantation surgery with a  survival rate of 73% (n=165). This article reports on four areas of investigation of  this cohort of infants. Infant development: Two studies were done utilizing the  Bayley Scales of Infant Development (mean 100, S.D.+/-15). The first study (n=48)  showed mean values within the normal range [Mental Development Index (MDI) 87;  Psychomotor Developmental Index (PDI) 90]. The second study (n=23) showed  developmental scores within normal limits in 4-8 month olds with a tendency for  decline in development at 12-24 months (MDI 83, PDI 77). Child development:  Ninty-one infant recipients were greater than 5 years old. Forty-five children were  excluded because of long distances from the hospital, second transplantation,  abnormal karyotype, primary language non-English, or invalid testing. The Wechsler  Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised testing of 5-6-year-olds (n=23)  showed a Full Scale IQ of 74, Performance IQ of 76, and Verbal IQ of 77. The  Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III testing of 7-10-year-olds (n=23) showed  a Full Scale IQ of 86, Performance IQ of 89, and Verbal IQ of 86. The Wechsler  Individual Achievement Test (mean 100, S.D.+/-15) yielded a Total Composite of 91,  Mathematics Composite of 86, Language Composite of 98, and a Reading Composite of  94. Visual spatial skills: Visual motor integration (mean 100, S.D.+/-15) was  evaluated in 5-10-year-olds with a mean of 87; however, 52% of the children had  scores below 1 S.D. Subtests from the Wechsler scales that assess visual motor and  visual spatial skills indicated significant deficits. Behavior: Younger children  (n=33) demonstrated behaviors indicative of social isolation. Older children (n=36)  showed behavior that was within the normal limits, but depression was noted in a  significant number of them. Conclusions: Infant heart transplant recipients  demonstrate IQ and achievement levels within the normal range, but there is a  significant amount of variability with more children than would be expected scoring  in the lower ranges. Children with heart transplantation are at risk for visual  spatial skill deficits. Young children are at risk for social isolation while  symptoms of depression are noted in older children.

Research (Rauscher, Shaw, & Ky, 1993) indicates that exposure to music may be one strategy that effectively stimulates and increases visual-spatial problem solving in children.    This study involved utilizing keyboard instruction as a medium to effect change in selected areas of visual-spatial problem solving. Participants consisted of three, elementary students enrolled in a rural, Midwestern public school. The students had been identified by their school district as having a specific learning disability. Participants were provided with individual electronic keyboard instruction for approximately 11-15 sessions and completed tasks that involved visual-spatial reasoning. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of electronic keyboard instruction on students with identified learning disabilities, as measured by two targeted cognitive behaviors. A multiple baseline design across subjects was used. Outcome tasks were plotted on contiguous graphs and subjected to standard visual analysis. Visual analysis was supplemented by the use of independent t-tests to determine where significant differences existed between experimental conditions when pooling the means of all participants. Independent t-tests were also conducted to determine if there were significant differences between experimental conditions for each participant.    Results indicated that participants demonstrated improvement in both the targeted behaviors of mental rotation and paper folding and cutting. Level and trend changes were evidenced by all three participants on both visual-spatial activities. The targeted cognitive behaviors were found to significantly increase across participants during the experimental intervention. Results from an exit interview indicated that students (a) enjoyed individual keyboard instruction, (b) felt more competent academically, and (c) were able to concentrate better in academic settings.

The impact of different instructions on children's performance in hierarchical menu structures	Computers in Human Behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2007.05.003	Which kind of instruction helps children aged 9-14 years interact efficiently with a mobile phone? Due to analogies between navigation in menu structures and the natural environment, three instructions providing different forms of spatial knowledge were under study: A step-by-step instruction featuring landmark knowledge of the menu functions to be selected, a diagram of the menu structure providing survey knowledge and a free exploration of the menu, also giving the children the opportunity to develop survey knowledge. Results show a superiority of the two instructions that provide survey knowledge, except for the youngest children aged 9-10 years. This group showed to have lower spatial abilities and is therefore presumably not able to understand and integrate this type of knowledge. For those very young children, the landmark information given in traditional step-by-step instructions is more helpful. It is concluded, that simple diagrams of the menu structure can help children from 11 years on to significantly ease their interaction with small menu driven devices. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Since spatiality as a term is ubiquitous in experience this paper bridges literature in two fields: theories on early spatial learning in cognitive development and potential benefits of tangible user interfaces (TUIs) for supporting very young children's spatial skills. Studies suggest that the period between 2 and 4 years of age is critical for training spatial skills (e.g., mental rotation), which relate to further success in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) disciplines. We first present a review of the empirical findings on spatial skills, early interventions, and tools (i.e., narrative and gesture input) recommended for training preschool children's spatial skills. By situating the work within the use and benefits of manipulatives (e.g., building blocks, puzzles, shapes) combined with digital affordances in interaction design, we address the relevance of TUIs as complementary tools for spatial learning. We concentrate on the supporting properties of TUIs that enable playful learning, make storytelling more concrete, and provide embodiment effects through physicality. Through various products found in the market and literature that address the physical–digital convergence, we invite designers and researchers to consider design practices and applicable technology that build on present efforts and paradigms in this area. To contribute to this area, we conclude with a discussion of the gaps in design methods to develop technologies for children younger than 4 years old, and propose directions for future work to leverage new tools that serve very young children's spatial learning and possible inquiries for dual payoff. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

IDC - Int. Conf. Interact. Des. Child.	https://doi.org/10.1145/2930674.2936006	This proposed project aims to develop a researchdriven interactive product that facilitates spatial skills of preschoolers. Here, we present the preliminary qualitative results of a user study with the paper prototype of Fungram, merging physical tangram pieces on the screen within a narrative context. A pilot study was conducted with eight children between the ages of 25 and 48 months, who were presented tangible tangram pieces along with two sets of papers with and without narrative context. Our preliminary qualitative data indicates that narrative context helps children's coherence of abstract figures and triggers rotation of geometric tangram pieces. This study provide insights about children's user needs and action strategies within the proposed use scenario with graspable puzzle pieces related to screen interaction at this age range. We suggest that transmedia play expand opportunities for children to employ their spatial skills in different settings.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	0	0	0	1	0		2	6	0	5	5	0	0	1

However, the developmental needs and abilities of children under 4 years old have been insufficiently taken into account in the early stages of technology design. This paper addresses this gap in the child–computer interaction field by exploring how children between the ages of 2 and 4 years old interact with spatial manipulatives that facilitate their early spatial learning. To this end, we developed Embedded Figures in Stories (EFiS) method to elicit age specific knowledge about preschoolers’ spatial skills (i.e., mental rotation) and inform child-tangible interaction (CTI) design. To develop EFiS method, we modified intervention techniques for early spatial learning found in cognitive developmental studies and incorporated these into design methods used in CTI. In this paper, we first present an argument for why CTI design with and for preschoolers is important for early spatial learning. Second, we describe our method and how we applied it in a case study. Then, we discuss the potential opportunities and limitations of using the EFiS method, along with design guidelines for future use of the method. This study mainly contributes to design methods to extract age specific knowledge about very young children's spatial thinking skills, which lay a basis for further STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) achievements. © 2019	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

This paper addresses this gap in the research by exploring how children between the ages of 26 and 43 months interact with spatial manipulatives. To this end, we modified intervention techniques for early spatial learning found in cognitive developmental studies and combined these with design methods used in Child-Tangible Interaction (CTI). From the former we borrowed the Preschool Embedded Figures Test (PEFT), and from the latter a storytelling approach incorporated into structured tasks with hands-on tools. In this paper, we first discuss related work on early spatial learning and CTI methods. Then, we describe a case study conducted with 14 parent-child dyads. Finally, we present the results, which offer insight into young children’s mental rotation skills, different rotation action strategies and parental input requirements. Our findings contribute to design methods to elicit age specific knowledge about young children’s hands-on learning, and set forth techniques and design considerations for evidence-based CTI to scaffold early spatial thinking skills. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

However, empirical demonstrations linking intra-individual variations in spatial cognitive ability with movement ecology are rare. I reared ~200 simultaneously hatched pheasant chicks per year over three years in standardised conditions without parents, controlling for the confounding effects of experience, maternal influences and age. I tested the chicks on spatial cognitive tasks from three weeks old to obtain measures of inherent, early-life spatial cognitive ability. Each year, I released birds when 10 weeks old into an open-topped enclosure in woodland. Birds dispersed from this enclosure after about one-month. Importantly, all birds were released into the same, novel area simultaneously, thus their experiences and opportunities were standardised. I remotely tracked pheasant movement through either RFID antenna placed under 43 supplementary feeders situated throughout our field site (2016) or by using a novel reverse-GPS tracking system (2017-2018). Spatial cognitive ability, determined through binary spatial discrimination (2016) or a Barnes maze (2017), was related to the diversity of foraging sites an individual used (Chapter 2: 2016). Those with better spatial cognitive ability used a more diverse range of artificial feeders than poor performing counterparts, perhaps to retain a buffer of alternative foraging sites where resource profitability was known. I found no relationship between the timing of daily foraging onset between birds of differing cognitive ability (Chapter 3; 2016), which I had hypothesised to be a consequence of birds developing efficient routes between refuges and feeders. After establishing a reverse GPS system on our field site (Chapter 4: 2017), I collected more detailed information about pheasant movement and found that birds with higher accuracy scores on the cognition tasks initially moved between foraging and resting sites more slowly than inaccurate birds in novel environments, perhaps to gather more detailed information. Accurate birds increased their speed over one month to match the same speed as inaccurate birds. All birds increased the straightness of their routes at a similar rate. Lastly, I found intraspecific differences in the orientation strategy that birds used to solve a dual strategy maze task (Chapter 5: 2018). These differences predicted habitat use after release: birds that utilised landmarks (allocentric strategies) showed less aversion to urban habitats (farm buildings/yards) than egocentric/mixed strategy birds, which is potentially due to the presence of large, stable landmarks within these habitats. In this thesis, I provide several empirical links between spatial cognitive ability and movement ecology across a range of ecological contexts. I suggest that very specific cognitive processes may govern particular movement behaviours and that there is not one overarching general spatial ability.

Although research suggests that preadolescent children should construct representations of concepts to be learned, evidence indicates this type of instructional presentation is inconsistently or seldomly used in a focused effort in intermediate grade level classrooms. To examine effects of such a conceptual focus in manipulative-based instruction, this two-part study was conducted.    In part one, three different instructional approaches to learning the concept of area were compared using 820 children from grades 5, 6, and 7, in all eight K-8 schools in an urban district. Variations in treatment centered on the type of instructional material employed in each group: a single concrete embodiment approach (using a geoboard), a multiple embodiment approach (using flats, transparencies, cloth, squared paper), a textbook approach, and a control group. A five day experimental period was preceded by two spatial tests and an area achievement pretest, and was followed by a post achievement test and a delayed test.    While the first part of the study attended to achievement of correct solutions, part two centered on the modes of solution. The clinical component, which identified various aspects of the area concept through role playing tasks, focused on the process by which children understand area measurement.    Results from the two-way ANOVAs indicated significant differences (.01) favoring the manipulative treatment groups on both the post and retention tests. While grade level comparisons and grade-by-treatment interactions were statistically significant (.01), for practical purposes, the margins of differences were not significant. A multiple regression examined the relationship of post test achievement to treatment, pretest, and spatial ability, and found treatment, pretest, and an interaction of spatial ability with treatment to be significant (.01) predictors of achievement. Manipulative groups had similar achievement which substantially surpassed that of the textbook group. A comparison of interview responses found 60% of manipulative treatment students could solve area measurement problems that they were unable to solve prior to treatment. This compares to textbook students' success rates of 18% for grade 5 and 30% for grade 6.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Assessment	https://doi.org/10.1177/1073191111399037	This study compared the structure of cognitive ability (specifically, verbal/crystallized [Gc] and visual-spatial ability [Gv]), as measured in the  Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, in youth with manic symptoms with a  nationally representative group of similarly aged youth. Multigroup confirmatory  factor analysis found the majority of the estimated parameters were invariant  between the groups, although there was a difference in the intercepts for the  Similarities subtest and difference in unique variances for the Picture Completion,  Comprehension, and Picture Arrangement subtests. Thus, although there are many  neurological changes associated with manic symptoms, the structure of  verbal/crystallized and visual-spatial abilities appear relatively robust and  invariant. As Gc and Gv are the primary domains on all the Wechsler Intelligence  Scales for Children, results also indicate that clinical interpretation of the  Wechsler scales may be appropriate to measure cognitive performance in youths with  manic symptoms.

Innovation in aging	https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igy003	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Childhood socioeconomic status (cSES) is found to predict later-life cognitive abilities, yet the mechanisms underlying these associations  remain unclear. The objective of this longitudinal study was to examine the direct  and indirect paths through which cSES influences late midlife cognitive outcomes.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants were 1,009 male twins in the Vietnam Era  Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). At mean ages 20 and 62, participants completed a  standardized test for general cognitive ability (GCA). The age 62 cognitive  assessment also included in-person tests of processing speed, episodic memory,  abstract reasoning, working memory, verbal fluency, visual-spatial ability, and  executive functions. At mean age 56, participants were interviewed regarding their  own and their parents' education and occupation, and completed questionnaires about  cognitive leisure activities and sociodemographic information. Multiple mediation  analyses were conducted to examine the direct path effects and indirect path effects  of cSES through age 20 GCA, adult SES, and cognitive leisure activities on seven  cognitive outcomes at age 62, adjusting for age, ethnicity, and non-independence of  observations. RESULTS: Total (direct plus indirect) effects were significant for all  measures with the exception of executive functions. Men from lower cSES backgrounds  had poorer cognitive functioning in late midlife. The direct effect of cSES was  partially mediated for abstract reasoning, and was fully mediated for the remaining  six cognitive outcomes. Total indirect effects accounted for at least half of the  total effects in each model, with paths through age 20 GCA explaining most of the  total indirect effects. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: cSES predicted cognitive  functioning in late middle age Using multiple mediation models, we show that lower  cSES predicts poorer cognition in late midlife primarily through young adult  cognitive ability and to a lesser extent through SES in adulthood and engagement in  cognitively stimulating activities.

Sixty-one patients suffering from a WI were compared with 57 patients suffering from a MTBI and with 30 HC. They were examined with an extensive neuropsychological test battery assessing attention, memory, and visuospatial and executive functions. In both patient groups, participants showed persistent cognitive symptoms (more than 6 months post-injury). The two patient groups did not differ significantly with regard to measurements of attention, memory, and visuospatial and executive functions. The WI group, as compared to the HC group, was found to be significantly more deficient in speed of performance during sustained and divided attention, focused attention, alternating attention, the storage of new auditory-verbal unrelated information into memory, the long-term delayed recall of stored auditory-verbal related information from memory, abstract reasoning and accuracy of performance during planning and problem solving. No differences could be found between both groups concerning speed of information processing, visuospatial abilities and verbal fluency. © 2017, Belgian Neurological Society.

Journal of pediatric surgery	https://doi.org/10.1053/jpsu.2000.6866	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Improved therapies for the management of short bowel syndrome (SBS) have resulted in the prolonged survival of many children. By early childhood,  the physiological sequelae of severe SBS include delayed physical development and  metabolic imbalances. However, little is known about how SBS affects brain  development. Although many parents report school problems, no controlled study has  evaluated the integrity of the central nervous system in SBS children. The purpose  of this study was to investigate the neuropsychological status of school-aged SBS  children to determine if there were characteristic cognitive impairments that might  be amenable to early therapeutic intervention. METHODS: SBS children (n = 8; mean  age, 116.9 +/- 21 months) were compared with an age-matched cystic fibrosis (CF)  control group (n = 8; mean age, 118.1 +/- 14 months). Groups did not differ in age,  grade, or absences. Neuropsychological tests with established sensitivity to CNS  integrity compared performance over 6 cognitive domains. Emotional status also was  measured. Analyses were completed with 2-tailed t tests. RESULTS: Groups did not  differ on tests of intellectual ability and emotional function. Language, memory and  learning, and problem-solving testing results indicated no significant group  differences. However, the SBS group performed more poorly on measures assessing  visual-spatial ability, with P values ranging from .002 to .045. In a subset of  subjects, we noted significantly slower left-handed, but not right-handed,  performance on measures of finger dexterity and psychomotor speed. CONCLUSIONS:  Although emotional status did not differ from that of children with CF, SBS patients  showed visual-spatial deficits in the company of preserved language, attention and  memory, and executive skills. The specificity and consistency of these findings  suggests that right hemisphere CNS changes may occur in children with SBS. This  unexpected finding, coupled with the indication of left-sided psychomotor slowing in  right-handed subjects, raises the possibility that actual brain impairment, rather  than developmental delay accompanying slowed physical growth, accounts for these  findings. Longitudinal studies are needed to further clarify this issue. The  educational significance of the results is discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A combination of six neuropsychological and psychoeducational test variables produced statistically significant differences among the three groups. The instruments were sensitive to LD, MHI, and the differences between them. The students with LD performed poorly on linguistically oriented psychoeducational tests, whereas the students with MHI showed cognitive deficits in visual-spatial skills and in the areas of attention, memory, and novel problem solving. Differential interventions addressing these deficits appear to be indicated.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

By exploring object properties and relations among objects, infants develop visual-motor coordination, spatial skills, memory, language, cognition, and problem solving abilities. Such development and performance of activities of daily life (ADLs) rely heavily upon upper extremity function; and those with impaired reaching ability are at great risk for delays in these areas. While increasing user ADL independence, automated assistive devices may potentially increase the dose of interaction, which may enhance cognitive, social and motor development. Many actuator materials and devices are used to power automated assistive devices, however, in orthotics and prosthetics, the requirement for a “natural” look and feel, to make the artificial or assisted limb feel integrated with the body, is limited by current technology. Bulky, heavy, noisy electrical motors are typically used, which substantially reduce user compliance of powered orthoses. For greater acceptance of such devices, the desired requirements include: low weight, quiet operation, soft feel, and size and shape approximating that of a natural limb, with cost being an important factor. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) feature great promise in fulfilling these requirements. Nonetheless, so far only a few studies have attempted to explore rehabilitation applications, and at a very preliminary level. The overall goal of this dissertation is to develop a powered unilateral exoskeleton using a commercially available DEA that works as “artificial skeletal muscle”, and thereby, assess DEAs' capabilities and limitations to actuate rehabilitation robots. In Aim 1, by assessment of the state of soft actuators technology, Stacked Dielectric Elastomer was chosen to form an artificial skeletal muscle for actuating an upper extremity rehabilitation exoskeleton. This was accomplished through comparison of five novel groups of soft actuators: Coiled Nylon Fiber, Ethanol-Based Phase-Change, Poly Vinyl Chloride Gel, Stacked Dielectric Elastomer and Hydraulically Amplified Self-Healing Electrostatic. In Aim 2, the electro-mechanical properties of a commercially available CTsystems’ stacked DEA (CT-SDEA) were benchmarked. CT-SDEA observed properties were then compared with the reported values for mammalian skeletal muscle and performance metrics, such as its length-tension properties and force generation hysteresis were assessed. Thereby, an artificial skeletal muscle using multiple CT-SDEAs in series and parallel was configured. In Aim 3, the capability of adding proprioception to the configured artificial muscle was evaluated. This was done by measuring the length-dependent variation in capacitance of the CT-DEA, via a previously established length self-sensing technique. This length self-sensing technique then was added to an artificial muscle consisting of three CT-SDEAs in series. To mimic the muscle spindle’s function in mammalian skeletal muscle, the length modulation of the middle CT-SDEA was then sensed, while the artificial muscle was contracting. In Aim 4, the capability of the configured artificial muscle in actuation of a phantom upper extremity model’s elbow joint was assessed. Multiple artificial muscle configuration were tested to actuate the joint. The artificial muscle consisting a bundle of 3 myofibrils, each which containing five actuators in series, generated 22º of elbow flexion in the sagittal plane with 224 º/s angular velocity, under 1 N of tensile load. These results demonstrated CT-SDEAs’ potentials and limitations in rehabilitation applications. Using the benchmark testing results, appropriate assistive devices can be designed, which fit the capabilities of these versatile soft actuators. Further investigation is needed to assess CT-SDEAs capabilities in actuating joints with range of motion smaller than that of the elbow, such as ankle.

Although intelligence is not severely impaired, these patients are at increased risk of impairments in speech and language (including pragmatic skills), visual-spatial skills, executive functions, attention, and motor skills. Most patients achieve good psychosocial outcomes, although, by parent and teacher ratings, a substantial percentage is at increased risk. There might be sex differences and age-related changes in risk. Patients tend to rate their own behavior as similar to that of controls. Some data suggest that these patients have deficits in social cognition, specifically "theory of mind" skills. In terms of adaptive functioning, some children with congenital heart disease experience difficulties in activities of daily living, including maintaining adequate academic progress. Parents and others tend to rate the patients' quality-of-life less favorably than that of control populations, although the patients themselves often do not. A relatively neglected topic is the impact of a child with congenital heart disease on the well-being of parents and the family. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The extent to  which visual-spatial deficits are (1). associated with surgical and perioperative  variables, (2). attributable to visual-perceptual, motor control, or metacognitive  deficits, and (3). associated with adaptive difficulties at home or school was  evaluated. The subjects were 155 8-year-old children with D-transposition of the  great arteries who underwent the arterial switch operation before 3 months of age.  As part of a comprehensive evaluation, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) was  administered. ROCF copy productions were classified as having a Basal Organization  Level of 1 (low) or 2 or greater. A five-category clinical rating was also assigned.  More than half of the children in the cohort (52%) had copy productions scored at  Level 1, more than twice the expected frequency. The risk of having a low score was  not associated with vital organ support method or other surgical variables. On the  basis of comparisons of the relative fits of nested logistic regression models, poor  visual-perceptual abilities were more predictive of having a Level 1 score than  either motor control or metacognitive deficits. Children with poor copy production  scores had lower mathematics scores, but not lower reading scores or poorer parent  and teacher ratings of adaptive competence. The percentage of children receiving  remedial school services was associated with ROCF clinical rating, ranging from 58%  in the worst category to 8% in the best category. Visual-spatial deficits are common  among children after infant heart surgery and seem to reflect visual-perceptual  rather than motor control or metacognitive deficits. In addition, these deficits do  not seem to be clearly associated with the intraoperative methods or postoperative  events evaluated.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Environmental health perspectives	https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.9497	BACKGROUND: A concern persists that children's exposure to mercury vapor from dental amalgams produces neurotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to compare the  neuropsychological function of children, without prior exposure to dental amalgam,  whose caries were repaired using either dental amalgam or mercury-free composite  materials. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 534 6- to  10-year-old urban and rural children who were assessed yearly for 5 years using a  battery of tests of intelligence, achievement, language, memory, learning,  visual-spatial skills, verbal fluency, fine motor function, problem solving,  attention, and executive function. RESULTS: Although the mean urinary mercury  concentration was greater among children in the amalgam group than the composite  group (0.9 vs. 0.6 microg/g creatinine), few significant differences were found  between the test scores of children in the two groups. The differences found were  inconsistent in direction. Analyses using two cumulative exposure indices--surface  years of amalgam and urinary mercury concentration--produced similar results.  CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to elemental mercury in amalgam at the levels experienced by  the children who participated in the trial did not result in significant effects on  neuropsychological function within the 5-year follow-up period.

Cardiology in the young	https://doi.org/10.1017/S1047951114000031	BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the neuropsychological, behavioural, or structural brain imaging outcomes in adolescents who underwent corrective surgery in  infancy for tetralogy of Fallot. METHODS: In this single-centre cross-sectional  study, we enrolled 91 adolescents (13-16 years old) with tetralogy of Fallot and 87  referent subjects. Assessments included tests of academic achievement, memory,  executive functions, visual-spatial skills, attention, and social cognition, as well  as brain magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Genetic abnormalities or syndromes  were present in 25% of tetralogy of Fallot patients, who had markedly greater  neuropsychological morbidities than did patients without a syndrome. However, even  patients without a syndrome performed significantly worse than the referent group or  population norms in all of the neuropsychological domains assessed. In multivariable  regression in those without a genetic/phenotypic syndrome, the strongest predictors  of adverse late neurodevelopmental outcomes included a greater number of  complications at the first operation, more total surgical complications across all  operations, and occurrence of post-operative seizures. The presence of at least one  abnormality on structural magnetic resonance imaging was more frequent in tetralogy  of Fallot patients than the referent group (42% versus 8%). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents  with tetralogy of Fallot are at increased neurodevelopmental risk and would benefit  from ongoing surveillance and educational supports even after childhood.

The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-5223(03)00711-6	OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine which of the two major methods of vital organ support used in infant cardiac surgery, total circulatory arrest and low-flow  cardiopulmonary bypass, results in better neurodevelopmental outcomes at school age.  METHODS: In a single-center trial, infants with dextrotransposition of the great  arteries underwent the arterial switch operation after random assignment to either  total circulatory arrest or low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass. Developmental,  neurologic, and speech outcomes were assessed at 8 years of age in 155 of 160  eligible children (97%). RESULTS: Treatment groups did not differ in terms of most  outcomes, including neurologic status, Full-Scale or Performance IQ score, academic  achievement, memory, problem solving, and visual-motor integration. Children  assigned to total circulatory arrest performed worse on tests of motor function  including manual dexterity with the nondominant hand (P =.003), apraxia of speech (P  =.01), visual-motor tracking (P =.01), and phonologic awareness (P =.003).  Assignment to low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass was associated with a more impulsive  response style on a continuous performance test of vigilance (P <.01) and worse  behavior as rated by teachers (P =.05). Although mean scores on most outcomes were  within normal limits, neurodevelopmental status in the cohort as a whole was below  expectation in many respects, including academic achievement, fine motor function,  visual-spatial skills, working memory, hypothesis generating and testing, sustained  attention, and higher-order language skills. CONCLUSIONS: Use of total circulatory  arrest to support vital organs during heart surgery in infancy is generally  associated with greater functional deficits than is use of low-flow cardiopulmonary  bypass, although both strategies are associated with increased risk of  neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities.

Circulation	https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.026963	BACKGROUND: We report neuropsychological and structural brain imaging assessments in children 16 years of age with d-transposition of the great arteries who underwent  the arterial switch operation as infants. Children were randomly assigned to a vital  organ support method, deep hypothermia with either total circulatory arrest or  continuous low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS AND RESULTS: Of 159 eligible  adolescents, 139 (87%) participated. Academic achievement, memory, executive  functions, visual-spatial skills, attention, and social cognition were assessed. Few  significant treatment group differences were found. The occurrence of seizures in  the postoperative period was the medical variable most consistently related to worse  outcomes. The scores of both treatment groups tended to be lower than those of the  test normative populations, with substantial proportions scoring ≥1 SDs below the  expected mean. Although the test scores of most adolescents in this trial cohort are  in the average range, a substantial proportion have received remedial academic or  behavioral services (65%). Magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities were more  frequent in the d-transposition of the great arteries group (33%) than in a referent  group (4%). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with d-transposition of the great arteries who  have undergone the arterial switch operation are at increased neurodevelopmental  risk. These data suggest that children with congenital heart disease may benefit  from ongoing surveillance to identify emerging difficulties.

The Magic Carpet (MC) is a novel navigation test derived from the Walking Corsi Test and the manual Corsi Block-tapping Task (CBT). The MC requires mental rotations and executive function. In Cerebral Palsy (CP), CBT, and MC scores relate differently to clinical and lesional factors. Hypotheses of this study are: that frontal lesion specifically affect navigation in CP; that brain lesions affect MC cognitive strategies. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two children with spastic CP, aged 5 to 14 years, 14 with a unilateral and 8 with a bilateral form, underwent the CBT and the MC. Errors were classified into seven patterns by a recently described algorithm. Brain lesions were quantified according to a novel semi-quantitative MRI scale. Control data were partially drawn from a previous study on 91 typically developing children. Results: Children with CP performed worse than controls on both tests. Right hemispheric impairment correlated with spatial memory. MC span was reduced less than CBT span and was more selectively related to right middle white-matter and frontal lesions. Error patterns were differently distributed in CP and in typical development, and depended on right brain impairment: children with more extensive right lesions made more positional than sequential errors. Discussion: In CP, navigation is affected especially by extensive lesions involving the right frontal lobe. In addition, these are associated with abnormal cognitive strategies. Whereas in typical development positional errors, preserving serial order, increase with age and performance, in CP they are associated with poorer performance and more extensive right-brain lesions. The explanation may lie in lesion side: right brain is crucial for mental rotations, necessary for spatial updating. Left-lateralized spatial memory strategies, relying on serial order, are not efficient if not accompanied by right-brain spatial functions. © 2015.

Hormones and Behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.04.002	There is considerable interest in the organizational effects of pubertal sex hormones on human sex-related characteristics. Recent evidence from rodents suggests that there is a decreasing window of sensitivity to sex hormones throughout adolescence. If adolescence also represents a period of brain organization in human beings, then the timing of exposure to sex-typical hormones at puberty should have long-term effects on sex-typed characteristics: individuals with early timing should be more sex-typed than individuals with late timing. We tested this hypothesis in 320 young adults by relating their pubertal timing (retrospective comparison to peers) to cognitive abilities that show sex differences. Results provide partial support for the hypothesis. For men, pubertal timing was inversely related to scores on a test of three-dimensional mental rotations. Effects do not appear to be due to duration of hormone exposure (time since puberty), but other potential influences need further study. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Circuits Syst. Conf., BioCAS - Proc.	https://doi.org/10.1109/BIOCAS.2017.8325128	Research suggests that vision plays an important role in child's growth for building cognitive abilities necessary to process spatial information. Consequently, blindness in children affects the development of their spatial abilities. Here we present ABBI (Audio Bracelet for Blind Interaction), a wearable device that was developed to rehabilitate underdeveloped skills in visually impaired children. The core idea behind ABBI is to use the auditory modality to convey spatial information about the movement of the person's own body within the personal, peri-personal and extra-personal space. Specifically, it provides sources of sounds positioned on the main effectors/limbs (such as the wrists and feet) of persons with visual deficits. The ABBI system is composed of a small wearable custom-designed device with integrated audio system, motion sensors, and a Bluetooth low energy module to communicate with a smartphone. We discuss the importance of this device in terms of innovation, usability and highlight future studies aimed at rehabilitating the brain processes and functions involved in spatial cognition of children with visual disabilities through natural audio-motor associations. © 2017 IEEE.

This set of studies investigated how a large group of children’s vocational interests developed over a two year period, and how their interests for activities/occupations were related to selected abilities (Mechanical, Spatial Rotation and Logical Reasoning). Published research has consistently demonstrated that for adults, vocational interests are stable over time, and that interests typically fall into six main categories; Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising and Conventional (Holland, 1959). Furthermore, there is a wealth of evidence to suggest that the relationships between these six categories broadly approximate a hexagonal framework once individuals reach adulthood (e.g. Holland et al., 1969). Data analysis revealed that similar to adults, children’s interests overall were remarkably stable over time, and that this was particularly the case for Realistic and Social interests. The findings were also suggestive of a pathway of interest development in children aged 11-17. The youngest children who participated in this research had interests that were often gender stereotyped, though the structure of their interests was not consistent with the hexagonal structure commonly seen in adults. However, as children got older, their interests became more aligned to a hexagonal format, particularly for the female group. Furthermore, there were clear gender differences with females typically having more distinctive and more consistent interest profiles over time. There were a few weak associations between ability and interest, with the clearest link suggesting that early Realistic interests are predictive (in part) of later Mechanical ability. These findings consequently have practical implications for the timing and delivery of careers counselling in school. Theoretical implications and future directions have also been identified and discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The most important sensitive period has been considered to be prenatal, but there is increasing attention to puberty as another organizational period, with the possibility of decreasing sensitivity to sex hormones across the pubertal transition. In this paper, we review evidence that sex hormones present during the prenatal and pubertal periods produce permanent changes to behavior. There is good evidence that exposure to high levels of androgens during prenatal development results in masculinization of activity and occupational interests, sexual orientation, and some spatial abilities; prenatal androgens have a smaller effect on gender identity, and there is insufficient information about androgen effects on sex-linked behavior problems. There is little good evidence regarding long-lasting behavioral effects of pubertal hormones, but there is some suggestion that they influence gender identity and perhaps some sex-linked forms of psychopathology, and there are many opportunities to study this issue. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we focus on psychological outcomes likely to be influenced by processes of physical sexual differentiation that may be atypical in DSD, particularly characteristics related to being male or female (those that show sex differences in the general population, gender identity, and sexuality). We review evidence suggesting that (a) early androgens facilitate several aspects of male-typed behavior, with large effects on activity interests, and moderate effects on some social and personal behaviors (including sexual orientation) and spatial ability; (b) gender dysphoria and gender change occur more frequently in individuals with DSD than in the general population, with rates varying in relation to syndrome, initial gender assignment, and medical treatment; and (c) sexual behavior may be affected by DSD through several paths related to the condition and treatment, including reduced fertility, physical problems associated with genital ambiguity, social stigmatization, and hormonal variations. We also consider limitations to current work and challenges to studying gender and sexuality in DSD. We conclude with suggestions for a research agenda and a proposed research framework.

Current opinion in behavioral sciences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.11.011	Many important psychological characteristics show sex differences, and are influenced by sex hormones at different developmental periods. We focus on the role  of sex hormones in early development, particularly the differential effects of  prenatal androgens on aspects of gender development. Increasing evidence confirms  that prenatal androgens have facilitative effects on male-typed activity interests  and engagement (including child toy preferences and adult careers), and spatial  abilities, but relatively minimal effects on gender identity. Recent emphasis has  been directed to the psychological mechanisms underlying these effects (including  sex differences in propulsive movement, and androgen effects on interest in people  versus things), and neural substrates of androgen effects (including regional brain  volumes, and neural responses to mental rotation, sexually arousing stimuli,  emotion, and reward). Ongoing and planned work is focused on understanding the ways  in which hormones act jointly with the social environment across time to produce  varying trajectories of gender development, and clarifying mechanisms by which  androgens affect behaviors. Such work will be facilitated by applying lessons from  other species, and by expanding methodology. Understanding hormonal influences on  gender development enhances knowledge of psychological development generally, and  has important implications for basic and applied questions, including sex  differences in psychopathology, women's underrepresentation in science and math, and  clinical care of individuals with variations in gender expression.

Korman; Beltz, Adriene M.	2012	journalArticle	Early androgen effects on spatial and mechanical abilities: Evidence from congenital adrenal hyperplasia.	Behavioral Neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.1037/a0026652	There is considerable controversy about the origins of sex differences in cognitive abilities, particularly the male superiority in spatial abilities. We studied effects of early androgens on spatial and mechanical abilities in adolescents and young adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). On tests of three-dimensional mental rotations, geography, and mechanical knowledge, females with CAH scored higher than their unaffected sisters, and males with CAH scored lower than their unaffected brothers. Exploratory regression analyses suggest that androgens affect spatial ability in females directly and through male-typed activity interests. Findings indicate that early androgens influence spatial and mechanical abilities, and that androgen effects on abilities may occur in part through effects on sex-typed activity interests.

The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relative contributions of processing speed, short-term memory, working memory, and reading to arithmetic calculation in children. Results suggested four important findings. First, processing speed emerged as a significant contributor of arithmetic calculation only in relation to age-related differences in the general sample. Second, processing speed and short-term memory did not eliminate the contribution of working memory to arithmetic calculation. Third, individual working memory components-verbal working memory and visual-spatial working memory-each contributed unique variance to arithmetic calculation in the presence of all other variables. Fourth, a full model indicated that chronological age remained a significant contributor to arithmetic calculation in the presence of significant contributions from all other variables. Results are discussed in terms of directions for future research on working memory in arithmetic calculation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Using a maximum-likelihood estimation procedure. the significance of genetic influence, passive genotype-environment correlation, parental influence on the child's environment, assortative mating, and selective placement was assessed. As predicted, the parameter estimate for genetic influence (a function of the heritabilities of the character during early childhood and adulthood and their genetic correlation) is significant for general cognitive ability at both 3 and 4. Moreover, estimates of the genetic parameter are significant for spatial ability at both 3 and 4 years of age, for verbal ability at 3, and for perceptual speed at 4. Thus, there is at least some continuity between early childhood and adulthood as well as some genetic differentiation for specif cognitive abilities. © 1988.

Psychoneuroendocrinology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.01.009	The aim of this study was to investigate the association between estrogen and spatial ability tasks in women suffering from schizophrenia. For this purpose, a  placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-time cross-over study using 17beta-estradiol  combined with norethisterone acetate for replacement therapy and as an adjunct to a  naturalistic maintenance antipsychotic treatment was carried out over a period of 8  months. Nineteen women (mean age=38.0 years, SD=9.9 years) with schizophrenia  hospitalized for the first time or repeatedly were included in the study. Sex  hormones - 17beta-estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone  (FSH), prolactin, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate - were measured  and the patients completed a neuropsychological test in the last two active drug  and/or placebo phases. Three different spatial ability tasks - spatial orientation,  spatial visualization, and flexibility of closure - were measured by a  paper-and-pencil test. No association between estrogen and spatial ability was  found; however, in an additional exploratory data analysis, high levels of  testosterone, LH, and FSH correlated significantly with performance in the  flexibility of closure task. This is the very first study, based on estrogen  intervention instead of physiological hormone changes, to examine the association  between estrogen and spatial ability in women with schizophrenia.

We compared the effects of two spaced restudy interventions: A Diagram-Based Restudy (DBR) warm-up condition and a business-as-usual Text-Based Restudy (TBR) warm-up condition. Sample: One hundred and twenty-eight consented high school students in 15 classes. Methods: Students completed daily warm-ups over a 4-week period. Students were randomly assigned to conditions within classrooms. Warm-ups were independently completed at the start of class meetings and consisted of questions about content covered 1-10 days prior to each warm-up. Students received feedback on their answers each week. A series of ANOVAs and ANCOVAs was conducted. Results and Conclusions: Results showed equal and significant growth from pre- to post-test for both conditions (d = .31-67) on three outcomes: Biology knowledge, biology diagram comprehension (near transfer), and geology diagram comprehension (far transfer). ANCOVA results suggested that the magnitude of this increase was linked to the number of questions attempted during the intervention. For the DBR condition only, there were interactions with content knowledge on diagram comprehension gain scores and interactions with spatial scores on biology knowledge gain scores. Students with lower biology knowledge and lower Paper Folding Test scores were disadvantaged in the DBR condition, whereas the TBR condition was equitable across all levels of knowledge and spatial ability. © 2014 The British Psychological Society.

Very premature birth impairs both visual–spatial abilities and cortico-thalamic structural connectivity. We hypothesized that impaired structural DAN-pulvinar connectivity mediates the effect of very premature birth on adult visual–spatial abilities. Seventy very premature (median age 26.6 years) and 57 mature born adults (median age 26.6 years) were assessed with cognitive tests and diffusion tensor imaging. Perceptual organization (PO) index of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III was used as a proxy for visual–spatial abilities, and connection probability maps in the thalamus, derived from probabilistic tractography from the DAN, were used as a proxy for DAN-thalamic connectivity. Premature born adults showed decreases in both PO-index and connection probability from DAN into the pulvinar, with both changes being positively correlated. Moreover, path analysis revealed that DAN-pulvinar connectivity mediates the relationship between very premature birth and PO-index. Results provide evidence for long-term effects of very premature birth on structural DAN-pulvinar connectivity, mediating the effect of prematurity on adult visual–spatial impairments. Data suggest DAN-pulvinar connectivity as a specific target of prognostic and diagnostic procedures for visual–spatial abilities after premature birth. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It has been postulated that listening to classical music enhances performance on spatial tasks (Rauscher, Shaw & Ky, 1993). A review of the literature demonstrates that these two constructs are mediated by the same areas of the brain and share similar processing. The specific area of interest for this study is the extent of this relationship in individuals who are able to play a musical instrument.    The participants were children between the ages of 6 and 12 who had been receiving music instruction on the piano for at least one year, and had been to the national piano auditions held by the Guild Organization during the summer of 1999. All participants were administered a measure of spatial ability, the Arrows subtest from the NEPSY, as well as the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, which yielded a Performance and Verbal IQ.    Results did not demonstrate a significant relationship between musicality, as measured by the guild ratings, and any of the cognitive measures. Further analysis of the data demonstrated that there may have been confounding variables such as gender and the dependent measure utilized. The implications of these findings are discussed.

Two- and three-year-olds reason about unseen events	Developmental Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.36.3.394	Children 2, 2½, and 3 years of age engaged in a search task in which they opened 1 of 4 doors in an occluder to retrieve a ball that had been rolled behind the occluder. The correct door was determined by a partially visible wall placed behind the occluder that stopped the motion of the unseen ball. Only the oldest group of children was able to reliably choose the correct door. All children were able to retrieve a toy that had been hidden in the same apparatus if the toy was hidden from the front by opening a door. Analysis of the younger children's errors indicated that they did not search randomly but instead used a variety of strategies. The results are consistent with the Piagetian view that the ability to use representations to guide action develops slowly over the first years of life.

On some trials, the infant observed the experimenter place a barrier on the ball's track; the barrier remained partially visible above the occluder throughout the remainder of the trial. When the task involved only predictive tracking, infants' anticipatory gaze shifts were faster when no barrier was present. When the task involved both tracking and reaching, there were more reaches when no barrier was present. If the infant reached, the timing and extension of the reach and the accompanying gaze shift did not differ with regard to the barrier. Because catching the ball was quite difficult for these infants, task demands interfered with the integration of visual information and visuospatial reasoning about the barrier with the reaching action.

However, with continued practice on particular stimuli, rotation time, though still dependent on angle of rotation, became independent of the complexity of those stimuli for most subjects. Subjects may represent a stimulus and imagine its rotation piece by piece, if it is unfamiliar, and as a whole, if (as, presumably, in the experiments by Cooper & Podgorny, 1976) it is sufficiently well learned. However, for a few subjects, who reported using a more analytic, verbally supported strategy throughout, the effects of stimulus complexity were only partially reduced by continuing practice.

It is argued that ordered sets of descriptions constructed from critical features form the basis for perceiving, remembering, and transforming these displays. Children solving a rotation problem chose their response from a set of four alternatives designed to indicate specific errors. The studies examined the hypotheses that codability and not extent of distance determines difficulty, that critical features and not whole objects are coded, and that implicit perceptual axes provide a frame of reference for coding the display. Results across the three studies supported these hypotheses. These results are discussed in terms of a description of spatial representation in which relational propositional statements are assigned to displays. © 1989.

In this work, we proposed navigation tasks in immersive virtual reality (IVR) to 15 children with CP and 13 typically developing (TD) peers in order to assess the individual navigation strategies and their modifiability in a situation resembling real life. Methods: We developed and adapted to IVR an application based on a 5-way maze in a playground that was to be navigated to find a reward. The learning process, navigation strategies, and adaptation to changes were compared between participants with CP and their TD peers and correlated with visual-spatial abilities and cognitive competences. Results: Most participants with CP needed more attempts than TD participants to become proficient in navigation. Furthermore, the learning phase was correlated to visual-spatial memory but not with cognitive competences. Interestingly, navigation skills were comparable between groups after stabilization. While TD participants mainly relied on allocentric strategies based on environmental cues, egocentric (self-centered) strategies based on body motion prevailed in participants with CP. Furthermore, participants with CP had more difficulties in modifying their navigation strategies, caused by difficulties in executive processes beyond the visual-perceptual impairment, with an inefficient shift between implicit and explicit competences. Conclusions: The navigation abilities in participants with CP seem to be different from their TD peers in terms of learning and adaptation to new conditions; this could deeply affect their everyday life and ultimately participation and inclusion. A regular assessing and focused rehabilitative plans could help to better navigate the environment and affect self-perception. © Copyright © 2020 Biffi, Gagliardi, Maghini, Genova, Panzeri, Redaelli and Turconi.

One of the reasons is that most of the studies investigated only one factor (e.g., intelligence), neglecting other factors relevant for the acquisition of chess skill (e.g., amount of practice, years of experience). The present study investigated the chess skill of 57 young chess players using measures of intelligence (WISC III), practice, and experience. Although practice had the most influence on chess skill, intelligence explained some variance even after the inclusion of practice. When an elite subsample of 23 children was tested, it turned out that intelligence was not a significant factor in chess skill, and that, if anything, it tended to correlate negatively with chess skill. This unexpected result is explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample. The study demonstrates the dangers of focusing on a single factor in complex real-world situations where a number of closely interconnected factors operate. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Intellectual and visual neurological prognosis in series of 77 cases of non-tumor hydrocephalus].	Archives francaises de pediatrie		We report the neurological, intellectual and visual outcome of 77 children with hydrocephalus of non tumoral origin. Neurological deficits and epilepsy were common,  particularly in those with severe intellectual deficit and with acquired brain  damages. Intellectual level prognosis was usually good, although lower than in a  healthy population: 75% of children had full intellectual quotient (FIQ) higher than  70 but often, there was an heterogeneous pattern of the IQ with greater differences  between verbal and performance results because of poor visual-spatial skills.  Attention and syntax comprehension of language disabilities were also specifically  encountered. Meningitis or toxoplasmosis secondary to hydrocephalus often resulted  in a poor intelligence level but other causes did not influence intelligence level  or pattern. Visual-spatial deficits, attention disorders and language disabilities  did not seem related to the degree of hydrocephalus or the delay before shunting,  but were especially encountered when ventricular dilatation persisted in spite of  the operation. Functional amblyopias were frequent, certainly related to strabismus.  Optic atrophy was rare and linked to direct compression of the optic nerves or to  major and repeated episodes of intracranial hypertension.

Neuropsychologia	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.07.008	Visual-spatial impairment and neuroanatomical abnormalities are considered hallmark features of neurofibromatosis, type I (NF-I). Numerous studies have demonstrated  visual-spatial deficits in children with NF-I, but few relations between these  deficits and neuroanatomical abnormalities have been identified. We compared the  functional neuroanatomy of cerebral regions involved in the spatial transformation  of alphanumeric stimuli in individuals with NF-I and healthy control participants  using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Given the prevalence of visual  pathway abnormalities and visual-spatial deficits in NF-I, we hypothesized that less  neuronal hemodynamic activity would be found in occipital and parietal cortices in  this group compared with controls. However, NF-I participants relied to a greater  degree than controls on posterior cortex (including occipital, parietal, and middle  temporal cortices) relative to lateral and inferior frontal regions during  visual-spatial analysis. This pattern was significantly related to their behavioral  performance on the fMRI task, which in turn was also positively correlated with  reading scores. These findings support evidence of frontal cortical anomalies in  NF-I and may provide a pathophysiological basis for cognitive deficits in NF-I.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This paper aims to reveal spatial transformations carried out through the time spent at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative study is carried out based on Garfinkel’s (1961) ethnomethodology method (documentary method of interpretation). Analysis focused on the first month of pandemic in which urgent adaptations and solutions produced at home, and the situation in last two weeks of pandemic is analyzed within a control group and comparisons were made. Perec’s (1974) statement of “a user's manual” is used as a checklist of time-space-activity observations proposed on “mondayness, tuesdayness, wednesdayness, thursdayness, fridayness, saturdayness and sundayness.” Instead of daily period, activities performed on a weekly scale were recorded and time-dependent shifts of functions were revealed. Findings: Findings introduced new discussion topics to examine dwelling spaces in “new normal.” Comparisons indicate that hypothesis of gathering all activities in room in terms of “life fits into room” concept is directed through rapid spatial behaviors in daily life as primary adaptation. Research limitations/implications: Although pandemic process continues after study, analysis of first four weeks are accepted as the period of rapid change and compared by last two weeks of pandemic. Originality/value: Pandemic indicators proposed in study brings along that there is little information on the subject in literature. Socio-spatial findings address the examinations of spatial transformations into pandemic adaptation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	2	2	0	0	1

There are significant advantages to be gained by integrating different scientific paradigms, but there are also significant challenges. Cross-paradigm differences in levels of analysis, nomenclature, and expectations of training outcomes complicate interpretation of training results.

In the current paper, we assessed the relation between basal cortisol levels and learning using a virtual navigation task in children. We show that basal cortisol level has a differential effect on learning and memory between children using spatial and response navigation strategies. Specifically, cortisol was found to be beneficial for learning performance in children using spatial strategies, such that higher levels of cortisol were associated with more efficient learning in a virtual maze. In contrast, cortisol had a deleterious effect on learning the virtual maze in children using response strategies, such that higher cortisol levels were associated with increased spatial working memory errors. Based on these results, individual differences in navigation strategy could help explain contradictory results in the literature showing that cortisol can have either a positive or negative association with learning and memory performance. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We present a patient who had cleft palate among other congenital manifestations. This patient's immediate postnatal period clinically seemed to have a Pierre Robin sequence. With the development of the craniofacial complex, microgenia and micrognathia with glossoptosis gradually became apparent. On further assessment, the patient showed other clinical findings that suggested a syndromic association. This required a complete evaluation to discard other conditions that present with low psychomotor development and distinctive facies, such as Kabuki syndrome or fetal alcohol syndrome. The diagnosis for Williams' syndrome was established based on the clinical features and supported by the fluorescent in situ hybridization test. Williams' syndrome has been described as a rare, congenital disorder characterized by physical and developmental problems. Common features include characteristic "elfin-like" facies, supravalvular aortic stenosis, hypercalcemia, low birth weight, slow weight gain, feeding problems, impulsive and outgoing personality, limited spatial skills and motor control, and intellectual disability. Although individuals with Williams' syndrome may show competence in areas such as language, music, and interpersonal relations, their IQs are usually low and they are considered moderately to mildly retarded.

Neuroendocrinology	https://doi.org/10.1159/000151397	BACKGROUND: The ability to detect the spatial characteristics of objects and to rotate them mentally is frequently impaired in early treated congenital  hypothyroidism (CH) children. AIMS: To explore the neural substrate of the  visuospatial difficulty in children with CH, we studied 15 children with CH (8-10  years) and 13 age-matched control children with functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) using a mental rotation task (VST). RESULTS: Performance at VST was  significantly different between the two groups. Moreover, fMRI data showed greater  activation in the superior parietal cortex in control children while children with  CH had greater activation in the bilateral SMA and the opercular region of the  precentral gyrus, the adjacent insula and the left somatosensory parietal cortex.  Furthermore, children with CH deactivated the inferior parietal cortex (Brodmann  area 40) more than controls. CONCLUSION: We suggest that the poorer performance of  children with CH on VST task is related to the decreased activation in brain areas  important for the mental representation of the objects' spatial characteristics,  with increased recruitment of regions involved in the representation of  somatosensory whole-body information. More studies will be necessary to understand  if this different effectiveness in VST reflects immaturity of the neural system or  its actual impairment.

However, the limitations of human working memory create serious constraints for software and hardware designers and developers. Working memory capacity differs across individuals and shows growth through early childhood and decline in many older adults. However, recent research has shown that working memory is trainable and can improve problems such as attentional deficit disorder and cognitive problems in aging. The current work describes the development and preliminary validation of SPOT; the Spatial Perception Orientation Task. Spatial working memory is particularly important to spatial cognition, including mental rotation and spatial visualization. It is also important to understanding navigation in complex game worlds. After validation is complete, HCI practitioners will find SPOT easy to use, and available on-line. It will also be usable for different age groups and for those with color deficiencies.

The connection between spatial skills and success in mathematics performance has long been established in the literature. This study examined the distinction between visual-spatial "schematic" representations that encode the spatial relations described in a problem versus visual-spatial "pictorial" representations that encode only the visual appearance of the objects described in a problem. A total of 305 hearing (n = 156) and deaf (n = 149) participants from middle school, high school, and college participated in this study. At all educational levels, the hearing students performed significantly better in solving the mathematical problems compared to their deaf peers. Although the deaf baccalaureate students exhibited the highest performance of all the deaf participants, they only performed as well as the hearing middle school students who were the lowest scoring hearing group. Deaf students remained flat in their performance on the mathematical problem-solving task from middle school through the college associate degree level. The analysis of the students' problem representations showed that the hearing participants utilized visual-spatial schematic representation to a greater extent than did the deaf participants. However, the use of visual-spatial schematic representations was a stronger positive predictor of mathematical problem-solving performance for the deaf students. When deaf students' problem representation focused simply on the visual-spatial pictorial or iconic aspects of the mathematical problems, there was a negative predictive relationship with their problem-solving performance. On two measures of visual-spatial abilities, the hearing students in high school and college performed significantly better than their deaf peers. © The Author 2007.

All participants received training  for 36 sessions, three days per week, for 12 weeks. PRIMARY MEASURES: Measures were  recorded at baseline, after the intervention and at a six-month follow-up. Primary  measurements included the Trail Making Part B, Stroop, forward digit span, and  mental rotation tests. RESULTS: A total of 179 participants (79.56% response rate)  completed the study. Cognitive performances on all four tasks in the combined  training group improved significantly after the intervention ( P < 0.01). Changes in  cognitive performance were greater in the combined intervention group than those in  the physical exercise group (e.g. forward digit span, 13.61% vs. 2.18%, P = 0.003),  the cognitive training group (e.g. mental rotation, 17.36% vs. 0.87%, P  = 0.002),  and the control group (e.g. Stroop, -4.11% vs. -0.72%, P  = 0.026). CONCLUSION: The  combined intervention produced greater benefits on cognitive function compared to  either training alone in stroke survivors with vascular cognitive impairment.

database	Boakes, Norma J.	2006	thesis	The effects of origami lessons on students' spatial visualization skills and achievement levels in a seventh -grade mathematics classroom		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-origami-lessons-on-students-spatial/docview/304985255/se-2?accountid=11531	Spatial ability is recognized as an important skill in a child's mathematical repertoire (NCTM, 2000). With the potential impact this skill can have on a child's mathematical achievement level (Smith, 1964), researchers have sought to improve the spatial skills of children through training.    The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of spatial-based training to improve students' spatial abilities through the use of Origami-mathematics lessons. Origami, though a commonly used instructional tool recognized for its connection to spatial ability and mathematics (Cornelius & Tubis, 2003; Franco, 1999; Pearl, 1994; Tubis; 2004a), has yet to be utilized in research as a method for improving children's spatial skills. To determine Origami-mathematics lessons impact on spatial ability, twelve Origami lessons were designed and infused within a month-long geometry unit of a mathematics course. Using a group of seventh-grade students, one set of students received traditional instruction while the other set of students received traditional instruction in addition to a collection of Origami lessons. Mathematics achievement and spatial abilities, specifically visualization, were assessed by means of pre- and post-tests administered prior to the start of the geometry unit and at the conclusion of the unit. A 2 (group) x 2 (gender) factorial design was then used to analyze data gathered.    Analyses of Covariance were calculated for each of the three spatial tests and the mathematics achievement tests. For spatial abilities, a significant interaction was found between group and gender for the Card Rotation Test with males that received treatment showing increased gains while females of the same group showed a decrease in their spatial skills. The Paper Folding Test results only approached significance for the interaction of group and gender. The Surface Development Test and Mathematics Achievement Test revealed no significant interactions of group and gender or by group or gender independently. Though results were inconsistent, Origami-mathematics lessons blended within traditional instruction were shown to be as beneficial as traditional instruction in terms of mathematics achievement. In addition, spatial skills could be affected through Origami training though future studies must take into consideration the gender and spatial test differences that were found.

Frontiers in neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2017.00574	Unlike for other abilities, children do not receive systematic spatial orientation training at school, even though navigational training during adulthood improves  spatial skills. We investigated whether navigational training programme (NTP)  improved spatial orientation skills in pre-schoolers. We administered 12-week NTP to  seventeen 4- to 5-year-old children (training group, TG). The TG children and 17  age-matched children (control group, CG) who underwent standard didactics were  tested twice before (T(0)) and after (T(1)) the NTP using tasks that tap into  landmark, route and survey representations. We determined that the TG participants  significantly improved their performances in the most demanding navigational task,  which is the task that taps into survey representation. This improvement was  significantly higher than that observed in the CG, suggesting that NTP fostered the  acquisition of survey representation. Such representation is typically achieved by  age seven. This finding suggests that NTP improves performance on higher-level  navigational tasks in pre-schoolers.

Infancy	https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0104_3	Event Set × Event Set designs were used to study the rotating screen paradigm introduced by Baillargeon, Spelke, and Wasserman (1985). In Experiment 1, 36 5 1/2-month-old infants were habituated to a screen rotating 180° with no block, a screen rotating 120° up to a block, or a screen rotating 180° up to and seemingly through a block. All infants were then tested on the same 3 events and also a screen rotating 120° with no block. The results indicate that infants are using novelty and familiarity preference to determine their looking times. To confirm this, in Experiment 2, 52 5 1/2-month-old infants were familiarized on either 3 or 7 trials to a screen rotating 180° with no block or a screen rotating 120° with no block. All infants were then tested on the same test events as in Experiment 1. Infants with fewer familiarization trials were more likely to prefer the familiar rotation event. The results of these 2 experiments indicate that infants did not use the possibility or impossibility of events but instead used familiarity or novelty relations between the habituation events and the test events to determine their looking times, and suggest that the Baillargeon et al. study should not be interpreted as indicating object permanence or solidity knowledge in young infants.

Extrinsically motivated Ss were predicted to exhibit performance decrement following a failure experience, whereas the opposite was predicted for intrinsically motivated Ss. Success feedback was predicted to enhance subsequent performance only for the intrinsic group. Following success, failure, or no feedback on an activity reflecting spatial skills (an incomplete picture task), Ss' performance on an activity tapping different skills (i.e., anagrams) provided by a 2nd experimenter served as the primary measure of helplessness. Ss' intrinsic motivation in performing the incomplete picture task, a similar task (embedded figures) and a dissimilar task (dots-to-dots) was also examined. Results support the predictions on both performance and intrinsic motivation measures.

The Journal of general psychology	https://doi.org/10.1080/00221309.1991.9917793	The visual-spatial memory ability of 25 Zairian elementary school children was compared with that of 23 Scottish children, using a variation of Kearins's (1976)  object placement task. The Scottish children demonstrated significantly better  visual-spatial memory than the Zairian children when the easiest (small household  objects) of three arrays was presented. The Scottish and Zairian children  demonstrated a similar level of visual-spatial ability when the other two arrays  (geometric shapes and a variety of natural pieces of wood) were presented, and there  were no significant gender differences. Although the Australian Aboriginal  children's performance on the visual-spatial task in Drinkwater's (1976) study was  superior to the White children's performance (Kearins, 1976, 1981), the Zairian  children's performance in this study was not. Perhaps the Aboriginal groups, over  countless generations navigating the trackless desert of western Australia, were  forced by their environment to develop an aptitude for direction finding that  Zairians (whose ecological situation more closely resembles that of Europeans) have  not.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1980.tb02597.x	The hypothesis that a major X-linked gene determines spatial ability in man has been cited as an explanation for the adult sex difference in spatial ability. Here the relevant literature is critically reviewed. Early studies often used multiple comparisons, yet repeatedly failed to find significant differences. In some cases the results flatly contradicted the hypothesis, and those results that were consistent with it can be accounted for by chance expectancies. Recent evidence comes from studies that are methodologically superior to the early work; yet these studies provide no support for the X-linkage of spatial ability. It is concluded that belief in the validity of the hypothesis is unfounded.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	not acessible but still seems irrelevant	2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

ACM Multimed. Conf.	https://doi.org/10.1145/3240508.3240692	Drawing is an important part of elementary school education, especially since it contributes to the development of spatial skills. Virtual reality enables us to draw not just on a flat 2D surface, but in 3D space. Our research aims at showing if and how this form of 3D drawing can be beneficial for art education. This paper presents first insights into potential benefits and obstacles when introducing 3D drawing at elementary schools. In an experiment with 18 children, we studied practical aspects, proficiency, and spatial ability development. Our results show improvement in the children's 3D drawing skills but not in their spatial abilities. Their drawing skills also do seem to be correlated with their mental rotation ability, although further research is needed to conclusively confirm this. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

Therefore, this ability appears to be fundamental for the correct development of the capacity to integrate different spatial reference frames. The spatial reference frame seems to be present in all the sensory modalities. However, it has been demonstrated that different sensory modalities follow various developmental courses. Nevertheless, to date these courses have been investigated only in people with sensory impairments, where there is a possible bias due to compensatory strategies and it is complicated to assess the exact age when these skills emerge. For these reasons, we investigated the development of the allocentric frame in the auditory domain in a group of typically developing children aged 6–10 years. To do so, we used an auditory Simon task, a paradigm that involves implicit spatial processing, and we asked children to perform the task in both the uncrossed and crossed hands postures. We demonstrated that the crossed hands posture affected the performance only in younger children (6–7 years), whereas at 10 years of age children performed as adults and were not affected by such posture. Moreover, we found that this task's performance correlated with age and developmental differences in spatial abilities. Our results support the hypothesis that auditory spatial cognition's developmental course is similar to the visual modality development as reported in the literature. © 2021 The Authors	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Some of these skills, working memory, mental rotation, problem solving, are linked to higher performance in science, technology, math, and engineering (STEM) disciplines. In the present study, we examined whether experience in a different activity, hip hop dance, is also linked to cognitive abilities connected with STEM skills as well as social cognition ability. Dancers who varied in hip hop and other dance style experience were presented with a set of computerized tasks that assessed working memory capacity, mental rotation speed, problem solving efficiency, and theory of mind. We found that, when controlling for demographic factors and other dance style experience, those with greater hip hop dance experience were faster at mentally rotating images of hands at greater angle disparities and there was a trend for greater accuracy at identifying positive emotions displayed by cropped images of human faces. We suggest that hip hop dance, similar to other more technical activities such as video gameplay, tap some specific cognitive abilities that underlie STEM skills. Furthermore, we suggest that hip hop dance experience can be used to reach populations who may not otherwise be interested in other kinesthetic or gaming activities and potentially enhance select sociocognitive skills. © 2017 Bonny et al.

Research with college students suggests that individual differences in adults' ability to approximate cumulative surface area are reflected in their knowledge of school-relevant geometry. Other research suggests that the link between analog magnitude representations and mathematical reasoning may be present earlier in development, at least for representations of numerical magnitude and arithmetic concepts. Here we asked whether the understanding of basic geometric concepts and transformations, such as parallelism and mental rotation, makes similar psychological connections to spatial magnitude, particularly representations of area, prior to extensive education with geometry. We found that the precision with which 4- to 6-year-olds approximate area for irregular 2D shapes positively correlated with their performance on a basic geometry test, even when controlling for age and verbal intelligence. This finding points to a previously undocumented relationship between a system for representing analog magnitude and geometric competence. The potential interactions with systems of object recognition and navigation are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

We revealed that compared to students who did not make a visual representation, those who produced an accurate visual-schematic representation increased the chance of solving a word problem correctly almost six times. Inaccurate visual-schematic and pictorial representations, on the other hand, decreased students' chance of problem solving success. Noteworthy, reading comprehension was related to word problem solving at the test-level but not at the item-level. In interpreting the results, we advocate the use of item-level analyses since they are able to disclose such level-of-analysis discrepancies. © 2014.

Developmental neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1207/S15326942DN1802_1	The development of neurocognitive networks was examined in 2 cognitive paradigms: auditory sentence comprehension and mental rotation of alphanumeric stimuli.  Patterns of brain activation were measured with whole brain echoplanar functional  magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla in 5 adults (20-28 years old), 7 children  (9-12 years old), and 6 pediatric patients (9-12 years old) with perinatal strokes  or periventricular hemorrhages. Healthy children and adults activated similar  neurocognitive networks, but there were developmental differences in the  distribution of activity across these networks. In the sentence task, children  showed more activation in the inferior visual area suggesting an imagery strategy  rather than a linguistic strategy for sentence processing. Furthermore, consistent  use of a sentence comprehension strategy, whether correct or incorrect as compared  to chance performance, was associated with greater activation in the inferior  frontal area (Broca's) in both children and pediatric patients. In the mental  rotation task, healthy adults showed more activation in the superior parietal and  middle frontal areas and less activation in the supramarginal gyrus, suggesting  adults were primarily engaged in visual-spatial manipulation and less engaged in the  recognition of noncanonical views of stimuli. The pediatric patients showed patterns  of activation consistent with organization of cognitive processing into homologous  areas of the contralateral hemisphere.

Questionnaires and tests on spatial anxiety, sense of direction, spatial abilities and spatial representation were used for all patients. The experimental group followed the program OSA (Orientamento Spaziale Anziani) - a specific spatial training designed to the improvement of spatial ability in aging - for a period of approximately two months. At the end of the treatment the experimental participants expressed high motivation and satisfaction toward the treatment. Moreover, they improved self-ratings of sense of direction and spatial representation significantly more than the control group. This experience is a useful example for the assessment of topographical orientation and for the treatment of disorientation.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Deaf students also frequently struggle in mathematics and science, but fewer studies have examined possible reasons for those difficulties. The present study examined numerical and non-numerical (real-world) estimation skills among deaf and hearing college students, together with several cognitive abilities likely to underlie mathematics performance. Drawing on claims in the literature and some limited evidence from research involving deaf children, the study also considered the possibility that the use of sign language and/or the use of cochlear implants and spoken language might facilitate deaf college students’ estimation skills and mathematics achievement more broadly. Results indicated relatively little impact of cochlear implant use or language modality on either estimation skills or overall mathematics ability. Predictors of those abilities differed for deaf and hearing learners. Results suggest the need to guard against overgeneralizations either within the diverse population of deaf learners or between deaf and hearing learners. They further emphasize the need for evidence-based practice in mathematics instruction appropriate for older deaf learners, rather than making assumptions from studies involving younger or narrowly-selected samples. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Results of 3 experiments with 61 4- and 12-mo-olds show that (a) 4-mo-old infants showed no preference for symmetry, but they processed vertically symmetrical patterns more efficiently than horizontally symmetrical or asymmetrical ones; and (b) by 12 mo, infants preferred vertical symmetry to horizontal symmetry and asymmetry. Thus, preference for symmetry seems to develop late, whereas recognition of vertical symmetry is innate, matures very quickly, or is learned very early.

Better spatial  skills are correlated with more spatial play and more parental attention to spatial  concepts. Tested here was whether informing mothers about spatial thinking and ways  to encourage it would increase the spatial guidance they provide to their preschool  children (N = 41; M = 5.23 years) during dyadic block play. Mothers given such  instructions indeed produced more spatial language and spatial guidance than mothers  asked to play as usual. In instructed dyads, children also used more spatial  language; both mothers and children engaged in less pretend play. Findings offer  support for designing interventions to encourage parents to foster their children's  spatial skills.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Nevertheless, previous studies of WS spatial capacities have ignored the fact that two different spatial memory systems are believed to contribute parallel spatial representations supporting navigation. The place learning system depends on the hippocampal formation and creates flexible relational representations of the environment, also known as cognitive maps. The spatial response learning system depends on the striatum and creates fixed stimulus-response representations, also known as habits. Indeed, no study assessing WS spatial competence has used tasks which selectively target these two spatial memory systems. Here, we report that individuals with WS exhibit a dissociation in their spatial abilities subserved by these two memory systems. As compared to typically developing (TD) children in the same mental age range, place learning performance was impaired in individuals with WS. In contrast, their spatial response learning performance was facilitated. Our findings in individuals with WS and TD children suggest that place learning and response learning interact competitively to control the behavioral strategies normally used to support human spatial navigation. Our findings further suggest that the neural pathways supporting place learning may be affected by the genetic deletion that characterizes WS, whereas those supporting response learning may be relatively preserved. The dissociation observed between these two spatial memory systems provides a coherent theoretical framework to characterize the spatial abilities of individuals with WS, and may lead to the development of new learning strategies based on their facilitated response learning abilities. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It also sought to determine if children with the reverse pattern of abilities would retain less verbal information if it was presented in a context of music. Twelve verbally oriented and 12 visual-spatially oriented learning disabled children between the ages of 9 and 11 matched on IQ, sex, race, and age participated. Subjects listened in a counter-balanced fashion to: (a) lyrics sung with instrumental musical accompanimen; (b) lyrics sung without instrumental accompaniment; (c) lyrics spoken with instrumental musical accompaniment; and (d) lyrics spoken without musical accompaniment. Immediately following the presentation of each condition they were tested for recall and recognition of the verbal material contained in the lyrics. The same tests were administered three days later. Subjects in the visual-spatial group obtained significantly higher recognition scores when the lyrics were sung than when they were spoken whether instrumental musical accompaniment was or was not present.

database	BOTTARI, STEVEN SCOTT	1980	thesis	THE EFFECTS OF MUSICAL CONTEXT, TYPE OF VOCAL PRESENTATION, AND TIME ON THE VERBAL RETENTION ABILITIES OF VISUAL-SPATIALLY ORIENTED AND VERBALLY ORIENTED LEARNING DISABLED CHILDREN		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-musical-context-type-vocal-presentation/docview/303096269/se-2?accountid=11531	The main concern of this study was to determine if the retention capacities of children with strong visual-spatial skills and weak verbal skills (visual-spatially oriented learning disabled children) would be improved if verbal material was presented within a musical context. This study also sought to determine if children with the reverse pattern of abilities (verbally oriented learning disabled children) would retain more verbal information if it was not presented in a context of music.    Twelve verbally oriented and 12 visual-spatially oriented learning disabled children between the ages of 9 and 11 who were matched on IQ, sex, race, and age were used in this study. A 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 repeated measures factorial design was employed so that each of the subjects listened in a counterbalanced fashion to (1) lyrics sung with musical accompaniment, (2) lyrics sung without musical accompaniment, (3) lyrics spoken with musical accompaniment, and (4) lyrics spoken without musical accompaniment. Immediately following the presentation of each condition the subjects were given tests to assess their recall and recognition of the verbal material contained in the lyrics. The same tests were administered three days later.    The results of a pre-planned comparison revealed that subjects in the visual-spatial group obtained significantly higher recognition scores when the lyrics were sung with accompanying music than when they were spoken without accompanying music. However, subjects in the visual-spatial group obtained significantly higher scores on the recognition measure when the lyrics were sung than when they were spoken whether or not musical accompaniment was present. Apparently it was singing and not musical accompaniment that improved recognition scores. No differential effects on either the recall or recognition measures were obtained for subjects in the verbal group.    The results of this study indicate that hearing others sing verbal material can help facilitate learning in children who perform relatively well on visual-spatial tasks usually associated with right hemispheric functioning but relatively poorly on verbal tasks usually associated with left hemispheric functioning. Furthermore, the results of this study support the theory that greater verbal learning may be accomplished by the right hemisphere if the material is presented in an appropriate manner.

Environmental health perspectives	https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.11294	OBJECTIVES: A large body of literature documents the effects of prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on cognitive development of children. Despite this  fact, no integrative synthesis has been published yet to identify the cognitive  functions that are particularly affected. Our aim is to review this literature in an  attempt to identify the cognitive profile associated with prenatal PCB exposure.  DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified by searching the PubMed database for articles  published before June 2008. We reviewed data from nine prospective longitudinal  birth cohorts for different aspects of cognition. DATA EXTRACTION: Associations  between indicators of prenatal PCB exposure and performance on cognitive tasks  reported in the selected studies are summarized and classified as general cognitive  abilities, verbal or visual-spatial skills, memory, attention, and executive  functions. DATA SYNTHESIS: The most consistent effects observed across studies are  impaired executive functioning related to increased prenatal PCB exposure. Negative  effects on processing speed, verbal abilities, and visual recognition memory are  also reported by most studies. Converging results from different cohort studies in  which exposure arises from different sources make it unlikely that co-exposure with  another associated contaminant is responsible for the observed effects. CONCLUSION:  Prenatal PCB exposure appears to be related to a relatively specific cognitive  profile of impairments. Failure to assess functions that are specifically impaired  may explain the absence of effects found in some studies. Our findings have  implications in the selection of cognitive assessment methods in future studies.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Before being able to write, the child has to develop motor, perceptual and spatial skills in order to be able to use the educational instruments, to draw forms and trace lines. This development is perfected over the years and sometimes school demands can be too heavy. Certain contradictions may appear and create difficulties for the child. For some children, this leads to a consultation with a health professional. This article attempts to update the link between the genesis of writing in children, which has been described for a number of years, and to check it's adequation with the demands made by school programs. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Developmental psychology	https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0001098	Early spatial skills predict the development of later spatial and mathematical skills. Yet, it is unclear how comprehension of the words that capture spatial  relations, words like behind and under, might be associated with children's early  spatial and mathematics skills. The current study addressed this question by  conducting a moderated mediation model to test the potential moderating effects of  group factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES) and gender, on the possible  mediation of spatial language comprehension on the association between spatial skill  and mathematics performance. In total, 192 3-year-olds were tested on a battery of  assessments, including a novel Spatial Language Comprehension Task, a test of  spatial skills (2- and 3-dimensional trials of the Test of Spatial Assembly [2D and  3D TOSA, respectively]), and a composite of 2 mathematical assessments. The results  indicate that this novel Spatial Language Comprehension Task is a reliable measure  useful for examining group differences and the early space-math link. Specifically,  higher-SES preschoolers and females had higher spatial language comprehension  compared with their lower-SES peers and males, respectively. These SES and gender  disparities in spatial language comprehension are concerning, given the strong  association between spatial language comprehension and mathematics skills.  Additionally, spatial language comprehension mediated the association between  spatial skill and mathematics performance for females only. Future work should  examine the potential causal role that spatial language comprehension may have in  concurrent and later spatial and mathematics skills.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.13148	Spatial skills support STEM learning and achievement. However, children from low-socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds typically lag behind their middle- and high-SES  peers. We asked whether a digital educational app-designed to mirror an already  successful, spatial assembly training program using concrete materials-would be as  effective for facilitating spatial skills in under-resourced preschoolers as the  concrete materials. Three-year-olds (N = 61) from under-resourced backgrounds were  randomly assigned to a business-as-usual control group or to receive 5 weeks of  spatial training using either concrete, tangible materials or a digital app on a  tablet. The spatial puzzles used were an extension of items from the Test of Spatial  Assembly (TOSA). Preschoolers were pretested and posttested on new two-dimensional  (2D) TOSA trials. Results indicate that both concrete and digital spatial training  increased performance on the 2D-TOSA compared to the control group. The two  trainings did not statistically differ from one another suggesting that educational  spatial apps may be one route to providing early foundational skills to children  from under-resourced backgrounds.

Journal of cognition and development : official journal of the Cognitive Development Society	https://doi.org/10.1080/15248372.2020.1741363	Block-building skills at age 3 are related to spatial skills at age 5 and spatial skills in grade school are linked to later success in science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields (Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2009; Wai,  Lubinski, Benbow, & Steiger, 2010). Though studies have focused on block-building  behaviors and design complexity, few have examined these variables in relation to  future spatial and mathematical skills or have considered how children go about  copying the model in detail. This study coded 3-year-olds' (N = 102) block-building  behaviors and structural complexity on 3-D trials of the Test of Spatial Assembly  (TOSA; Verdine, Golinkoff, Hirsh-Pasek, & Newcombe, 2017). It explored whether  individual differences in children's building behaviors and the complexity of their  designs related to accuracy in copying the model block structures or their spatial  and mathematical skills at ages 4 and 5. Our findings reveal that block-building  behaviors were associated with concurrent and later spatial skills while structural  complexity was associated with concurrent and later spatial skills as well as  concurrent mathematics skills. Future work might teach children to engage in the  apparently successful block-building strategies examined in this research to  evaluate a potential causal mechanism.

The current study tested (a) whether spatial training benefited preschoolers’ spatial and mathematics skills, (b) if the type of feedback provided during spatial training differentially influenced children’s spatial and mathematics skills, and (c) if the spatial training’s effects varied by socioeconomic status (SES). Preschoolers (N = 187) were randomly assigned to either a ‘business-as-usual’ control or one of three spatial training groups (modeling and feedback [MF]; gesture feedback [GF]; spatial language feedback [SLF]). Three-year-olds were trained to construct puzzles to match a model composed of various geometric shapes. New models were created similar to the 2-dimensional trials of the Test of Spatial Assembly (TOSA). Training was given once per week for 5 weeks. Preschoolers were pretested and posttested on 2D and 3D TOSA trials, spatial vocabulary, shape identification, and 2 mathematics assessments. Results indicate that first, any spatial training improved preschoolers’ 2D TOSA performance, although a significant interaction with SES indicated improvement was driven by low-SES children. Furthermore, low-SES children showed greatest gains on the 2D TOSA with MF and GF. Second, MF and GF improved low-SES children’s performance on the 3D TOSA. Third, only low-SES children with MF saw improvements in far-transfer to mathematics (Woodcock-Johnson: Applied Problems, but not the Test of Early Mathematical Ability). Results indicate that, especially for low-income learners, spatial training can improve children’s early spatial and mathematics skills.

JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons		BACKGROUND: Music education affects the mathematical and visuo-spatial skills of school-age children. Visuo-spatial abilities have a significant effect on  laparoscopic suturing performance. We hypothesize that prior music experience  influences the performance of laparoscopic suturing tasks. METHODS: Thirty novices  observed a laparoscopic suturing task video. Each performed 3 timed suturing task  trials. Demographics were recorded. A repeated measures linear mixed model was used  to examine the effects of prior music experience on suturing task time. RESULTS:  Twelve women and 18 men completed the tasks. When adjusted for video game  experience, participants who currently played an instrument performed significantly  faster than those who did not (P<0.001). The model showed a significant sex by  instrument interaction. Men who had never played an instrument or were currently  playing an instrument performed better than women in the same group (P=0.002 and  P<0.001). There was no sex difference in the performance of participants who had  played an instrument in the past (P=0.29). CONCLUSION: This study attempted to  investigate the effect of music experience on the laparoscopic suturing abilities of  surgical novices. The visuo-spatial abilities used in laparoscopic suturing may be  enhanced in those involved in playing an instrument.

Journal of Experimental Child Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2011.11.001	The current experiments examined the role of scale factor in children's proportional reasoning. Experiment 1 used a choice task and Experiment 2 used a production task to examine the abilities of kindergartners through fourth-graders to match equivalent, visually depicted proportional relations. The findings of both experiments show that accuracy decreased as the scaling magnitude between the equivalent proportions increased. In addition, children's errors showed that the cost of scaling proportional relations is symmetrical for problems that involve scaling up and scaling down. These findings indicate that scaling has a cognitive cost that results in decreasing performance with increasing scaling magnitude. These scale factor effects are consistent with children's use of intuitive strategies to solve proportional reasoning problems that may be important in scaffolding more formal mathematical understanding of proportional relations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Developmental stage, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status have also been shown to influence how readily an individual can acquire and maintain their spatial reasoning ability. While many interventions have been developed to improve spatial visualization and mental rotation, these interventions have shown potential negative consequences and are not necessarily tailored specifically to young children. Block play interventions have traditionally helped children develop these spatial reasoning abilities. Likewise, socialized play has shown to improve a child's functioning across social and cognitive domains but has been relatively understudied in relation to spatial development. The current study examined if children who engage in more socialized block play improved their spatial reasoning ability over time. Additionally, this study examined if gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status affected a child's improvement in spatial reasoning over time. Preschool children were administered the Spatial Transformation Task before and after an 8 week block play intervention. Video data from each play session was coded for engagement in solitary, dyadic, group play as well as off-task behavior. It was determined that children who engage in more solitary play showed slight improvement in their spatial ability over time. Additionally, off-task behavior negatively predicated spatial skill outcomes. Neither dyadic nor group social block play significantly improved spatial reasoning. Gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status were not related to spatial skill outcomes. This indicates that solitary play is more predictive of improving spatial outcomes overall when compared to socialized block play.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	4 and 5 y olds	3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Tankle and Heilman (Brain and Language, 1982, 17, 124-132) report a sinistral superiority in (obligatory) reading of left-right mirror-reversed text. However, in an investigation which included various other forms of geometrical transformation of the written word, we find that strong familial sinistrals are either not different from or even slightly inferior to dextrals in reading most transformations, including left-right mirror reversals. © 1985.

Eighty-four participants were randomly assigned to three intervention groups: programmable-robot-based intervention, traditional intervention, control group. Spatial ability was examined pre- and post-10 intervention sessions. Findings indicate that the children exposed to the programmable-robot intervention displayed significantly higher spatial-relations and mental-rotation improvement compared with the traditional intervention and control group. However, the robot did not contribute to visual-memory. The study emphasizes the importance of finding innovative ways to promote spatial ability in young children. © 2021 ISTE.

This article describes an integrated phonics and literature-based approach to developing children's emergent literacy skills. These skills included alphabet knowledge, phonemic awareness, phonics and nonsense word competence, and language usage. Using Howard Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligence, the program's literacy activities addressed children's interpersonal, intrapersonal, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, musical, naturalistic, and visual-spatial abilities and interests. Stories from children's trade books were told in a variety of storytelling methods, such as draw talk, character imagery, felt board, group role play, and chant. These approaches were matched to children's interests and multiple intelligence areas. All of the storytelling sessions were followed by related activities that incorporated the children's emergent literacy skills. Results from this study of 13 inner-city children indicated that this integrated, seven-week program resulted in significant gains in phonemic awareness, nonsense word competence, and word usage fluency. The Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) was used as a pretest and a posttest to assess children's initial and later competence on the basic emergent literacy skills. Implications for further research on this integrated approach are discussed. © 2006 by the Association for Childhood Education International.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	3	3	0	0	1

Such skills are used daily in elementary school, particularly in mathematics, reading, and writing. Occupational therapists frequently work with children with visual-spatial deficits in the school system. Occupational therapists are always searching for modalities that are fun, meaningful and purposeful to use in the treatment of children. Chess is a game that requires the use of visual-spatial skills and can be both challenging and self-motivating to children.    This study focused on the visual-spatial skills of children that play chess. Data was obtained from 30 children between the ages of 7 and 10 that play chess. The visual-spatial subtest of the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA), a standardized test, was used to analyze the relationship of scores from children that choose to play chess both frequently and less frequently with the expected performance for their age in the norm sample reported in the WRAVMA manual.    The hypothesis of this study is that children choosing to play chess will score above the mean on the WRAVMA. The second hypothesis is that children that engage in playing chess more hours per week, will show a greater difference from the mean on the WRAVMA test of visual-spatial relations, than children that engage in playing chess less hours per week. The final hypothesis is that there will be a positive correlation between time playing chess and scores on the WRAVMA.    The results showed a trend to support the first two hypotheses, however, they were not statistically significant. The results indicate that there is a need for future research to validate the effectiveness of chess as a means to enhance visual-spatial skills, and thus as a modality for occupational therapists.

We have found previously that combined pre- and postnatal choline supplementation results in long-lasting facilitation of spatial memory in juvenile rats when training was conducted in presence of a local salient cue. The present work aims to analyze the effects of peri- and postnatal choline supplementation on spatial abilities of naive adult rats. Treated rats were trained in various cued procedures of the Morris navigation task of 5 months of age. The treatment had a specific effect of reducing the escape latency of the rats when the platform was at a fixed location in space and indicated by a suspended cue. This effect was associated with an improved spatial memory when the cue and the platform were removed. In this condition, the control rats showed impaired spatial discrimination following the removal of the target cue, most likely due to an overshadowing of the distant environmental cues. This impairment was not observed in the treated rats. Further training with the suspended cue at unpredictable places in the pool revealed longer escape latencies in the control than in the treated rats suggesting that this procedure induced a selective perturbation of the normal but not of the treated rats. A special probe trial with the cue at an irrelevant location and no escape platform revealed a significant bias of the control rats towards the cue, but in treated rats towards the uncued spatial escape position. This behavioral dissociation suggests that a salient cue associated with the target induces an alternative 'non spatial' guidance strategy in normal rats, with the risk of overshadowing attention towards more distant spatial cues. As a consequence, the improved escape in the presence of the cue in the treated rats is associated with a stronger memory of the spatial position following disappearance of the cue. This and previous observations suggest that a specific spatial attentional process relies on the buffering of highly salient visual cues to facilitate integration of their relative position in the environment. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The treated rats were trained at the age of 22 days to escape onto an invisible platform at a fixed position in space in a Morris navigation task. For half of the subjects, the training position was also cued, a procedure aimed at facilitating escape and reducing attention to the distant spatial cues. At the age of 2 months all the rats were retrained in the same task. Treatment effects were found in both immature and adult rats. The injection of NGF induced a slight alteration of the immature rats' performance. In contrast, a marked impairment of spatial abilities was shown in the 2-month-old rats. The most consistent effects were a significant increase in the escape latency and a decrease bias towards the training platform area during probe trials. The reduction of spatial memory was particularly marked if the subjects had been trained in a cued condition. Taken together, these experiments reveal that an acute pharmacological treatment that leads to transient modifications during early development might induce a behavioural change long after treatment. Thus, the development and the maintenance of an accurate spatial representation are tightly related to the development of brain structures that could be altered by precocious NGF administrations.

Cognitive processing	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-013-0561-5	Time-space synesthesia is a variant of sequence-space synesthesia and involves the involuntary association of months of the year with 2D and 3D spatial forms, such as  arcs, circles, and ellipses. Previous studies have revealed conflicting results  regarding the association between time-space synesthesia and enhanced spatial  processing ability. Here, we tested 15 time-space synesthetes, and 15  non-synesthetic controls matched for age, education, and gender on standard tests of  mental rotation ability, spatial working memory, and verbal working memory.  Synesthetes performed better than controls on our test of mental rotation, but  similarly to controls on tests of spatial and verbal working memory. Results support  a dissociation between visuo-spatial imagery and spatial working memory capacity,  and suggest time-space synesthesia is associated only with enhanced visuo-spatial  imagery. These data are consistent with the time-space connectivity thesis that  time-space synesthesia results from enhanced connectivity in the parietal lobe  between regions supporting the representation of temporal sequences and those  underlying visuo-spatial imagery.

Thus, endocrine disrupting chemicals that impact sex steroids during gestation may affect these behaviors. Objective We investigated the relationship between prenatal urinary phthalate metabolite, triclosan, and BPA concentrations and visual-spatial abilities in a prospective cohort of 198 mother-child dyads. Methods Data are from a prospective cohort in Cincinnati, OH (HOME Study). We measured nine phthalate metabolites, triclosan, and BPA in maternal urine samples collected at 16 and 26 weeks of gestation. We assessed children's visual-spatial abilities at 8 years of age using the Virtual Morris Water Maze (VMWM), a computerized version of the rodent Morris Water Maze. We quantified the covariate-adjusted change in the time or distance to complete the VMWM and time spent in the correct quadrant during a probe trial with an interquartile range increase in chemical concentrations using linear mixed models and linear regression, respectively. Results Boys completed the VMWM faster (4.1 s; 95% CI:−7.1, −1.2) and in less distance (1.4 units; 95% CI:−2.8, 0) than girls. Overall, children with higher mono-n-butyl (MnBP), mono-benzyl (MBzP), and mono-carboxypropyl phthalate concentrations completed the VMWM in less time and distance than children with lower concentrations. For example, children with higher MnBP concentrations completed the VMWM in 0.9 less distance units (95% CI:−1.8, −0.0). Child sex modified the association between MnBP and VMWM performance. In girls, higher MnBP concentrations were associated with longer time (1.7 s; 95% CI: −0.7, 4.1) and shorter distance (−1.7 units; 95% CI: −2.8, −0.5), whereas in boys, it was associated with shorter time (-3.0 s; 95% CI:−5.6, −0.4), but not distance (−0.1 units; 95% CI:1.4, 1.0). Other phthalate metabolites, triclosan, and BPA were not associated with VMWM performance, and sex did not consistently modify these associations. Conclusions In this cohort, greater prenatal urinary concentrations of some phthalate metabolites were associated with improved VMWM performance, particularly among boys. Future studies should confirm these findings and determine if phthalates affect other hormonally sensitive aspects of child neurobehavior. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Fourth and fifth graders participated in one of three five-day, whole-class instructional programs: TV's use of pictorial elements, TV's use of characterizations, or a control class. Attentional effects were examined by providing half the students with specific viewing instructions at the time of testing and half with no such directions. Six aptitude measures were also given. Factor analysis of these revealed two moderately correlated factors corresponding to verbal and spatial ability, which were included as aptitudes in the study along with amount of home viewing, measured by questionnaire. This design allowed for the detection of main effects for instruction, attention, and aptitudes, and of aptitude-treatment interactions (ATI).    The week following instruction, students viewed a half-hour, commercially produced videotape and then took the multiple-choice posttest, which consisted of three subtests covering narrative information, pictorial information, and characterizations. Items were projected and read aloud simultaneously to facilitate comprehension. Testing for pictorial and characterization information involved the replay of 30-second clips from the program.    Scores on the total test and each subtest were analyzed in a three-step multiple regression procedure. Significant main effects were not found for attention or instructional treatment. Verbal ability was significantly related to scores on all dependent measures, while spatial ability was significantly related only to pictorial information and the total score. Amount of home television viewing showed no relation to learning. Several ATI appeared, in each of which the relationship between ability and learning was stronger in the control group than the instructional group.    The discussion considered recent hypotheses regarding the decoding processes required by the television medium. Suggestions were provided for modifying the instructional treatments and attentional manipulations. The aptitude results were interpreted in terms of possible underlying processing patterns and the relationship of information-processing mechanisms to media stimulus properties. The ATI indicated that instruction in television formats can be beneficial in raising the learning potential of low-ability students, while it has less effect on the performance of high-ability students.

Psychological reports	https://doi.org/10.2466/pr0.1997.80.3.863	WISC-III subtest scores of 180 children referred because of academic difficulties were analyzed for differences based on age (M = 9.6, SD = 2.7) and IQ. Rank-orders  of all subtests indicated no significant correlations across the six age-IQ groups,  suggesting that interpretation of changes in subtest rankings may require  consideration of age and IQ, especially for such children. When data were organized  into Acquired Knowledge, Spatial Ability, and speed-related task categories,  analyses of variance showed a main effect for IQ. Furthermore, scores on Acquired  Knowledge were associated with age at the lower category of IQ, whereas Spatial  Ability and speed-related tasks were not related to age.

A fixed-trial familiarization procedure based on visual habituation behaviour shows that both age groups are able to discriminate between different object-centred spatial configurations. Furthermore, both age groups demonstrate the ability to make discriminations of object-centred spatial coordinates that require simultaneous reference to at least two spatial axes of the object. We discuss these findings in relation to theories of the early development of object recognition and spatial reference skills.	AE	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		ASK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		5	5	1	NA	5	0	0	1

Findings show the following: (a) Previous search experience at 1 place promoted response perseveration or egocentric spatial coding on later trials. (b) Infants were better at locating the object after they had moved than they were after the object had moved. (c) Differentiation of the covers for the 2 locations provided a more salient cue to allocentric position than differentiation of the surrounds of the 2 locations. The 2nd finding is taken as support for the hypothesis that as infants begin to crawl, they become better able to take into account their own displacements within a stable space but difficulties remain with the displacements of objects.

Because of the need to provide necessary mathematical experiences to young children to improve their early understanding and skills and provide the foundation for future success in mathematics, we provided the treatment group of early educators with professional development and center-based activities to promote four critical areas in mathematics. By randomly selecting Head Start centers to participate as the treatment group or control group, we were able to examine the effects of the professional development and set of activities on preschool children's knowledge over a six-month period. We found children in the treatment group were more fluent and flexible with number concepts, were better at solving contextual problems, and had better measurement and spatial abilities than children in the control group. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Extensive difficulties with both types of imagined rotation were observed in WS; WS performance was in line with the level of ability observed in TD 5-year-olds. However, an atypical pattern of errors on OB and VPT tasks was observed in WS compared to TD groups. Deficits in imagined rotations are consistent with known atypical cortical development in WS. Such difficulties in updating the position of the self following movement in WS may have implications for large-scale spatial navigation. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The Journal of pediatrics	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-3476(05)80896-0	The Infant Health and Development Program is a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of educational and family support services and pediatric follow-up, offered  during the first 3 years of life, in reducing the incidence of developmental delay  in low birth weight preterm infants at eight clinical sites (N = 985). It was  hypothesized that larger intervention effects would be found for the domains in  which low birth weight preterm infants are known to have problems, specifically  visual-motor and spatial skills and receptive language skills. These analyses  explore the effects of the Infant Health and Development Program on different  domains of cognitive functioning. Cognitive domains are identified by means of  factor analysis of the intelligence tests used at 12, 24, and 36 months (Bayley  Scales of Infant Development (including the Mental and Motor scales) at 12 and 24  months; the Stanford-Binet, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and Beery Test of  Visual Motor Intergration at 36 months). Our results reveal that, although  intervention benefits accrue across cognitive domains at 24 and 36 months, gains are  most pronounced for receptive language and visual-motor and spatial skills.

Gesture often facilitates task performance by interacting with internal mental representations, but how this process works is not well understood. We investigated this question by exploring the case of mental abacus (MA), a technique in which users not only imagine moving beads on an abacus to compute sums, but also produce movements in gestures that accompany the calculations. Because the content of MA is transparent and readily manipulated, the task offers a unique window onto how gestures interface with mental representations. We find that the size and number of MA gestures reflect the length and difficulty of math problems. Also, by selectively interfering with aspects of gesture, we find that participants perform significantly worse on MA under motor interference, but that perceptual feedback is not critical for success on the task. We conclude that premotor processes involved in the planning of gestures are critical to mental representation in MA. Copyright © 2017 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

Child (30 boys and 20 girls) were asked  to construct a specific three-dimensional model using Lego blocks and were also  given the Shepard and Metzler test of mental rotation. Those who completed the Lego  model scored significantly higher in spatial ability than those who did not.  Constructional ability was also related to errors made during the construction of  the model, but spatial ability was the best predictor of completion of the model.

In adults with Williams Syndrome, the profile is of impaired visuo-spatial skills, number concepts, and problem solving, with good language and face processing skills. Recent research has shown that language and face processing are not 'preserved' abilities, in that the processes involved differ from those used by normal controls. Down's syndrome is a more common genetic syndrome, with a relatively level cognitive profile. The purpose of this thesis was to examine aspects of visual cognition in infants and young children with Williams and Down's syndromes, to determine whether the cognitive profile found in adults is present from infancy, or whether the end state is a product of the relationship between impaired systems interacting in an aberrant way with environmental factors. Four groups of infants and young children were recruited and tested on a range of measures of visual cognition: children with Williams syndrome, children with Down's syndrome, chronological age matched controls, and mental age matched controls. All children were tested with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, in order to obtain a general measure of development for matching purposes. The experimental tasks given to all four groups examined face processing, saccade planning, sustained attention, and temperament. Relationships between measures were also examined. The results indicate that the pattern of impairments found in adults with Williams syndrome are not wholly reflected in infancy. Although precursors of impairment were found for some domains, other areas of difficulty experienced in adulthood were not found in infancy. Findings are discussed in terms of the impact of impairments on the development of other cognitive abilities, and methodological problems in testing atypically developing infants are considered.

Research has shown that African-American children score lower than non-minority children on intelligence tests. Reasons for the difference in scores for minorities are not fully known, however it is believed that cultural and environmental factors do have an impact.    There is a dearth of information available about the performance of African-American children on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, now in its third edition (WISC-III). The purpose of this research project was to determine whether a unique scoring pattern, with strengths and weaknesses, emerged from the WISC-III test scores of a sample of African-American children. Data from the archival records of two different assessment environments, the Diagnostic Treatment Department of the 22nd Judicial Circuit of Missouri, Family Court-Juvenile Division and the Archdiocese of St. Louis Guidance Center, were utilized in this study.    Scores for 205 African-American children were collected. The children in this sample scored more than 20 points below the mean of 100 for the WISC-III standardization sample on the composite scores. There was no significant discrepancy between the Verbal and Performance IQ scores for the children in the present study. Moreover, a popular alternative for interpreting WISC subtest scores for minority children and those with learning problems, suggested by Bannatyne (Spatial Ability $>$ Verbal Conceptualization Ability $>$ Sequential Ability), was not found. Finally, while the low scores achieved by the children in this sample likely reflect the presence of problems in academic achievement, no unique pattern of WISC-III scores emerged. The use of less achievement-laden intelligence tests and other assessment measurements that better address specific referral questions is encouraged.

ZDM Mathematics Education	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11858-014-0637-4	The ability to mentally rotate objects in space has been singled out by cognitive scientists as a central metric of spatial reasoning (see Jansen, Schmelter, Quaiser-Pohl, Neuburger, & Heil, 2013; Shepard & Metzler, 1971 for example). However, this is a particularly undeveloped area of current mathematics curricula, especially in North America. In this article we discuss what we mean by mental rotation, why it is important, and how it can be developed with young children in classrooms. We feature results from one team of teacher-researchers in Canada engaged in Lesson Study to develop enhanced theoretical understandings as well as practical applications in a geometry program that incorporates 2D and 3D mental rotations. Children in the Lesson Study classrooms (ages 4–8 years) demonstrated large gains in their mental rotation skills during 4 months of Lesson Study intervention in the Math for Young Children research program. The results of this study suggest that young children from a wide range of ability levels can engage in, and benefit from, classroom-based mental rotation activities. The study contributes to bridging a gap between cognitive science and mathematics education literature. © 2014, FIZ Karlsruhe.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The findings (1) outline the needs for tools and methods to help children to acquire spatial skills and (2) provide four design guidelines for educational assistive technologies. Based on these findings and an iterative process, we designed and deployed MapSense in the institute during two days. It enables collaborations between children with a broad range of impairments, proposes reflective and ludic scenarios and allows caretakers to customize it as they wish.

Girls, however, do not play with the same prevalence as do boys and, thus, may not have the same access to the benefits of such play. To explore why, we perform an inventory of the technology-based games available in the USA and evaluate them vis-à-vis a technology-as-a-male critique, girls' and boys' play styles and the differences in game preferences among young men and women. The results show that games that match the play styles and preferences of girls are underrepresented not because the technology skews towards males, but rather because the preferences of girls and young women have simply been overlooked. The implications for socialising girls into technology and developing products that are attractive to girls (thus, tapping into a potentially lucrative but overlooked market segment) are discussed.

Pre-eclampsia is the most significant cause of neurological symptoms in pregnancy. Neurological symptoms may persist even after pregnancy. Somatic symptoms of pre-eclampsia, such as hypertension and proteinuria, generally disappear after delivery. However, formerly pre-eclamptic women more often complain of cognitive disturbances compared to women after uncomplicated pregnancies. Methods. Three to eight months postpartum, a neuropsychological test battery was performed in 10 former severely pre-eclamptic women (according to the guidelines of the American College Obstetricians and Gynecologists) and 10 women after uncomplicated normotensive pregnancies. The control group was matched for age, educational level and mode of anesthesia. All women delivered by cesarean section either under general or regional anesthesia. Tests were performed for premorbid intelligence, short- and long-term memory, attention, concentration, executive functions, visual and spatial abilities. Anxiety and depression levels were measured. Results. The formerly pre-eclamptic women had significantly lower scores on most indices of the auditory-verbal memory test. Formerly pre-eclamptic patients learned considerably fewer words than controls and recalled less after interference. Both case and control group did not differ in age, parity or level of education. There were no differences in the level of intellectual functioning and language tests, such as naming and word fluency. No persistent differences were observed in tests for attention/concentration and executive functioning. There were no significant differences on depression and anxiety scales. Conclusions. Maternal memory seems to be impaired after pregnancies complicated by severe pre-eclampsia. This effect cannot be attributed to depression and/or anxiety or method of anesthesia. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Methods We used two conceptually distinct voxel-based magnetic resonance imaging methods to examine brain structure in young males with XYY syndrome: (1) volumetric comparison to assess global grey and white matter volumes and (2) support vector machine-based multivariate pattern classification analysis to assess regional neuroanatomy. We assessed verbal, non-verbal, and spatial abilities with the Differential Ability Scales (DAS), and we measured autism diagnostic criteria in eight males with XYY syndrome using the Social Responsiveness Scale and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Results A comparison of 36 typically developing males (mean age 11y, SD 1y 9mo), 31 males with Klinefelter syndrome (mean age 9y 8mo, SD 1y 8mo), and eight males with XYY syndrome (mean age 11y 6mo, SD 1y 11mo) showed that total white and grey matter volumes were significantly, or nearly significantly, higher in males with XYY syndrome than in males belonging to the other two groups (grey matter: XYY males vs typically developing males, p<0.006; XYY vs males with Klinefelter syndrome, p<0.001; white matter: XYY males vs typically developing males, p=0.061; XYY males vs males with Klinefelter syndrome, p=0.004). Voxel-based multivariate pattern classification analysis indicates that, after controlling for global volumes, regional brain variations in XYY syndrome are more like those found in Klinefelter syndrome than those occurring in typical development. Further, visualization of classification parameters suggests that insular and frontotemporal grey matter and white matter, including known language areas, are reduced in males with XYY syndrome, similar to what is seen in Klinefelter syndrome. In males with XYY syndrome, DAS verbal and non-verbal scores were significantly lower than in typically developing participants (both p<0.001). DAS scores were not significantly different between XYY and Klinefelter syndrome groups. In five of eight males with XYY syndrome, the Social Responsiveness Scale score exceeded the cut-off for a likely diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In three of eight males with XYY syndrome, the ADI-R score met the cut-off for ASD diagnosis; in another two, ADI-R scores within the social and communication domains met the cut-off values for a diagnosis of ASD. Interpretation The results suggest that genetic variations associated with XYY syndrome result in increased brain matter volumes, a finding putatively related to the increased frequency of ASDs in individuals with this condition. In addition, frontotemporal grey and white matter reductions in XYY syndrome provide a likely neuroanatomical correlate for observed language impairments. © The Authors.

The exact nature of this deficit is not entirely clear, however, because the tasks that have been used to date (e.g., mental rotation, part-whole and left-right decisions, etc.) do not distinguish between what Kosslyn (1980) described as the two components of visual processing: locating an object in space (where?) and determining the identity of an object (what?). We report findings from an experiment designed to examine visual processing and working memory in children with TS and normal control children. However, unlike previous examinations of visuospatial processing in TS, the reported experiments tease apart what and where aspects of the visual system. Moreover, they examine separately the contributions of both visual and verbal working memory to visuospatial processing. Differences between children with TS and normal controls indicate that the core deficit is in visuospatial working memory. Correlations with karyotype information from the girls with TS provide some preliminary support for a gene-dosage hypothesis.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Our sample consisted of 1479 schoolchildren who had demonstrated high achievement in Science, Arts, or Sports. Several criteria were applied to evaluate the measurements, including an absence of floor and ceiling effects, low redundancy, high reliability, and external validity. Results. Based on these criteria, we included the following four tests in an Online Short Spatial Ability Battery “OSSAB”: Pattern Assembly; Mechanical Reasoning; Paper Folding; and Shape Rotation. Further analysis found differences in spatial ability across the three groups of gifted adolescents. The Science track showed the highest results in all four tests. Conclusion. Overall, the study suggested that the Online Short Spatial Ability Battery (OSSAB) can be used for talent identification, educational assessment, and support. The analysis showed a unifactorial structure of spatial abilities. Future research is needed to evaluate the use of this battery with other specific samples and unselected populations. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2021	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Early Head Start is a federal program that provides low-income families and their children from birth to age three with childcare, parenting education, healthcare and other family supports. As part of Early Head Start's initiation, a program evaluation was begun involving 3,001 children from 17 programs around the country. Half of the children were randomly assigned to the control group, who received no Early Head Start services. Data were collected through program application and enrollment forms, interviews of parents and child and family assessments. Almost all of the children's primary caretakers were mothers, ranging in age from 18 to 26. One-third were African American, one-third white, and one-fourth Hispanic. Almost half of the parents did not have a high school diploma at the time of enrollment, and most of the families received public support of some kind. For each child, a multiple environmental risk score was calculated, which was the sum of 10 possible environmental risks. Each of four outcomes was regressed onto the ten risks individually and also as a cumulative risk index along with program type and covariates. There were significant negative relations of accumulated risk to reductions in reasoning, spatial ability and vocabulary and increased behavior problems. Children with at least eight risks scored 1.48 standard deviations lower on reasoning ability and vocabulary, .48 standard deviations lower on spatial ability and .48 standard deviations higher on behavior problems. The home-based program showed significant benefit for reasoning and vocabulary. Versus the control group, home-based programs increased average reasoning scores by .24 of a standard deviation and increased vocabulary by .14 of a standard deviation. There was no significant difference in program benefits at different levels of risk. This suggests that for reasoning and vocabulary, the home-based program is promotive because the degree of benefit Early Head Start appears to provide is consistent across all levels of risk for the set of risks and outcomes examined in this study.

This study investigated sex and individual differences and relationships between 2D:4D (the ratio of the 2nd to 4th digit [digit ratio] as a proxy indicator of prenatal testosterone exposure), visual-spatial memory, and numerical skills in 5-year-old children. No sex differences were found in any of the numerical or visual-spatial tasks. Visual-spatial memory was positively correlated with arithmetic score. Girls with a lower (more masculinised) 2D:4D had better number sense and visual-spatial skills, whilst boys with lower 2D:4D had better arithmetic skills. This suggests that prenatal testosterone exposure may have differential effects on the visual-spatial and numerical skills of girls and boys. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that the four groups of culturally different children tended to exhibit four different patterns of cognitive abilities. The findings clarify those of Lesser, Fifer, and Clark (1965), who found that children in New York City of Jewish, Chinese, Afro-American, and Puerto Rican backgrounds differed in pattern of mental abilities, but left open the question of whether there was a single pattern characteristic of all Jewish children (or of any other cultural group). It was concluded that the historical-cultural background of a Jewish, or other, population has a significant effect on pattern of mental abilities. © 1990, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

This study used qualitative and quantitative methods to examine closely two spatial abilities, spatial visualisation (mental rotation from memory) and visual realism (three-dimensional drawing and construction ability) in students with reading problems and students with no problems. The aim was also to explore the question of whether students with spatial ability and reading problems were encouraged to use these strengths either in or out of school and whether such abilities could be identified in the early years environment. Equally, the question of motivational failure related to possible unrecognised potential, particularly in the area of non-verbal/spatial ability was also examined. This study used longitudinal case studies with five children and their mothers over a period of ten years. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Researcher observations as the teacher of the five children in their primary years provided additional evidence of their reading and spatial abilities at an early age. In addition, the study uses a Further Education College survey that examines spatial ability and reading problems in 133 post-16 year olds that provides the quantitative element of the study providing evidence about students with spatial abilities and their career choices. The data analysis revealed that the five case studies had largely overcome their reading problems due to early intervention strategies for reading together with encouragement and support outside school for their spatial abilities. Additionally, they have pursued careers, which for the most part, uses their spatial skills. The data analysis of the College survey showed that the link between spatial ability and reading problems was less secure, although there were a number of students with Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLD) who had high spatial abilities and this proved to be important from the point of view of identifying strengths alongside weakness in literacy, particularly in the early years at school. Early identification and acknowledgement of spatial ability as a perceived strength and used to support learning, as opposed to identification of reading problems, a perceived deficit, proved to be a key finding of the research.

Moreover, the current study is the first to explore sex-atypical hypothalamic responses to androstadienone in male and female individuals with GD at two different developmental stages. Our results suggest that individuals with GD possess certain functional brain characteristics of their experienced gender and might have undergone atypical neuronal sexual differentiation, most likely during early brain development and not during puberty. Additional analyses in other functional (e.g., mental rotation, emotional face matching, resting state data) and structural (e.g., gray and white matter volumes or diffusion tensor imaging data) MRI measures, which are in preparation, should corroborate the present preliminary findings. © 2015 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN	https://doi.org/10.1503/jpn.150147	BACKGROUND: Sex differences in performance and regional brain activity during mental rotation have been reported repeatedly and reflect organizational and activational  effects of sex hormones. We investigated whether adolescent girls with gender  dysphoria (GD), before and after 10 months of testosterone treatment, showed  male-typical brain activity during a mental rotation task (MRT). METHODS: Girls with  GD underwent fMRI while performing the MRT twice: when receiving medication to  suppress their endogenous sex hormones before onset of testosterone treatment, and  10 months later during testosterone treatment. Two age-matched control groups  participated twice as well. RESULTS: We included 21 girls with GD, 20 male controls  and 21 female controls in our study. In the absence of any group differences in  performance, control girls showed significantly increased activation in frontal  brain areas compared with control boys (p(FWE) = 0.012). Girls with GD before  testosterone treatment differed significantly in frontal brain activation from the  control girls (p(FWE) = 0.034), suggesting a masculinization of brain structures  associated with visuospatial cognitive functions. After 10 months of testosterone  treatment, girls with GD, similar to the control boys, showed increases in brain  activation in areas implicated in mental rotation. LIMITATIONS: Since all girls with  GD identified as gynephilic, their resemblance in spatial cognition with the control  boys, who were also gynephilic, may have been related to their shared sexual  orientation rather than their shared gender identity. We did not account for  menstrual cycle phase or contraceptive use in our analyses. CONCLUSION: Our findings  suggest atypical sexual differentiation of the brain in natal girls with GD and  provide new evidence for organizational and activational effects of testosterone on  visuospatial cognitive functioning.

Our cross-sectional study examined the incidence and severity of these impairments in a pediatric cohort without clinical cerebrovascular events from Berlin of mixed ethnic origin. Thirty-two SCD patients (mean age 11.14 years, range 7.0–17.25 years; males 14) were evaluated for full-scale intelligence (IQ) (German version WISC-III), fine motor function (digital writing tablet), and executive function (planning, attention, working memory, and visual-spatial abilities) with the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks (ANT) program and the Tower of London (ToL). Data on clinical risk factors were retrieved from medical records. Full-scale IQ of patients was preserved, whereas performance IQ was significantly reduced (91.19 (SD 12.17) d = 0.7, p = 0.007). SCD patients scored significantly lower than healthy peers when tested for executive and fine motor functions, e.g., planning time in the ToL (6.73 s (SD 3.21) vs. 5.9 s in healthy peers (SD 2.33), d = 0.5, p = <0.001) and frequency on the writing tablet (mean z score −0.79, d = 0.7, p < 0.001). No clinical risk factors were significantly associated with incidence and severity of cognitive and motor deficits. Despite the preservation of full-scale IQ, our SCD cohort of mixed origin exhibited inferior executive abilities and reduced fine motor skills. Our study is limited by the small size of our cohort as well as the lack for control of sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors modulating higher functions but highlights the need for early screening, prevention, and specific interventions for these deficits. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

database	Burns, Patrick; Russell, James	2016	journalArticle	Children’s predictions of future perceptual experiences: Temporal reasoning and phenomenology	Developmental Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0000197	We investigated the development and cognitive correlates of envisioning future experiences in 3.5- to 6.5-year old children across 2 experiments, both of which involved toy trains traveling along a track. In the first, children were asked to predict the direction of train travel and color of train side, as it would be seen through an arch. Children below 5 years typically failed the task, while performance on it was associated with performance on a 'before/after' comprehension task in which order-of-mention in a sentence had to be mapped to a video of 2 actions (after McCormack & Hanley, 2011). In the second train task children were asked to predict the content of a doll’s visual experience at the terminal point of a train’s transit, based on the tint of a doll’s spectacles and the direction of travel (toward or away). Again, success under 5 years of age was very rare and performance was associated with performance on the before/after task. This time there was a strong association with mental rotation skill. We conclude that the consistent association with before/after reasoning suggests that future-envisioning depends upon certain temporal-order concepts being in place. The inconsistent association with mental rotation suggests that envisioning can be achieved phenomenologically, but that its role is only explicit when the question explicitly concerns the content of a visual field.

In preclinical models of human cognition this concomitance can make it difficult to assess the relative contributions of declined vision and cognitive ability on behavioral measures of cognition. To assess the influence of age on cognition and the impact of visual decline on the performance of touchscreen-based behavioral paradigms in mice, aged (11, 12, 16, 17, 19 and 21 months old) male C57BL/6J mice were compared to young (3 or 4 months old) male C57BL/6J mice using three tests of cognition as well as an assessment of visual acuity. Performance of a Visual Discrimination, Spatial Reversal, and an Automated Search Task were all affected by age. However, there was no relationship between reduced visual acuity and the observed performance impairments. Moreover, the visual acuity of animals with profound cognitive impairments overlapped with those showing normal cognitive ability. Despite the potential confound of impaired visual ability, it appears that the touchscreen approach might be particularly effective in studying age-related cognitive decline. This approach will increase the utility of aged mice as a model of decreased cognitive flexibility and may be particularly important for the study of age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Researchers have found that children with NVLD often have significant symptoms of inattention, and there is evidence that the majority of children with NVLD also meet clinical criteria for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Subtype (ADHD:PI) (Brown, 2000; Gross-Tsur & Shalev, 1995; Voeller, 1996). Although significant overlap is observed between NVLD and behavioral symptoms of ADHD, little research has focused on the specific attention problems of children with NVLD.    Given the high incidence of co-morbid attention problems with NVLD (Brown, 2000), many researchers have proposed that overlapping neural regions are responsible for the similarity in attention impairments observed in both NVLD and ADHD:PI (Denckla, 2000; Stefanatos, 2001). Other researchers suggest that there are distinct neurological impairments in children with NVLD and both subtypes of ADHD that result in attention problems. Specifically, Rourke (1995) suggested a developmental sequence that results in generally intact auditory attention with impaired attention for visual stimuli in children with NVLD.    This study sought to reconcile the discrepancy between conceptualizations of attention problems in children with NVLD. It was hypothesized that children with NVLD would exhibit distinct profiles of strengths and weaknesses on neuropsychological measures of attention compared to children with ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Subtype (ADHD:PI) and ADHD, Combined Subtype (ADHD:C). Specifically, it was expected that the three diagnostic groups would differ on the neuropsychological measures depending on the attention modality (auditory vs. visual).   Extant neuropsychological data from 88 children between the ages of 9 and 15 years of age with diagnoses of NVLD, ADHD:PI, and ADHD:C were analyzed. Neuropsychological measures of processing speed, working memory, vigilance, and inhibition were examined to compare specific domains of attention functioning in the three groups. Evidence from the current study supported the model in which NVLD and the two ADHD subtypes represent a continuum of dysfunction dependant on overlapping neural regions. Moreover, specific attention strengths and weaknesses in children with NVLD compared to children with ADHD:PI, ADHD:C, and normative data were identified in order to inform clinical diagnosis and intervention.

Partial visual information was provided about a ball's path as it moved toward a hiding place. Children (2.0 and 2.5 years old) saw a ball rolling down a ramp placed behind a transparent screen with 4 opaque doors. A wall, placed on the ramp and directly behind 1 of the doors, protruded above the screen and stopped the ball. Children were asked to find the ball. The transparency of the screen permitted visual tracking of the ball between the doors, but its final resting place was obscured. Both age groups were equally proficient at tracking the ball as it rolled behind the screen, but the 2.5-year-olds were more likely to reach to the correct door. Looking behavior was related to errors in the younger group in that tracking that stopped short or continued past the correct door was associated with incorrect choices.

Premature birth interferes with typical exposition to visual, sensorimotor and proprioceptive stimulation, thus presumably affecting the development of body representations. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing the performance of preterm children with that of age-matched full-term children in two tasks assessing, respectively, visual body processing and body schema. We found that preterm children had spared configural processing but altered holistic processing of others’ bodies and showed a general difficulty in expressing visuospatial judgements on body stimuli. Furthermore, body-centered visuospatial abilities were associated with specific impairments in operating object-based visuospatial transformations. The findings of this study indicate that preterm birth might interfere with the development of body representations at the levels of body visual perceptual processing and of body schema, with effects even on visuo-spatial abilities for non-bodily stimuli. Body-centered rehabilitative interventions should be proposed to preterm children in order to enhance visuo-spatial abilities and higher-level cognitive functions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Neural plasticity	https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/1678984	Early brain damage leading to cerebral palsy is associated to core motor impairments and also affects cognitive and social abilities. In particular, previous studies  have documented specific alterations of perceptual body processing and motor  cognition that are associated to unilateral motor deficits in hemiplegic patients.  However, little is known about spastic diplegia (SpD), which is characterized by  motorial deficits involving both sides of the body and is often associated to  visuospatial, attentional, and social perception impairments. Here, we compared the  performance of a sample of 30 children and adolescents with SpD (aged 7-18 years)  and of a group of age-matched controls with typical development (TD) at two  different tasks tapping on body representations. In the first task, we tested visual  and motor imagery abilities as assessed, respectively, by the object-based mental  rotation of letters and by the first-person transformations for whole-body stimuli.  In the second task, we administered an inversion effect/composite illusion task to  evaluate the use of configural/holistic processing of others' body. Additionally, we  assessed social perception abilities in the SpD sample using the NEPSY-II battery.  In line with previously reported visuospatial deficits, a general mental imagery  impairment was found in SpD patients when they were engaged in both object-centered  and first-person mental transformations. Nevertheless, a specific deficit in  operating an own-body transformation emerged. As concerns body perception, while  more basic configural processing (i.e., inversion effect) was spared, no evidence  for holistic (i.e., composite illusion) body processing was found in the SpD group.  NEPSY-II assessment revealed that SpD children were impaired in both the theory of  mind and affect recognition subtests. Overall, these findings suggested that early  brain lesions and biased embodied experience could affect higher-level motor  cognition and perceptual body processing, thus pointing to a strict link between  motor deficits, body schema alterations, and person processing difficulties.

There are four types of childhood abuse that have been identified and discussed throughout this review: sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. In order for psychologists and other related professionals to recognize the contributions maltreatment has on psychiatric disorders, it is necessary to identify and understand the complex sequela of childhood abuse and neglect that may appear throughout the victim's lifespan. This paper reviewed current research on child maltreatment and its relationship to neurological impairments and neuropsychological effects. Additionally, a comparison between typical and impaired neurological morphology emphasized alterations in volumetric structures and stress response functions occurring in the HPA axis, amygdala, hippocampus, and corpus callosum. Recent studies have discovered that changes to the preceding neurological structures can significantly impact different neuropsychological domains including working memory, processing speed, language, visual-spatial abilities, and motor skills. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

While there is evidence linking T and C to different memory processes during adulthood, it remains unclear how the relative levels of T and C (TC ratio) may influence brain and behavioral development, whether they are influenced by sex of the child, and whether or not they occur as a result of stable changes in brain structure (organizational changes), as opposed to transient changes in brain function (activational changes). As such, we tested for associations among TC ratio, cortico-hippocampal structure, and standardized tests of executive, verbal, and visuo-spatial function in a longitudinal sample of typically developing 4-22-year-old children and adolescents. We found greater TC ratios to be associated with greater coordinated growth (i.e. covariance) between the hippocampus and cortical thickness in several areas primarily devoted to visual function. In addition, there was an age-related association between TC ratio and parieto-hippocampal covariance, as well as a sex-specific association between TC ratio and prefrontal-hippocampal covariance. Differences in brain structure related to TC ratio were in turn associated with lower verbal/executive function, as well as greater attention in tests of visuo-spatial abilities. These results support the notion that TC ratio may shift the balance between top-down (cortex to hippocampus) and bottom-up (hippocampus to cortex) processes, impairing more complex, cortical-based tasks and optimizing visuospatial tasks relying primarily on the hippocampus. © The Author(s), 2021.

database	Calam, R. M.	1983	journalArticle	Children's photograph selections and verbal reports in a spatial task.	Perception	https://doi.org/10.1068/p120599	The tendency for children to select a photograph of their own view of a scene when asked to represent the view seen by another observer in a different position has  been attributed to an egocentric view of the world. It seems likely, however, that  the egocentric response need not necessarily be related to the question of  sensitivity to the viewpoints of others. Rather, it may reflect the way in which  children treat two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional arrays in  mental-rotation tasks. In the present investigation, strong visual and verbal cues  were given for correct selection of a photograph of another observer's view in a  perspective-shift task. Justifications for choices were required. Whilst floor  effects were seen with children 3 to 4 years old, the responses of 8-year olds  polarised into a choice between the correct and egocentric view, as Freeman would  predict. Verbal justifications for these choices were mainly in terms of appropriate  content. After first selection, this chosen view was removed from the array.  Two-thirds of children who had chosen egocentrically then went on to choose  correctly on a second attempt. It is suggested that the egocentric response may form  an easier alternative for the child, but that the provision of such an alternative  may prevent the child from displaying the knowledge that he or she has.

International Journal of Behavioral Development	https://doi.org/10.1080/016502599383577	Fifty-one preschoolers' play preferences, skills at assembling block structures, and spatial abilities were recorded in this study. There were no sex differences in children's visual-spatial skills, and play with art materials and children's free and structured play with blocks were related to spatial visualisation. Two patterns emerged from the findings: (1) activity and performance representing skills in spatial visualisation and visual-motor coordination; and (2) creativity, or the ability to break set and to produce varied solutions using visual materials.

Design This prospective population-based study reports outcomes of 3-year-old children with CHD with or without open-heart surgery. Main outcome measures Standardised cognitive scores (mean scores and proportions below normative values) were assessed with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children II. We analysed demographic, perinatal and operative variables as predictors of cognitive outcomes. results 419 children participated (154 with open-heart surgery; 265 without surgery). Global cognitive scores did not differ between the groups. Compared with the non-operated group, children who underwent surgery obtained lower scores in expressive language (p=0.03) and logical reasoning (p=0.05). When compared with test norms, the frequency of global cognitive scores >1 SDs below the expected mean was higher in the surgical group (25% vs 16% in the general population) (p=0.03). A higher-than-expected proportion of children in the non-operated group scored >2 SDs below the expected mean (7% vs 2%) (p=0.05). Being small for gestational age (SGA) significantly increased the risk of cognitive impairment in the surgical group, after adjustments for multiple covariates including maternal education, complexity of the CHD and operative-related variables (adjusted OR=5.9; 95% CI (1.7 to 20.1)). conclusions Despite mean scores within the normative range, a high proportion of preschool children with CHD with or without surgery are at early cognitive risk. SGA is a strong predictor of the neurodevelopmental prognosis in CHD. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018. All rights reserved.

Each subject participated in a month-long lunar observation, received one of the four treatments, and responded to a test of logical thinking, a spatial rotational abilities test, a pretest, a posttest, and a retention test. The four treatments (Concrete/Internal, Semiconcrete/External, Semiabstract/External, and Abstract/External) employed models ranging from concrete to abstract with viewer perspective ranging from internal to external. Twenty-three randomly selected subjects were interviewed pre and post treatment.    Primary research questions examined were: Between treatment groups, would there be a difference in subjects' abilities to develop explanatory models? In the absence of a constructed concept, would there be differences in conceptual attainment between subjects and treatment groups? Would the level of spatial ability contribute to the subject's ability to explain observations? Would the level of reasoning ability affect the level of explanatory model development?    Chi Square analyses revealed significance $(p<.05)$ for Concrete/Internal and Semiabstract/External treatment groups and significance $(p<.01)$ for Semiconcrete/External treatment group between pretest and posttest explanatory model categories. There was no significant correlation between spatial rotational ability and model development. Only the Semiabstract/External treatment group measured a significant correlation between the level of logical thinking and model development. Analyses of interview data exposed several misconceptions: the moon and the sun "were the same thing", moon's rotation or tilt causes the phases, location on Earth would cause viewer to see different phases (even on the same day), orbital shape is an elongated oval, the moon and sun are "in" the Earth, Earth's shadow falling on the moon causes phases, clouds cause phases, sun gets between Earth and moon causing new moon or only allowing partial visibility, and the Earth's tilt causes the phases. Results suggest that (a) carefully selected physical models could aid in abstract concept development; and (b) teachers must probe to reveal "false positives" (correct vocabulary supported by incorrect ideas).

database	Calvo, Alejandra	2012	thesis	The role of bilingualism and socioeconomic status in executive functioning		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/role-bilingualism-socioeconomic-status-executive/docview/1112954670/se-2?accountid=11531	Research has shown that both life experience and environmental factors can modify cognitive performance by changing the way in which the human brain functions and develops . Two such influences that have been recently investigated are bilingualism and socioeconomic status (SES). A large body of research has demonstrated that performance on intelligence and achievement tests improves as SES increases (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). However, more recently, studies have shown that SES does not influence all cognitive abilities equally. Specifically, no differences between SES groups are found on visual or spatial ability but differences are consistently found on language and executive function processes, with lower scores obtained by children from low SES (Noble, Norman, & Farah, 2005). Research on bilingualism has demonstrated disadvantages in the verbal domain (e.g., vocabulary) and advantages in executive functioning (Bialystok, 2001). These are precisely the two areas that are impacted by SES. However, in spite of both experiences having a significant impact on the same cognitive processes, they have always been studied in isolation. In this study, the interaction of these two forces was examined in a 2x2 factorial design to determine not only how each affects cognitive performance independently but also their joint influence.    Participants (N=193) were bilingual and monolingual children (mean age= 80.5 months) whose mothers either had a postsecondary degree (middle class) or less than 12 years of education (working class). Children were assessed with a battery of tests which included measures of non-verbal reasoning, vocabulary, selective and visual attention and visuospatial working memory. As in previous research, bilinguals had lower performance in linguistic measures but better performance on measures of executive control than monolinguals. Similarly, middle class children had higher linguistic ability and better executive control than children from working class families. Importantly, independent of domain, there was no interaction between the two factors and a dissociation between SES and bilingualism with respect to the effect that they have on language and executive functioning emerged. For language ability, both an impoverished background and bilingualism resulted in parallel negative effects. For executive functioning, lower SES and bilingualism acted as opposing forces; bilingualism acted as a protective factor, whereas lower SES hindered children's performance. As such, the effects of bilingualism (both enhanced executive control and costs in linguistic measures) are seen in both middle and working class groups and consequently are not specific to children from certain socioeconomic backgrounds. Of interest, the performance of bilingual children from the working class on measures of executive functioning did not differ from that of middle class monolingual children. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Interact. Play	https://doi.org/10.1145/3450337.3483470	Augmented reality (AR) applications have shown to be extremely valuable for entertainment and educational purposes. AR experiences support the learning performance of scientific subjects by providing visualization of phenomena and abstract concepts. This process facilitates the transfer of 2D information into 3D mental models, a cognitive process essential in the Chemistry domain. In the pages that follow, we contribute to the design and development of two AR serious games that combine participatory design with human-computer interaction principles to introduce Periodic Table concepts to 9-13-year old children. We present initial findings regarding the children's acceptance and satisfaction of the games, usability, engagement and overall feedback from our target audience. Although the overall assessment showed positive results in AR's entertainment value and usability, a preliminary pilot test (N=7) using a mix-method approach identified the need for minor game-play interventions. We aim to optimize our games by continuing our research with our target audience, analyzing their feedback, making refinements and assessing the game's learning effectiveness. Our purpose is to research and create guidelines for designing AR serious games to facilitate the learning of abstract concepts while supporting spatial skills. We also aim to change student perception of Chemistry as challenging and dull, and to motivate children to invest in this area. © 2021 Owner/Author.

Children and adults with 22q.11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) often have poorer social competence as well as poorer performance on measures of executive and social-cognitive skills compared with typically developing young people. However, the relationship between social functioning and more basic processes of social cognition and executive functioning are not well understood in 22q11DS. The present study examined the relationship between social-cognitive measures of emotion attribution and theory of mind with executive functioning and their contribution to social competence in 22q11DS. Method: The present cross-sectional study measured social cognition and executive performance of 24 adolescents with 22q11DS compared with 27 age-matched typically developing controls. Social cognition was tested using the emotion attribution task (EAT) and a picture sequencing task (PST), which tested mentalising (false-belief), sequencing, cause and effect, and inhibition. Executive functioning was assessed using computerised versions of the Tower of London task and working memory measures of spatial and non-spatial ability. Social competence was also assessed using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: Adolescents with 22q11DS showed impaired false-belief, emotion attribution and executive functioning compared with typically developing control participants. Poorer performance was reported on all story types in the PST, although, patterns of errors and response times across story types were similar in both groups. General sequencing ability was the strongest predictor of false-belief, and performance on the false-belief task predicted emotion attribution accuracy. Intellectual functioning, rather than theory of mind or executive functioning, predicted social competence in 22q11DS. Conclusions: Performance on social-cognitive tasks of theory of mind indicate evidence of a general underlying dysfunction in 22q11DS that includes executive ability to understand cause and effect, to logically reason about social scenarios and also to inhibit responses to salient, but misleading cues. However, general intellectual ability is closely related to actual social competence suggesting that a generalised intellectual deficit coupled with more specific executive impairments may best explain poor social cognition in 22q11DS. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study investigated whether stereotype threat influences gender differences in performance on a novel test of visuospatial ability. Undergraduates (N = 194) were told that men outperform women on the test (explicit threat), were given no gender-relevant information (implicit threat), or were told that men and women do not differ (nullified stereotype). Although men outperformed women in the explicit and implicit stereotype threat groups, women's performance did not differ significantly from men's when told there is no gender difference. The effect was most pronounced for difficult line judgments. Although stereotypes regarding visuospatial ability may be less culturally salient than those of other cognitive abilities, these findings suggest that they influence performance nonetheless. Implications for optimizing cognitive test performance are discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Both of these tasks, as assessed in these studies, show median ages of onset between 7 and 9 months in normal infants, but very recent studies with normals have shown that, within this age group, locomotor experience, rather than age, forecasts the development of these skills. The specific question tested in this study concerned whether infants who were delayed in locomotor development due to meningomyelocele were also delayed in spatial skills until after the age at which locomotion was attained. The hypothesis was confirmed with both tasks. © 2009 Hogrefe Verlag Göttingen.	AE	0	0	0	1	0	0	0		SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		4	5	0	4	4	0	0	1

Less is known about the mental transformations that non-humans can perform over approximate quantities, such as arithmetic transformations. There is evidence that human symbolic arithmetic has a deep psychological connection with the primitive, approximate forms of quantification of non-human animals. Here, we ask whether the subtle performance signatures that humans exhibit during symbolic arithmetic also bear a connection to primitive arithmetic. Specifically, we examined the problem size effect, the tie effect, and the practice effect—effects which are commonly observed in children’s math performance in school. We show that, like humans, monkeys exhibited the problem size and tie effects, indicating commonalities in arithmetic algorithms with humans. Unlike humans, however, monkeys did not exhibit a practice effect. Together, these findings provide new evidence for a cognitive relation between non-symbolic and symbolic arithmetic. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

In children with Down Syndrome (DS), FMS development is delayed, which has been suggested to be associated with balance deficits. This study therefore examined the relationship between FMS proficiency and balance ability in children with DS, with the aim of contributing evidence to programmes that address FMS delay. Methods: Participants consisted of 20 children with DS (7.1 ± 2.9 years old) and an age-matched control group of children with typical development (7.25 ± 2.5 years). In the first part of the study, FMS (i.e. locomotor and object control) proficiency of the children was tested using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2. Balance ability was assessed using a force platform to measure centre of pressure average velocity (AV; mm/sec), path length (mm), medio-lateral standard deviation (mm) and antero-posterior standard deviation (mm). In the second part of the study, children with DS participated in 5 weeks of FMS training. FMS proficiency and balance ability were tested post-training and compared to pre-training scores. Verbal and visuo-spatial short-term memory capacities were measured at pre-training to verify the role of working memory in skill learning. Results: FMS proficiency was associated with centre of pressure parameters in children with DS but not in children with typical development. After controlling for age, AV was found to predict significant variance in locomotor (R2 = 0.61, P &lt; 0.001) and object control (R2 = 0.69, P &lt; 0.001) scores. FMS proficiency and mastery improved after FMS training, as did AV, path length and antero-posterior standard deviation (all P &lt; 0.05). Verbal and visuo-spatial short-term memory did not interact with the effects of training. Conclusions: Children with DS who have better balance ability tend to have more proficient FMS. Skill-specific training improved not only FMS sub-skills but static balance stability as well. Working memory did not play a role in the changes caused by skills training. Future research should examine the causal relationship between balance and FMS. © 2017 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A Multilevel Critique With New Data	American Psychologist	https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.40.7.786	The notion that males are superior to females in performance of spatial tasks has been widely accepted. However, serious problems exist in this area in terms of the generally small size and inconsistency of sex differences, difficulties in individual studies and in two different kinds of reviews of the research, the lack of consensus about definition, and the paucity of evidence that "spatial abilities" is a legitimate construct. Because of these problems, particularly those related to the construct, the conclusion that males are superior is unwarranted. Indeed, the fundamental issue of the legitimacy of the construct is discussed. © 1985 American Psychological Association.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Nevertheless, maternal care could be not the solely responsible for changing offspring developmental trajectories. To disentangle the specific contribution to the transgenerational inheritance of pre- and post-natal factors, a cross-fostering study was performed. Female rats were reared in an enriched environment from weaning to sexual maturity, while control female rats were reared under standard conditions. Following mating with standard-reared males, all females were housed individually. Immediately after delivery, in- or cross-fostering manipulations were performed so that any foster dams received pups born to another dam of the same (in-fostering) or the opposite (cross-fostering) pre-reproductive rearing condition. In lactating dams maternal care and nesting activities were assessed, while in their male pups spatial abilities were assessed through Morris Water Maze (MWM) test at post-natal day 45. Moreover, the expression of Brain-Derived-Neurotrophic-Factor (BDNF) was evaluated in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of dams and pups at weaning. Pre-reproductive maternal environmental enrichment, followed by adoption procedures, loosened its potential in modifying maternal care and offspring developmental trajectories, as indicated by the lack of differences between in-fostered groups of dams and pups. In addition, enriched dams rearing standard pups showed the least complex maternal repertoire (the highest sniffing duration and the lowest nest quality), and their pups showed a reduced spatial learning in the MWM. Nevertheless, pre-reproductive maternal enrichment kept influencing neurotrophic pattern, with enriched dams expressing increased frontal BDNF levels (regardless of the kind of fostered pups), and their offspring expressing increased hippocampal BDNF levels. The present findings enlighten the crucial importance of the early mother-pups interactions in influencing maternal care and offspring phenotype, with the enriched dam-standard pups couple resulting in the most maladaptive encounter. Our study thus sustains that the bidirectional interactions between mother and pups are able to deeply shape offspring phenotype. © 2015 Caporali, Cutuli, Gelfo, Laricchiuta, Foti, De Bartolo, Angelucci and Petrosini.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00467	The specific role of early visual deprivation on spatial hearing is still unclear, mainly due to the difficulty of comparing similar spatial skills at different ages  and to the difficulty in recruiting young blind children from birth. In this study,  the effects of early visual deprivation on the development of auditory spatial  localization have been assessed in a group of seven 3-5 years old children with  congenital blindness (n = 2; light perception or no perception of light) or low  vision (n = 5; visual acuity range 1.1-1.7 LogMAR), with the main aim to understand  if visual experience is fundamental to the development of specific spatial skills.  Our study led to three main findings: firstly, totally blind children performed  overall more poorly compared sighted and low vision children in all the spatial  tasks performed; secondly, low vision children performed equally or better than  sighted children in the same auditory spatial tasks; thirdly, higher residual levels  of visual acuity are positively correlated with better spatial performance in the  dynamic condition of the auditory localization task indicating that the more  residual vision the better spatial performance. These results suggest that early  visual experience has an important role in the development of spatial cognition,  even when the visual input during the critical period of visual calibration is  partially degraded like in the case of low vision children. Overall these results  shed light on the importance of early assessment of spatial impairments in visually  impaired children and early intervention to prevent the risk of isolation and social  exclusion.

Frontiers in human neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00208	Despite its impact on everyday functioning, spatial perspective-taking has rarely been investigated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and previous findings are  surprisingly sparse and inconsistent. In the present study, we aimed to investigate  spatial perspective-taking abilities in children and adolescents with ASD without  intellectual disabilities, comparing them with a group of typically developing (TD)  peers. Our objectives were: (i) to test similarities and differences between these  groups in a spatial perspective-taking task; and (ii) to see whether similar or  different underlying processes (i.e., fine and gross motor skills, and visuospatial  abilities) might account for the groups' performance in the spatial  perspective-taking task. A group of children with ASD (N = 36) was compared with a  TD group (N = 39), aged from 8 to 16 years. Participants were administered tasks  assessing spatial perspective-taking, fine and gross motor skills,  visuo-constructive abilities, visuospatial working memory, visual imagery, and  mental rotation. Our results revealed that the ASD group had more difficulty with  the spatial perspective-taking task than the TD group. The two groups also had some  shared and some different processes that predicted their perspective-taking  performance: a significant predictive effect of fine motor skills and visuospatial  working memory emerged for both groups, while gross motor skills (i.e., walking  heel-to-toe) and visuospatial imagery only revealed a role in the TD group. These  findings suggest that different abilities might account for the two groups'  performance in the spatial perspective-taking task. Gross motor skills and complex  visuospatial abilities seem to be more important in sustaining spatial  perspective-taking ability in typical development than in the event of ASD. Some of  the clinical and educational implications of these findings are discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Current opinion in neurology	https://doi.org/10.1097/WCO.0000000000000077	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The notion that play may facilitate learning has long been touted. Here, we review how video game play may be leveraged for enhancing  attentional control, allowing greater cognitive flexibility and learning and in turn  new routes to better address developmental disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Video games,  initially developed for entertainment, appear to enhance the behavior in domains as  varied as perception, attention, task switching, or mental rotation. This  surprisingly wide transfer may be mediated by enhanced attentional control, allowing  increased signal-to-noise ratio and thus more informed decisions. SUMMARY: The  possibility of enhancing attentional control through targeted interventions, be it  computerized training or self-regulation techniques, is now well established.  Embedding such training in video game play is appealing, given the astounding amount  of time spent by children and adults worldwide with this media. It holds the promise  of increasing compliance in patients and motivation in school children, and of  enhancing the use of positive impact games. Yet for all the promises, existing  research indicates that not all games are created equal: a better understanding of  the game play elements that foster attention and learning as well as of the  strategies developed by the players is needed. Computational models from machine  learning or developmental robotics provide a rich theoretical framework to develop  this work further and address its impact on developmental disorders.

Two main questions are addressed: (1) Is reading an island of ability in DS? and (2) What are the cognitive correlates of word reading ability in DS? In particular, how do language versus visual-spatial skills relate to individual differences in reading ability in DS? Participants were 19 individuals with DS, ranging in age from 10 to 19 years, and 19 typically developing children (mean age = 4.9 years) matched with the DS individuals for mental age. Overall, reading ability in DS was very poor. There was no evidence that reading represents an "island of ability" in DS; instead, the average reading level of DS participants was even lower than would be predicted by their IQ. However, there were substantial individual differences in literacy among DS participants. DS word reading and spelling skill correlated strongly with the ability to read by phonological recoding. It also correlated with several language measures. As a matter of fact, the often reported language-mental age gap was found only among the poor readers with DS. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development	https://doi.org/10.2307/1166011	This study examined the relationship between the antecedent everyday experiences of middle-class children in middle-class day-care centers and their intellectual development assessed by the Binet and tests of Spatial Abilities and Receptive Language at age 3. As in the previous study of children in home care, certain types of experiences were hypothesized in advance to be intellectually valuable in that they seemed to provide the clearest opportunities for the child to learn the skills required for successful test performance. The study demonstrated that these experiences were indeed uniquely intellectually valuable in that (apart from preparatory, planful activities) they comprised the only category of everyday experiences that predicted test scores. The research then compared the predictive power of various combinations of sources and topics of intellectual experiences. As expected from the home-care results, language-mastery experiences provided by caregivers when the child was 18--33 months old were clearly the most valuable type of intellectual experiences in predicting test scores at age 3. This subset of intellectual experiences stood out as the strongest predictor of IQ in day care. Performance on the Spatial Abilities and Receptive Language tests was also significantly predicted by language-mastery experiences but here, in contrast to IQ, other types of interactive experiences in which the child played a more prominent role vis-à-vis the caregiver and also experiences which focused on the acquisition of skills other than language were beneficial. The critical importance of intellectually stimulating interaction with caregivers was highlighted by the finding that, of the six combinations of sources and topics of intellectual experiences that proved predictive of test scores, four referred to experiences occurring in interactive situations in which the child are caregiver jointly created the intellectual experiences or in which the caregiver unilaterally structured the experiences for the child. By comparison, intellectual experiences that the child generated for himself in solitary play explained little of the variance in test performance. In sum, this study strongly suggested that, by reciprocally or unilaterally providing various forms of intellectual stimulation and especially experiences designed to foster the mastery of language, caregivers may play a essential, --at least insofar as the 3-year-old's intellectual competence is validly assessed by measures like IQ. Why teachers provided more of this stimulation to some children than others was not clear. Their differential treatment seems to have been guided in part by perceptions of individual intellectual development and especially language competence, but, as in the home-care study, their behavior also seems to have been affected by many other unmeasured factors.

Also, the use of augmented reality allows to improve the interactive and spatial skills with three-dimensional objects. A mobile interactive augmented reality system with 3D models was developed for the teaching of geometry, allowing the teacher to obtain real-time results of the student’s spatial and mathematical competence in a real-world environment. In the mobile system, a playful environment capable of visualizing geometric figures (Cube, Rectangular Prism, Triangular Prism, Pyramid, Cone, Cylinder and Sphere), and formulas to calculate its volume are proposed. After learning the formulas, the student must continue with the game and obtain the highest score without visualizing the formulas in such a way that in a competitive environment they can experience more realistic and beneficial learning to improve their spatial competence. The students evaluated are in the primary level (sixth grade) of two classrooms in the city of Arequipa, Peru, enrolled in a one-week course (4 h a week) entitled “Mathematical Logic”, and divided into a experimental group (they used Voluminis) and a control group (traditional methodology). A performance test (post-test) and a satisfaction questionnaire were used. In addition, a pre-test to both groups to determine the same level of knowledge about spatial geometry. The results revealed a positive impact on performance, greater academic motivation of students and above all increased competition among students in the Voluminis game. Thanks to the results in real time the professor observed the learning difficulties of the students and obtained the immediate qualifications of the space competition. Voluminis can be part of the qualified evaluation of the course, because it provides the evolution of each student in the area of geometry. It also helps to strengthen space skills thanks to the competition activities that occur in the game. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Neuropsychologia	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.08.015	This series of experiments was aimed at assessing spatial abilities in high functioning individuals with autism (HFA), using a human-size labyrinth. In the context of recent findings that the performance of individuals with HFA was superior to typically developing individuals in several non-social cognitive operations, it was expected that the HFA group would outperform a typically developing comparison group matched on full-scale IQ. Results showed that individuals with autism performed all spatial tasks at a level at least equivalent to the typically developing comparison group. No differences between groups were found in route and survey tasks. Superior performance for individuals with HFA was found in tasks involving maps, in the form of superior accuracy in graphic cued recall of a path, and shorter learning times in a map learning task. We propose that a superior ability to detect [Human Perception and Performance 27 (3) (2001) 719], match [Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry 34 (1993) 1351] and reproduce [Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry 40 (5) (1999) 743] simple visual elements yields superior performance in tasks relying on the detection and graphic reproduction of the visual elements composing a map. Enhanced discrimination, detection, and memory for visually simple patterns in autism may account for the superior performance of persons with autism on visuo-spatial tasks that heavily involve pattern recognition, either in the form of recognizing and memorizing landmarks or in detecting the similarity between map and landscape features. At a neuro-anatomical level, these findings suggest an intact dorso-lateral pathway, and enhanced performance in non social tasks relying on the infero-temporal pathway. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of the importance of iron in the brain, iron deficiency results in widespread and lasting effects on behavior and cognition. We measured iron in the basal ganglia of young children using a novel MRI method, quantitative susceptibility mapping, and examined the association of brain iron with age and cognitive performance. Participants were a community sample of 39 young children recruited from pediatric primary care who were participating in a 5-year longitudinal study of child brain development and anxiety disorders. The children were ages 7 to 11 years old (mean age: 9.5 years old) at the time of the quantitative susceptibility mapping scan. The differential abilities scale was administered when the children were 6 years old to provide a measure of general intelligence and verbal (receptive and expressive), non-verbal, and spatial performance. Magnetic susceptibility values, which are linearly related to iron concentration in iron-rich areas, were extracted from regions of interest within iron-rich deep gray matter nuclei from the basal ganglia, including the caudate, putamen, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and thalamus. Controlling for scan age, there was a significant positive association between iron in the basal ganglia and spatial IQ, with this effect being driven by iron in the right caudate We also replicated previous findings of a significant positive association between iron in the bilateral basal ganglia and age. Our finding of a positive association between spatial IQ and mean iron in the basal ganglia, and in the caudate specifically, suggests that iron content in specific regions of the iron-rich deep nuclei of the basal ganglia influences spatial intelligence. This provides a potential neurobiological mechanism linking deficits in spatial abilities reported in children who were severely iron deficient as infants to decreased iron within the caudate. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Two hundred and forty-one second grade students from seven schools in Northeast Georgia participated in the study. In fall of the second grade, children were assessed on computation strategies, spatial ability, confidence in mathematics, and accuracy and fluency. In spring, the children took a mathematics competency test. Regression analyses indicated that fluency, accuracy and cognitive strategy use predicted mathematics competency scores. Gender differences were most evident in fluency and the types of strategies used suggesting that it is these variables that influence the emergence of gender differences in math competency. In examining the highest performing group, gender differences in manipulative strategy use were more pronounced in comparison to the total sample, but cognitive strategies were linked to test performance. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12753	Through five waves of data collection, this longitudinal study investigated the development of spatial skills in 304 elementary school children (M(age)  = 7.64 years) as they progressed from the second to fourth grade. The study focused  on whether multiple latent classes with different developmental profiles best  explain development. Spatial skills were measured by tests featuring two-dimensional  figures. Mathematics achievement was measured by the statewide end-of-year test and  was included as a distal outcome variable. The role of covariates, including  socioeconomic status, verbal working memory, and gender, was also explored. The  results indicate a need to view two-dimensional spatial skills development as  multidimensional with two developmental profiles predicted by socioeconomic status,  verbal working memory, and gender.

This study examined how spatial skills influenced the development of number sense, and subsequent mathematics competency, as students progressed from the 2nd to the 4th grade. Gender, verbal working memory (VWM), and socioeconomic status (SES) have also been found to predict number sense development and to be linked to spatial skills; as such, they were included as covariates in this study. Participants were 304 second graders who were assessed at 5 points between 2nd and 4th grade. Two growth mixture models (spatial skills as time-invariant and time-variant covariates) were tested to determine whether different developmental trajectories were needed to explain the development of number sense. Both models revealed the presence of 2 latent classes. The classes differed in their initial level and in their growth rate, with the higher performing class beginning the second grade at an advantage and increasing that advantage over time. SES, VWM, and spatial skills influenced latent class membership and subsequent mathematics competency. SES, spatial skills, and VWM, but not gender, predicted the intercept but differences were found in predictors of the slope of number sense. The impact of number sense changed over time and differed as a function of latent class having an earlier impact on the higher performing class.

Psychoneuroendocrinology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.02.010	There is strong evidence of sex differences in mental rotation tasks. Transsexualism is an extreme gender identity disorder in which individuals seek cross-gender  treatment to change their sex. The aim of our study was to investigate if  male-to-female (MF) and female-to-male (FM) transsexuals receiving cross-sex  hormonal treatment have different patterns of cortical activation during a  three-dimensional (3D) mental rotation task. An fMRI study was performed using a 3-T  scan in a sample of 18 MF and 19 FM under chronic cross-sex hormonal treatment.  Twenty-three males and 19 females served as controls. The general pattern of  cerebral activation seen while visualizing the rotated and non-rotated figures was  similar for all four groups showing strong occipito-parieto-frontal brain  activation. However, compared to control males, the activation of MF transsexuals  during the task was lower in the superior parietal lobe. Compared to control  females, MF transsexuals showed higher activation in orbital and right dorsolateral  prefrontal regions and lower activation in the left prefrontal gyrus. FM  transsexuals did not differ from either the MF transsexual or control groups.  Regression analyses between cerebral activation and the number of months of hormonal  treatment showed a significant negative correlation in parietal, occipital and  temporal regions in the MF transsexuals. No significant correlations with time were  seen in the FM transsexuals. In conclusion, although we did not find a specific  pattern of cerebral activation in the FM transsexuals, we have identified a specific  pattern of cerebral activation during a mental 3D rotation task in MF transsexuals  under cross-sex hormonal treatment that differed from control males in the parietal  region and from control females in the orbital prefrontal region. The hypoactivation  in MF transsexuals in the parietal region could be due to the hormonal treatment or  could reflect a priori cerebral differences between MF transsexual and control  subjects.

BMJ (Clinical research ed.)	https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.d4473	OBJECTIVE: To investigate how pregnancy planning, time to conception, and infertility treatment influence cognitive development at ages 3 and 5. DESIGN:  Prospective population based cohort study. SETTING: Millennium Cohort Study in the  United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 18,818 children recruited at 9 months and followed up  at 3 and 5 years. 11,790 singletons with available data on pregnancy, cognitive  outcomes, and confounders were included in analyses at age 3 and 12,136 at age 5.  Exposure measures Mothers reported whether the pregnancy was planned, and their  feelings when first pregnant; those in whom the pregnancy was planned provided time  to conception, and details of any assisted reproductive technologies. The population  was divided into "unplanned" (unplanned and unhappy), "mistimed" (unplanned but  happy), "planned" (planned, time to conception <12 months), "subfertile" (planned,  time to conception ≥ 12 months), "induced ovulation" (received clomiphene citrate),  and "assisted reproduction" (in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm  injection). The "planned" group was the comparison group in all analyses. OUTCOME  MEASURES: Three components of the British Ability Scales (BAS II). Naming vocabulary  assessed verbal ability at age 3; this test was repeated at age 5 with the picture  similarities and pattern construction subscales, which measure non-verbal and  spatial abilities. RESULTS: In unadjusted analyses, the scores on all scales in  children from unplanned pregnancies were significantly lower than in those from  planned pregnancies-for example, the difference in mean verbal ability score at age  3 was -4.8 (95% confidence interval -6.0 to -3.7; P<0.05), equivalent to an average  delay of four months. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors these  differences were attenuated: -0.3 (-1.3 to 0.7), equivalent to no delay. Children  born after assisted reproduction performed consistently better in verbal ability  tests (3.8 (-0.2 to 7.9) at age 3 and 3.5 (0.2 to 6.8) at age 5), which suggests  that on average these children are three to four months ahead; this difference did  not completely disappear with adjustment for confounders. Children born after  infertility treatment had lower mean scores in non-verbal tests (-1.2 (-4.1 to 1.6)  after assisted reproduction and -1.5 (-3.5 to 0.4) after induced ovulation) and in  spatial ability tests (-2.7 (-6.9 to 1.6) after assisted reproduction), though the  differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy planning, subfertility, or  assisted reproduction do not adversely affect children's cognitive development at  age 3 or 5. The differences observed in the unadjusted analyses are almost entirely  explained by marked inequalities in socioeconomic circumstances between the groups.

More specifically, the study focused on visuo-spatial working memory and arithmetic ability (Baddeley and Hitch, 1974). A longitudinal study examined a group of children at age 4- to  5- years who were tested again at 6- to 7-years, and a cross sectional study examined a group of children aged 10- to 11-years. All children were tested on a battery of measures to assess the three main components of working memory (central executive, phonological loop and visuo-spatial sketchpad) along with measures of reading and arithmetic ability. Analyses addressed the concurrent impact of working memory skills on arithmetic ability for the three age groups (4- to 5-years, 6- to 7- years and 10- to 11- years), and the predictive relationship between earlier working memory skills (4- to 5- years) on later arithmetic ability (6- to 7-years) controlling for age and reading ability. In the concurrent analyses, measures of visuo-spatial ability were the strongest predictors of arithmetic ability in children aged 6- to 7- years and 10- to 11-years of age. Following this, a measure of central executive ability was found to further add to prediction of arithmetic ability. Measures of phonological ability did not predict arithmetic ability. Similarly, analyses of the longitudinal data showed that a measure of visuo-spatial ability (but not central executive or phonological ability) at 4- to 5 -years predicted arithmetic ability at 6- to 7-years. By contrast, the concurrent analyses at age 4- to 5- years showed that measures of central executive ability and phonological ability, but not visuo-spatial ability, predicted arithmetic ability at 4- to 5- years. It is suggested that the finding that visuo-spatial skills were not related to arithmetic ability in the very young age group may reflect different arithmetic task demands for the youngest children compared to the older children. The study showed that the component of working memory most strongly related to arithmetic ability in 6- to 7- year olds and 10- to 11-years was the visuo-spatial sketchpad.

Advances in child development and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.acdb.2017.10.007	Early in development infants form categorical representations of small-scale spatial relations, such as left vs right and above vs below. This spatial skill allows  infants to experience coherence in the layout of the objects in their environment  and to note the equivalence of a spatial relation across changes in objects.  Comparisons across studies of infant spatial categorization offer insight into the  processes that contribute to the development of this skill. Rather than viewing  contrasting results across studies as contradictory, identifying how infant spatial  categorization tasks recruit distinct processes can not only reconcile findings but  also yield insight into the starting points, development, and emerging nature of  infants' representations of spatial relations. Also, situating infants' spatial  categorization in the context of advances in nonspatial domains may reveal  synergistic relations among these domains, particularly in relation to advances in  infants' manipulative play with objects and their acquisition of spatial language. A  central argument is that broadening the study of infants' spatial categorization may  yield further insights into the nature of early spatial concepts and the processes  that promote their development.

Four-year-old children (N = 50) were randomly assigned to a play-only (n = 24) or a spatial-language and play condition (n = 26). Their mental rotation and spatial vocabulary were assessed at baseline and several days after 5 play sessions. Children in the spatial-language condition scored higher at posttest on a mental rotation task than those in the play-only condition. The amount and diversity of experimenter spatial language during the play sessions accounted for a significant amount of the variance on children’s posttest mental rotation. Significant gains in mental rotation were replicated in a second study (N = 34) with a broader range of play activities and with children enrolled in Head Start. These results show that the facilitative effects of spatial language on spatial cognition are not restricted to the context in which the spatial language is provided. In particular, 4-year-old children’s experience with spatial language during play can transfer to promote their mental rotation.

Neurology	https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000129533.26544.bf	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether memory loss is detectable before the symptomatic presentation of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in those at greater genetic risk for  Alzheimer disease (AD) based upon presence or absence of the e4 allele of APOE.  METHODS: Participants were age 50 years or older who responded to newspaper  advertisements. A total of 212 cognitively normal individuals of known APOE genotype  were initially enrolled in a match paradigm that included e4 homozygotes, e3/4  heterozygotes, and e4 noncarriers in a 1:1:2 ratio (53 sets). Of the original 212  individually matched participants, 180 completed at least two epochs of testing  including 45 APOE e4/4 homozygotes, 42 APOE e3/4 heterozygotes, and 93 APOE e4  noncarriers, mean age 60 (+/-6.2) years. Of these, four developed MCI or AD during  the follow-up period and were excluded from analysis. Longitudinal  neuropsychological study included two verbal (Auditory Verbal Learning Test [AVLT],  Selective Reminding Test [SRT]) and two visual (Complex Figure Test [CFT], Visual  Retention Test) memory tests. RESULTS: Multiple measures on both verbal memory tests  showed poorer performance over a mean interval of 33 months in e4 carriers than  noncarriers: AVLT total learning, long term delayed recall; SRT free and cued  recall. Among those age 50 to 59 years, AVLT long term delayed recall, SRT free and  cued recall, and CFT recall declined more in APOE e4 carriers. No differences were  found in the domains of language, spatial skills, or executive function.  CONCLUSIONS: Memory declined in APOE e4 carriers before the symptomatic presentation  of MCI in a cohort whose mean age was 60 years over a median period of 33 months.  The decline began prior to age 60.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Two intervention conditions and a control condition were included to determine, first, whether the block building activities themselves benefited children's spatial skills, and secondly, whether a story context further improved learning. Spatial measures included: spatial visualization, mental rotation, and block building. Results showed: for block building, interventions within a story context improved performance compared to the other two conditions. For spatial visualization, both types of block-building interventions improved performance compared to the control condition. Findings suggest: (1) storytelling provides an effective context for teaching spatial content, (2) teaching block building develops wider spatial skills, and (3) 3-dimensional mental rotation tasks show a male advantage in kindergartners.

The study was designed to determine the relationship between maternal supportive interactions on a joint origami spatial problem-solving task and their first grade daughters' spatial and arithmetic skills. During home visits the mothers and daughters were videotaped jointly solving origami tasks with maternal supportive interactions assessed through ratings of maternal stimulation of cognitive development and maternal quality of assistance; the girls were separately assessed in school on spatial and arithmetic skills. Using structural equation modeling, the main findings were (1) maternal supportive interactions on a mother-child origami task mediated the relation between mothers' spatial skills/educational level and their daughters' spatial skills and (2) their daughters' spatial skills in turn mediated the relation between quality of maternal supportive spatial interactions and the daughters' arithmetic achievement. The present findings indicate the importance of early maternal supportive interactions relating to spatial problem solving for girls' spatial and arithmetic achievement. Furthermore, all pathways linking girls' home environments and arithmetic skills were mediated through the girls' spatial skills, suggesting that for young girls, development of early spatial skills may be important for effective arithmetic learning. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Predictors of 2 subtypes of measurement performance (spatial-conceptual and formula based) were assessed while controlling for verbal and spatial working memory. Consistent with prior findings, students from the affluent community outperformed students from the low-income community on all measures examined. More importantly, the study revealed different patterns of relations between cognitive skills and academic performance in the 2 communities. Specifically, spatial skills were related to measurement performance in the affluent but not in the low-income community. These findings demonstrate that socioeconomic context impacts not only children's levels of performance but also their capacity to apply basic cognitive skills, like spatial reasoning, to their academic performance. © 2011 American Psychological Association.

First-grade assessments included spatial skills, verbal skills, addition/subtraction skills, and frequency of choice of a decomposition or retrieval strategy on the addition/subtraction problems. In fifth grade, girls were given an arithmetic fluency test, a mental rotation spatial task, and a numeric and algebra math reasoning test. Using structural equation modeling, the estimated path model accounted for 87% of the variance in math reasoning. First-grade spatial skills had a direct pathway to fifth-grade math reasoning as well as an indirect pathway through first-grade decomposition strategy use. The total effect of first-grade spatial skills was significantly higher in predicting fifth-grade math reasoning than all other predictors. First-grade decomposition strategy use had the second strongest total effect, while retrieval strategy use did not predict fifth-grade math reasoning. It was first-grade spatial skills (not fifth-grade) that directly predicted fifth-grade math reasoning. Consequently, the results support the importance of early spatial skills in predicting later math. As expected, decomposition strategy use in first grade was linked to fifth-grade math reasoning indirectly through first-grade arithmetic accuracy and fifth-grade arithmetic fluency. However, frequency of first-grade decomposition use also showed a direct pathway to fifth-grade arithmetic reasoning, again stressing the importance of these early cognitive processes on later math reasoning. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

For the girls with brothers, those from all right-handed families had lower mental rotation scores than did the other girls. For the 2nd cohort, among those children who participated in mental-rotation-type activities with their brothers, both boys and girls from all right-handed families performed more poorly on the mental rotation test than did the other children with brothers. Thus, compared with other children, the children from all right-handed families do not appear to be able to use their spatial experiences with male siblings to increase their spatial skills.

Although there was no difference in absolute levels of performance as a function of either sex or handedness, predictive structures did differ. Regression analyses showed that spatial ability predicts math achievement for: (1) girls with anomalous dominance (non-right- handers and right-handers with non-right-handed relatives), and (2) all boys (independent of handedness group). In contrast, for the standard dominance girls who are right-handed with all right- handed relatives (considered strongly left-hemisphere dominant for language), spatial ability did not predict for math achievement. These findings occurred, even when scholastic aptitude and verbal achievement factors were controlled. It was concluded that further studies of sex differences in math achievement should consider subgroup differences within the sexes, based on handedness patterns. © 1992.

Using computer-animated stimuli similar to the “live” stimuli used by Baillargeon and her colleagues (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon et al., 1985), 48 8-month-old infants were habituated to 1 of 4 computer-animated events and then tested on all 4 events. The events involved a screen that rotated in either a 180° or 120° arc*** and a block that either was sitting in the path of the rotating screen or absent from the event. The results provided no evidence that infants responded on the basis of the possibility or impossibility of the events as claimed by Baillargeon and her colleagues, but instead indicated that the infants responded on the basis of perceptual novelty. These results are consistent with the findings of Schilling (this issue) and Bogartz, Shinskey, and Schilling (this issue). Taken together, along with the findings of Rivera, Wakeley, and Langer (1999), these more recent findings suggest that Baillargeon's (1987; Baillargeon et al., 1985) results should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of object permanence in very young infants.

Despite the fact that the term "Mozart effect" has been grossly misapplied and over-exaggerated, the effects of music on intelligence have caught the interest of scientists concerned with cognitive, neuroscientific, and educational approaches to the study of music. This chapter addresses the question, "How does music learning affect other intellectual capacities?" We review research on the effects of music instruction on spatial abilities and arithmetic, followed by an examination of its effects on other cognitive skills, including visual-motor integration and verbal/reading performance. After suggesting some possible mechanisms for these effects, we then discuss a widely-publicized paper suggesting that music instruction enhances general intelligence (IQ). We revisit the data from this study to investigate if the reported IQ gains were driven by one of the two sub-domains measured, i.e., visual-spatial reasoning or verbal reasoning. We conclude from our analyses that the gains in general intelligence derive from gains in visual-spatial reasoning skills more than from gains in verbal skills-for all children and particularly for children who scored low on the IQ test prior to musical instruction. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The authors develop a framework to delineate possible causal pathways and evaluate evidence for each. Biological evidence is contradictory and inconclusive. Although cross-cultural and cross-cohort differences suggest a powerful effect of sociocultural context, evidence for specific factors is inconsistent and contradictory. Factors unique to underrepresentation in math-intensive fields include the following: (a) Math-proficient women disproportionately prefer careers in non-math-intensive fields and are more likely to leave math-intensive careers as they advance; (b) more men than women score in the extreme math-proficient range on gatekeeper tests, such as the SAT Mathematics and the Graduate Record Examinations Quantitative Reasoning sections; (c) women with high math competence are disproportionately more likely to have high verbal competence, allowing greater choice of professions; and (d) in some math-intensive fields, women with children are penalized in promotion rates. The evidence indicates that women's preferences, potentially representing both free and constrained choices, constitute the most powerful explanatory factor; a secondary factor is performance on gatekeeper tests, most likely resulting from sociocultural rather than biological causes. © 2009 American Psychological Association.

Polymorphisms of genes related to androgen metabolism, however, have not been previously analyzed in association with spatial abilities. Our study analyzes genetic polymorphisms of androgen receptor (AR), aromatase (CYP19), and 5-alpha reductase (SRD5A2) in relation to mental rotation and spatial visualization in prepubertal intellectually gifted boys. DNA samples of 36 boys with an average age of 10.0 ± 0.7 years and an IQ higher than 130 were isolated from buccal cells in saliva. DNA was subsequently used for amplification by PCR. The CYP19 C¹⁵⁵⁸-T polymorphism and SRD5A2 A49T polymorphism were determined by RFLP analysis, and the AR (CAG)n polymorphism was determined by fragment analysis. Salivary testosterone levels were measured with radioimmunoassay. Spatial abilities (mental rotation and spatial visualization) were assessed using standard psychometric tests. AR and CYP19 polymorphisms were not associated with spatial abilities. Heterozygotes in A49T polymorphisms (AT) of SRD5A2 had significantly better results in both mental rotation and spatial visualization tests compared to AA homozygotes. TT homozygotes were not found. The T allele of A49T polymorphism of the SRD5A2 was reported to have a 5-fold increased activity in comparison to the A allele. AT heterozygotes outscored AA homozygotes in tests of spatial performance. Since dihydrotestosterone—the product of 5-alpha reductase catalyzed reaction—has a higher affinity to AR, this might indicate a potential molecular mechanism for the influence of SRD5A2 polymorphism on spatial abilities in intellectually gifted prepubertal boys.

However, very few studies have sought to examine the longitudinal development of the relation between drawing and visuospatial ability. The current investigation explored change in drawing and visuospatial skill in art students taking a foundational drawing course (N = 42) in a longitudinal design. Measures of representational drawing skill, dispositional traits, and visuospatial skill were taken at three time points over the course of 5 months. The findings reveal improvements in representational drawing, mental rotation, disembedding figures, and attentional switching. However, individual differences in change over time on one task did not predict change in another, revealing implications for domain-specific and domain-general aspects of art and design expertise.

Item difficulty estimates and person ability estimates located on the same logit scale revealed that the pooled sample of Chinese students, who were relatively highly able, might find it relatively easy to complete the IFT, and there might be relatively fewer number of items at the higher end than at the lower end of the item difficulty scale. The substantial correlation between person ability estimates and external criterion measures (mental rotation test scores and judged drawing scores) provided support for the validity of the IFT in identifying visual-spatial talents among students. Implications of the findings for the use and the future development or refinement of the IFT are discussed. Putting the Research to Use Assessing and identifying visual-spatial talents in students is important as a first step to support and enhance their optimal talent development. This study provides supporting evidence that the rapid recognition of impossible figures using the Impossible Figures Task (IFT) could be indicative of students' global visual-spatial ability. Thus, the IFT could be used as a part of a more comprehensive assessment protocol for students. Specifically, based on the present Rasch scaling, teachers and education practitioners could administer the IFT with items ordered in ascending item difficulties such that students could be placed along a scale of increasing person abilities. Depending on the purpose of the assessment, a cutoff score could also be flexibly determined for talent identification to suit specific educational settings and cultural contexts. Alternatively, targeting for particular regions of person abilities or talent potentials, selected item sets could also be used, as in the use of some forms of adaptive testing. © 2010 National Association for Gifted Children.

This study involved 27, 25, and 26 sixth grade students from one remote indigenous school in eastern Taiwan, one suburban indigenous school in northern Taiwan, and one urban Han Chinese school in northern Taiwan, respectively. Spatial ability assessments were carried out on the students to explore the spatial conceptualization abilities and the possible relationship between school children's spatial abilities and urban-rural, ethnic, and cultural diversities. The research tool utilized in this study was a scenario-based spatial ability assessment test, which had been carefully reviewed and pre-tested by experts. Test results revealed that: (1) Sixth grade students from the suburban and remote indigenous school shared no significant difference in their spatial abilities; (2) Sixth grade students from the urban Han Chinese school exhibited significantly better spatial performance than those from the suburban and remote indigenous schools. The spatial conceptualization performance for sixth grade elementary school students from urban, suburban and remote schools in Taiwan is different. © Authors.

Infants reach for endarkened objects at younger ages than for occluded objects, and infants’ looking patterns suggest that they expect occluded objects to reappear at younger ages than they reach for them. We reaffirm the latter finding in 5- to 6-month-olds and find similar responses to faded objects, but we fail to find that pattern in response to endarkened objects. This suggests that looking behavior and reaching behavior are both sensitive to method of disappearance, but with opposite effects. Current cognition-oriented (i.e. representation-oriented) explanations of looking behavior cannot easily accommodate these results; neither can perceptual-preference explanations, nor the traditional ecological reinterpretations of object permanence. A revised ecological hypothesis, invoking affordance learning, suggests how these differences could arise developmentally.	AE	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		5	5	1	NA	5	0	0	1

A total of 305 participants with and without ADHD were recruited. The  theta relative power of QEEG was analyzed using stepwise multiple regression, and  twelve scalp regions were compared between groups using independent t-tests.  Increased power was found at the T5 scalp region in the ADHD group and at the F4  region in the non-ADHD group. Decreased power was found at the F7 region in the ADHD  group and at the F3 region in the non-ADHD group. Six of the twelve brain locations  had significantly higher theta relative power in the ADHD group than in the non-ADHD  group. These brain mapping outcomes can be easily translated to neuropsychological  functions, such as attention, executive function, memory, spatial ability, and  language, to better understand or predict the potential behavior of ADHD patients.

Design: Two hundred (200) schoolchildren from Bangalore, India, after baseline assessment of cognitive functioning were randomly allocated to either a yoga or a physical-activity group. Cognitive functions (attention and concentration, visuo-spatial abilities, verbal ability, and abstract thinking) were assessed using an Indian adaptation of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at baseline, after 3 months of intervention, and later at a 3-month follow-up. Results: Of the 200 subjects, 193 were assessed at 3 months after the study, and then 180 were assessed at the 3-month follow-up. There were no significant differences in cognitive performance between the two study groups (yoga versus physical activity) at postintervention, after controlling for grade levels. Improvement in the mean scores of cognitive tests following intervention varied from 0.5 (Arithmetic) to 1.4 (Coding) for the yoga group and 0.7 (Arithmetic) to 1.6 (Vocabulary) in the physical-activity group. Conclusions: Yoga was as effective as physical activity in improving cognitive performance in 7-9 year old schoolchildren. Further studies are needed to examine the dose-response relationship between yoga and cognitive performance. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.)	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optm.2011.02.004	BACKGROUND: Vision affects daily activities, but of particular importance is the impact upon the learning process. Many studies have been conducted to establish the  relationship between vision problems and academic performance. The results are  varied, however, and suggest additional research is needed with particular care  given to study design. METHODS: This study included 1,103 year-2 school children  enrolled in 7 public schools in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia. There were an  equal proportion of males (50.6%) and females (49.4%). The testing battery was  designed to assess visual acuity, ocular muscle balance, visual analysis skills,  visual-spatial skills, and visual-motor integration skills. RESULTS: Children with  average and above-average achievement showed a different visual performance profile  from those children with low academic achievement. They had a statistically  significant better pass rate in physical aspects (visual acuity), physiological  aspects (ocular motor balance), and perceptual aspects (visual-motor  integration/visual-spatial and visual-analysis skills). CONCLUSION: Children with  low academic achievement are more likely to exhibit problems in visual acuity,  ocular motor balance, visual-motor integration and most all components of visual  analysis skills. This finding supports the concept that visual performance is key to  learning and therefore of chief concern as to school achievement.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		3	5	0	3	3	0	0	1

Arsenic in drinking water is associated with an increased risk of skin and internal cancers, peripheral vascular disease, ischemic heart disease, cerebral infarction, carotid atherosclerosis, electrocardiographic abnormalities (prolongation and increased dispersion of heart rate-corrected QT wave), microcirculation anomaly, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, posterior subcapsular opacity, pterygium, neurobehavioral (pattern memory and switching attention) disorders, peripheral neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, hepatitis and cirrhosis, kidney disease, and fungal infection of hands and feet in a dose-response relation. Genetic or acquired susceptibility play an important role in the arsenic-induced health hazards. Many molecular and genomic biomarkers have been developed to explore the gene-environment interactions in the pathogenesis of arsenic-induced health hazards. In the analysis of cancer mortality data of residents living in the Blackfoot disease-endemic area in southwestern Taiwan, the original standard of arsenic in drinking water (50 ppb) is associated with a substantial risk of cancer and is not sufficiently protective of public health. The findings have been used to set up the maximal contamination level of arsenic in drinking water (10 ppb), which was adopted by the World Health Organization, US Environmental Protection Agency, and many countries. A series of follow-up studies have been carried out to examine the health hazards of PCBs/PCDFs-contaminated rice-bran oil among the exposed victims and their off-springs with intrauterine exposure. The health hazards for the exposed victims included dermatological, ophthalmic, endocrine, immune, neurocognitive, hepatic, and reproductive diseases. Intrauterine exposure to rice-bran oil contaminated by PCBs/PCDFs was associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight, and neonatal and infant deaths. The offspring born to PCBs/PCDFs-exposed parents were affected with low body height and weight, low total lean mass and soft tissue mass, retarded mental and psychomotor development, delayed cognitive development, poor spatial ability, low IQ and behavior score, nail deformities, otitis media, poor dental development, and poor reproductive development. Follow-up studies have been carried out to assess the health hazards associated with the exposure to prolonged low-dose-rate gamma-irradiation from 60cobalt-contaminated buildings. The health effects included cytogenetic damages in peripheral lymphocytes, persistent depression in peripheral leukocytes and neutrophils and increase in eosinophils, altered distributions in lymphocyte subpopulations, lens opacities, delayed physical development in children, thyroid abnormalities, and increased risk of all leukemia except chronic lymphocytic leukemia in men and thyroid cancer in women. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, whether there is a relationship between spatial ability and mathematics achievement in deaf children and the mechanisms that underlie the relationship remain unknown. 256 deaf children in Grades 3 to 9 in two special education schools in China performed a series of cognitive and mathematical tests. After controlling for age and gender, we found that spatial ability, processing speed (both accuracy and reaction time), and intelligence were significantly related to mathematics achievement. Moreover, processing speed and intelligence were found to mediate the relationship between spatial ability and mathematics achievement in deaf children. The mediating effect of intelligence was significantly greater than the serial mediating effect of processing speed (accuracy) and then intelligence; both the mediating effect of processing speed (reaction time) and the mediating effect of intelligence were significantly greater than the serial mediating effect of processing speed (reaction time) and then intelligence. These findings suggest a process through which processing speed can decrease intelligence and identify the mediating effects of processing speed (both accuracy and reaction time) and intelligence in the relationship between spatial ability and mathematics achievement in deaf children. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Journal of neuroscience methods	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-0270(01)00475-7	Optical imaging over extended periods of time in non-human primates presents serious challenges because the dura mater must be removed to expose the cortical surface. We  present a novel nylon imaging chamber with a transparent artificial dura implant,  which allows repeated, long-term optical recordings from the cortex. The cylinder of  the chamber is inserted into a cranial trephination and held in place with a minimum  of screws and acrylic cement. A round patch of artificial dura with a perpendicular  wall protects the cortical surface and slows re-growth of dural tissue within the  chamber. A cap, manufactured from the same material as the cylinder, is screwed into  the chamber and seals it completely. Over a period of 1-4 months, the chamber  required a minimum of maintenance and stayed infection-free without local antibiotic  application. We repeatedly performed optical imaging in the same animal with the  advantages of shortened preparation time. To permit precise alignment and comparison  of maps obtained from different imaging sessions, we developed a program that  calculated a 2-dimensional spatial transformation between maps of different  magnifications, translations, and distortions. We suggest that these methods provide  a practical solution to long-term optical imaging in the anesthetized or alert  monkey. The exclusive use of non-metallic materials offers the benefit of a lighter  and more compact implant, and the possibility to perform MRI scans after chamber  implantation.

Method: Subjects from memory clinic of Huashan hospital including 130 of who met the operational criteria for Mayo Clinic defined aMCI by neuropsychological tests covering global cognitive function, executive function, memory function, language function and visual spatial skills. They underwent multidimensional assessment and a neuropsychological battery at baseline and at follow-up, after about 2 years. Diagnosis for dementia was based on National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke; Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. Results: Forty-four cases of 130 (33.8%) elder people with aMCI converted to probable AD with 17 aMCI-s and 27 aMCI-m subjects within an average 23.8(6.8) months. There was significant difference between the reversion rate of aMCI-s and aMCI-m (26.2% vs 42.9%, χ 2=3.957, P=0.047). Moreover, as the disease progressing, the two groups declined similarly in memory and executive function while in the aMCI-s group, the function of spatial structure relatively reserved in aMCI-s but function of language and attention diminished faster, and in the aMCI-m group, the ability of spatial structure declined even more significantly. Conclusion: The aMCI-m is more likely to progress to AD than aMCI-s and it's necessary to divide aMCI into aMCI-s and aMCI-m to help determine prognosis.

Few studies involved  the psychocognitive assessment in such a drug-treatable epileptic syndrome  especially in the newly diagnosed and medications-naive group.

METHOD: Forty-one outpatients with newly diagnosed BECTs who visited the  Clinic during the periods from October 2012 to May 2014 before the medications  against epilepsy and 41 healthy controls recruited from regular school in Beijing  during the period from July 2013 to March 2014, who matched in age and gender  underwent battery testing by computerized cognitive testing in epilepsy (CCTE). The  BECTs group included 41 children, 20 boys and 21 girls, mean age (8.2 ± 1.7) years,  the age of onset of epilepsy 4.5-11.5 years (the age of onset <8 years in 25 cases,  ≥ 8 years in 16 cases). The cognitive characteristics and associated factors were  analyzed. The primary data including correct answer numbers and reaction times were  analyzed by independent sample t-test between the two groups of children with BECTs  and healthy controls based on SPSS 18.0 statistical software. RESULT: Raw data of 9  tasks' scores collected from BECTs and healthy control children were continuous  variables in accordance with normal distribution. BECTs children performed  significantly worse than controls in choice reaction time ((618+158) vs. (524+254)  ms), three-dimensional mental rotation (11 ± 10 vs. 18 ± 12) and visual tracing (10  ± 6 vs.15 ± 6), t=2.01, 3.03 and 3.47, P<0.05, <0.01 and <0.001, respectively.While  other 6 tasks showed no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05 for  all comparisons). BECTs boys performed significantly worse than girls on simple  substraction tasks compared with standard nine score ((4.7 ± 1.5) vs. (5.6 ± 1.2),  t=-2.24, P<0.05). Other 8 tasks showed no significant difference between boys and  girls (P>0.05 for all comparisons). Other 9 tasks showed no significant differences  between the two groups of BECTs children whose age of onset was before 8 years and  those who started seizure ≥ 8 years (P all >0.05). The standard nine scores of  simple substraction from the three BECTs groups of dominance sides of spikes and  waves during NREM showed significant difference (P<0.05). BECTs children with  bilateral discharges performed significantly worse than the other two groups  dominantly right or left discharges (4.7 ± 1.2 vs. 6.0 ± 1.2 vs. 4.9 ± 1.4, P all  <0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups with right and  left side dominance discharges (P>0.05). Other 8 tasks showed no significant  differences among the three groups (P>0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION:  Although EEG discharges index below 50% during NREM period, while newly diagnosed  BECTs children before treatment with medications against epilepsy performed poorer  on tasks of choice reaction time, three-dimensional mental rotation, and visual  tracing. The two factors of male and bilateral discharges during NREM period  correlate with dysfunction of simple subtraction, the mechanism needs further study  and the cognitive function of epilepsy children should be evaluated and followed up,  in order to provide psychologic baseline data for persistent cognitive disturbance.

Biomed. Opt. Imaging Proc. SPIE	https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2081470	Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major cause of brain injury in preterm neonates. Quantitative measurement of ventricular dilation or shrinkage is important for monitoring patients and in evaluation of treatment options. 3D ultrasound (US) has been used to monitor the ventricle volume as a biomarker for ventricular dilation. However, volumetric quantification does not provide information as to where dilation occurs. The location where dilation occurs may be related to specific neurological problems later in life. For example, posterior horn enlargement, with thinning of the corpus callosum and parietal white matter fibres, could be linked to poor visuo-spatial abilities seen in hydrocephalic children. In this work, we report on the development and application of a method used to analyze local surface change of the ventricles of preterm neonates with IVH from 3D US images. The technique is evaluated using manual segmentations from 3D US images acquired in two imaging sessions. The surfaces from baseline and follow-up were registered and then matched on a point-by-point basis. The distance between each pair of corresponding points served as an estimate of local surface change of the brain ventricle at each vertex. The measurements of local surface change were then superimposed on the ventricle surface to produce the 3D local surface change map that provide information on the spatio-temporal dilation pattern of brain ventricles following IVH. This tool can be used to monitor responses to different treatment options, and may provide important information for elucidating the deficiencies a patient will have later in life. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

We therefore evaluated cognitive functions related to and unrelated to the functionality of the frontal lobe in childhood absence epilepsy patients and control subjects. Thirty-seven childhood absence epilepsy patients and 37 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects were recruited and assessed using a computerized neuropsychological test battery. Childhood absence epilepsy patients, especially a drug-naïve subgroup, showed cognitive deficits in reasoning, visual attention, and executive function, which are typical cognitive functions of the frontal lobe. In contrast, treated childhood absence epilepsy patients only exhibited cognitive deficits in visual attention. There were no significant between-group differences for other cognitive tests. Our findings suggest that frontal lobe-related cognitive deficits represent the characteristic neuropsychological profile associated with childhood absence epilepsy. © SAGE Publications.

Frontiers in psychiatry	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2017.00166	Neuropsychological studies indicate that new-onset childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is associated with deficits in attention and executive functioning. However, the  contribution of these deficits to impaired academic performance remains unclear. We  aimed to examine whether attention and executive functioning deficits account for  the academic difficulties prevalent in patients with new-onset CAE. We analyzed  cognitive performance in several domains, including language, mathematics,  psychomotor speed, spatial ability, memory, general intelligence, attention, and  executive functioning, in 35 children with new-onset CAE and 33 control  participants. Patients with new-onset CAE exhibited deficits in mathematics, general  intelligence, attention, and executive functioning. Furthermore, attention deficits,  as measured by a visual tracing task, accounted for impaired arithmetic performance  in the new-onset CAE group. Therefore, attention deficits, rather than impaired  general intelligence or executive functioning, may be responsible for arithmetic  performance deficits in patients with new-onset CAE.

Pediatric neurology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2016.12.005	BACKGROUND: Childhood absence epilepsy and benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes are the most common forms of benign epilepsy syndromes.  Although cognitive dysfunctions occur in children with both childhood absence  epilepsy and benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, the similarity  between their patterns of underlying cognitive impairments is not well understood.  To describe these patterns, we examined multiple cognitive functions in children  with childhood absence epilepsy and benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal  spikes. METHODS: In this study, 43 children with childhood absence epilepsy, 47  children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and 64 control  subjects were recruited; all received a standardized assessment (i.e., computerized  test battery) assessing processing speed, spatial skills, calculation, language  ability, intelligence, visual attention, and executive function. Groups were  compared in these cognitive domains. Simple regression analysis was used to analyze  the effects of epilepsy-related clinical variables on cognitive test scores.  RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, children with childhood absence epilepsy  and benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes showed cognitive deficits  in intelligence and executive function, but performed normally in language  processing. Impairment in visual attention was specific to patients with childhood  absence epilepsy, whereas impaired spatial ability was specific to the children with  benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. Simple regression analysis  showed syndrome-related clinical variables did not affect cognitive functions.  CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of both common and distinctive cognitive  features underlying the relative cognitive difficulties in children with childhood  absence epilepsy and benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. Our data  suggest that clinicians should pay particular attention to the specific cognitive  deficits in children with childhood absence epilepsy and benign childhood epilepsy  with centrotemporal spikes, to allow for more discriminative and potentially more  effective interventions.

BMC neurology	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-020-01807-z	BACKGROUND: Interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) have been proven to impair cognitive function. However, it is not clear whether IEDs disrupt academic  performance in children with idiopathic epilepsy, and the contribution of cognitive  function deficits to impaired academic performance has not been clarified. This  study aimed to examine the cognitive deficits and academic impairment in childhood  idiopathic epilepsy with IEDs. METHODS: Ninety-seven childhood idiopathic epilepsy  with IEDs, 77 childhood idiopathic epilepsy without IEDs, and 71 healthy controls  completed a series of cognitive tests. We analyzed the cognitive performance in  several domains including language, mathematics, psychomotor speed, spatial ability,  memory, general intelligence, attention and executive functioning. Analysis of  variance was conducted to compare the performance on all tests between the three  groups. RESULTS: Childhood idiopathic epilepsy with IEDs exhibited not only general  cognitive deficits in processing speed, spatial ability, and attention, but also  arithmetic impairment. Furthermore, general cognitive deficits could account for the  impaired arithmetic performance in childhood idiopathic epilepsy with IEDs.  CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that IEDs in children with idiopathic epilepsy  affected both cognitive function and academic performance, and that the cognitive  deficits may be responsible for arithmetic performance impairment.

Children were pretested on a range of number and math skills. Then one group received a single session of mental rotation training using an object completion task that had previously improved spatial ability in children this age (Ehrlich, Levine, & Goldin-Meadow, 2006). The remaining children completed crossword puzzles instead. Children's posttest scores revealed that those in the spatial training group improved significantly on calculation problems. In contrast, children in the control group did not improve on any math tasks. Further analyses revealed that the spatial training group's improvement was largely due to better performance on missing term problems (e.g., 4 + ____ = 11). © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Methods: The sample consisted of 254 healthy Spanish-speakers, ages 19-60 years, recruited from the U.S.-Mexico border regions of Arizona (n = 102) and California (n = 152). Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery assessing multiple domains (verbal fluency, speed of information processing, attention/working memory, executive function, learning and memory, visual-spatial skills and fine motor skills). Fluency in both Spanish and English was assessed with performance-based measures. Other culturally-relevant data on educational, social, and language background were obtained via self-report. Demographic influences on test performances were modeled using fractional polynomial equations that allow consideration of linear and non-linear effects. Results: There were no significant demographic differences between participants tested in Arizona and California. Age and gender were similar across education ranges. Two thirds of the sample were Spanish dominant and the remainder were considered bilingual. Individual articles in this Special Issue detail the generation of demographically adjusted T-scores for the various tests in the battery as well as an exploration of bilingualism effects. Discussion: Norms developed through the NP-NUMBRS project stand to improve the diagnostic accuracy of neuropsychological assessment in Spanish-speaking young-to-middle-aged adults living in the U.S.-Mexico border region. Application of the present norms to other groups should be done with caution. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Responses from 60 boys and 60 girls about their favorite toys, television shows, computer games, and outdoor activities were compared across leisure categories. The results showed that gender was a significant factor. Overall, boys spent more time in these leisure activities than girls did. They spent the most time engaged in sports, watching television, and playing computer games, whereas girls spent the most time watching television. Results from a gender index for all activities indicated that boys' leisure preferences became slightly more masculine with age. For girls, preferences for television shows became more feminine with age, but preferences for toys, computer games, and sports became less feminine. These self-chosen preferences may provide differential opportunities for the development of visual-spatial skills, achievement, initiative, self-regulation, and social skills. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

Sixty-one US undergraduates from the Midwest completed 4 h of either massed or distributed practice. While computer game practice improved mental rotation scores in general, women's gains were significantly greater than men's, and the most significant gains were accomplished when practice was massed. High mathematical ability, gender, and type of practice significantly predicted improvement scores. The findings suggest that even very minimal computer game practice may improve performance on mental rotation tasks.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.2466/23.25.PMS.119c12z0	Recent studies suggest that even short-term video game training may transfer to other cognitive tasks. With the popularity of the Nintendo Wii with women, more of  them might be exposed to the games that will increase their mental rotation skills.  Because performance on mental rotation tests (MRT) has been linked to math  performance in women, and thus may ultimately contribute to the under representation  of women in STEM fields, it is important to continue to explore ways to decrease or  eliminate the robust sex difference in mental rotation. The present study of 30 men  and 30 women provides additional evidence that women may benefit from short-term (1  hour) training on either a Nintendo Wii™ or GameCube console to increase their  mental rotation skills. One hour of video game training not only increased women's  MRT scores to a level similar to men's scores, but also produced greater average  improvement for women, even when controlling for experiential factors such as  spatial and masculine childhood activities that could contribute to the sex  difference in spatial ability.

The present study examined the effects of a prior exposure to a mental rotation task, i.e., adapted Cube Comparison test, and to three-dimensional objects, i.e., Legos™, on the performance on the Mental Rotation Test. 113 men and women were randomly divided into three conditions: control, exposure, or detailed instructions. On average, men outperformed women. Further analyses showed that sex differences were significant in the control condition but not in the other two, suggesting that a cuing effect may explain some of the robust sex differences in visuospatial tasks.

The Journal of urology	https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ju.0000091640.59812.83	PURPOSE: Men with prostate specific antigen (PSA) only relapse of prostate cancer after primary therapy are generally fully functional and asymptomatic with a life  expectancy of up to 10 or more years. These patients are often treated with androgen  suppression. We evaluate the effects of androgen suppression on cognitive function.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hormone naïve patients without evidence of metastases with an  increasing PSA were treated with intermittent androgen suppression consisting of 9  months of leuprolide and flutamide followed by an off treatment period determined by  the increase in PSA. Cognitive function tests were administered at baseline, after 9  months of androgen suppression and after 3 months off treatment. Cognitive tests  measured spatial abilities, spatial memory, verbal fluency, verbal memory and  selective attention. A total of 19 patients 52 to 76 years old completed the  intermittent androgen suppression study along with 15 healthy community dwelling  control participants. RESULTS: Combined androgen blockade reduced PSA and  testosterone in all patients compared to baseline. Patients did not significantly  change on measures of verbal and spatial memory, executive functions or language.  Patients declined on a measure of spatial rotation and improved on a measure of  verbal memory during treatment which continued during the off treatment period.  CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, these findings demonstrate that 9 months of  combined androgen blockade resulted in a beneficial effect on verbal memory but  adversely affected a measure of spatial ability. Intermittent androgen suppression  for a period of 9 months in otherwise healthy men with prostate cancer may have  beneficial and adverse effects on cognition that are selective.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a common treatment option. This study examined mood and cognitive changes in otherwise healthy men with prostate cancer prior to, during and after ADT. Experimental design: Twenty hormone naïve, eugonadal prostate cancer patients without evidence of metastases and with a rising PSA were treated with intermittent ADT consisting of 9 months of complete androgen blockade (CAB) achieved with combined leuprolide and flutamide followed by an 'off treatment' period. Cognitive function tests and mood measures were administered at baseline, after 3 and 9 months of ADT and after 3 months of no treatment. Twenty healthy control patients without prostate cancer range matched for age and education were tested at the same time intervals. Results: ADT patients evidenced a significant decline in spatial reasoning, spatial abilities and working memory during treatment compared with baseline. No changes were noted for measures of verbal or spatial memory, selective attention or language. Significant changes in self-rated mood such as increased depression, tension, anxiety, fatigue and irritability were evident during treatment compared with baseline for ADT patients. No significant changes in either cognitive tests or mood measures were noted for the healthy control group. Conclusions: These findings, suggest that 9 months of combined androgen blockade may result in some adverse changes in cognition and mood. However, many but not all of these changes can return to baseline after cessation of ADT. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	3	3	0	0	1

BMC cancer	https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-10-1	BACKGROUND: A common treatment option for men with prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, men undergoing ADT may experience physical side  effects, changes in quality of life and sometimes psychiatric and cognitive side  effects. METHODS: In this study, hormone naïve patients without evidence of  metastases with a rising PSA were treated with nine months of ADT. Functional  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain during three visuospatial tasks was  performed at baseline prior to treatment and after nine months of ADT in five  subjects. Seven healthy control patients, underwent neuroimaging at the same time  intervals. RESULTS: ADT patients showed reduced, task-related BOLD-fMRI activation  during treatment that was not observed in control subjects. Reduction in activation  in right parietal-occipital regions from baseline was observed during recall of the  spatial location of objects and mental rotation. CONCLUSIONS: Findings, while  preliminary, suggest that ADT reduces task-related neural activation in brain  regions that are involved in mental rotation and accurate recall of spatial  information.

A developmental perspective was used to assess the process by which spatial skills are acquired.    Twenty seven children were included, divided into brain-damaged, premature, and normal groups. These groups were matched on the following variables: age, sex, social class, and verbal IQ. The children ranged in age from 6 to 11.    Two tasks were employed. One was similar to the Piagetian three-mountain task, where children were asked to match the position of their toy animal with that of the experimenter. Color cues were used on some of the trials and were absent on others. Additionally, the experimenter's board was reversed on half of the trials, requiring the child to figure out the correct placement without being able to perceptually match the stimulus figures with his. The second task, a visualization task, tested the child's ability to mentally rotate figures in space. Two types of figures were used: two-dimensional and three-dimensional. These stimuli were arranged in order of increasing difficulty so it was possible to determine at what point the children began to experience difficulty.    The results indicated that brain-damaged, but not premature and normal controls, had significant delay in the acquisition of the ability to reverse one dimension in space. They were unable to perceptually match their animal with the experimenter's but could use color cues to solve the problem. They could not perform as well as the two control groups when correct placement required reversal of a spatial dimension. Some difficulty also was found in perceptually matching spatial orientation. It was not possible to determine if these delays would at some point be resolved or if permanent impairment would result. On the mental rotations task, brain damaged children were found to have difficulty rotating two-dimensional items, particularly when mirror images were present. Normal and premature subjects made significantly fewer errors on two-dimensional rotation.    It was concluded that parietal lobe surgery, performed in infancy, could impair spatial processing. Further research is needed to determine if the impairment found here persists or if it is alleviated with increasing age.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Assessment of an at-home visuospatial intervention.	Psychological research	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-019-01202-5	The current study examined whether the effect of spatial training transfers to the math domain. Sixty-two 6- and 7-year-olds completed an at-home 1-week online  training intervention. The spatial-training group received mental rotation training,  whereas the active control group received literacy training in a format that matched  the spatial training. Results revealed near transfer of mental rotation ability in  the spatial-training group. More importantly, there was also far transfer to  canonical arithmetic problems, such that children in the spatial-training group  performed better on these math problems than children in the control group. Such far  transfer could not be attributed to general cognitive improvement, since no  improvement was observed for non-symbolic quantity processing, verbal working memory  (WM), or language ability following spatial training. Spatial training may have  benefitted symbolic arithmetic performance by improving visualization ability,  access to the mental number line, and/or increasing the capacity of visuospatial WM.

Brain injury	https://doi.org/10.3109/02699052.2012.666366	BACKGROUND: Childhood acquired brain injury (ABI) often leads to impairment in cognitive functioning, resulting in disabilities in both the home and school  environment. Assessing the impact of these cognitive deficits in everyday life using  traditional neuropsychological tests has been challenging. This study systematically  reviewed ecological measures of cognitive abilities available for children with ABI.  METHOD: Eight databases were searched (until October 2011) for scales: (1) focused  on ecological assessment of cognitive functioning; (2) with published data in an ABI  population; (3) applicable to children up to 17;11 years of age; and (4) in English.  The title and abstract of all papers were reviewed independently by two reviewers.  RESULTS: Database searches yielded a total of 12 504 references, of which 17 scales  met the inclusion criteria for the review, focusing on executive functions (n = 9),  memory (n = 3), general cognitive abilities (n = 2), visuo-spatial skills (n = 2)  and attention (n = 1). Four tasks used observation of actual performance in a  natural environment, five were proxy-reports and six were functional paper and  pencil type tasks, performed in an office. CONCLUSION: Overall, few measures were  found; eight were still experimental tasks which did not provide norms. Executive  functions were better represented in ecological assessment, with relatively more  standardized scales available.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Neuropsycholinguistic tests were administered longitudinally at times separated by an interval of one year between the age of six and 16 years. Scores showed significant discrepancies in her neuropsychological development with an extreme scatter of strengths and deficiencies. The most significant functional deficiencies were language acquisition at the expressive level and visual-spatial skills; in contrast, academic achievement was good (logical reasoning superior according to Piagetian tasks). Clinical, educational and neuropsychological research implications of the longitudinal pattern are discussed for further studies. © 1987, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

database	CHIEN, SHU-CHEN	1986	thesis	THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANIMATED AND INTERACTIVE MICROCOMPUTER GRAPHICS ON CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT OF SPATIAL VISUALIZATION ABILITY/MENTAL ROTATION SKILLS (EDUCATIONAL INSTRUCTION, TECHNOLOGY)		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effectiveness-animated-interactive-microcomputer/docview/303485356/se-2?accountid=11531	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of dynamic and interactive microcomputer graphics on children's acquisition of spatial visualization ability, and, in particular, on mental rotation in two dimensions. Age and sex related differences were also investigated. A series of animated and interactive microcomputer spatial tasks were applied as experimental group treatment, while a series of hands-on activities which simulated the computer program were conducted as control group treatment for comparison. A group test, the Spatial Visualization Ability Test/Mental Rotation (SVAT/MR), which consisted of 20 spatial mental rotation tasks, served as the instrument of evaluation.    This study consisted of a pre-test followed by experimental treatments and concluded by the same test at the completion of the experiment. Treatment (computer spatial tasks; hands-on tasks), grade (1, 3 and 5), and sex (male and female) were employed as independent variables. The post-test score was the dependent variable.    Seventy two public elementary school children were randomly selected and assigned to each treatment group. Subjects were classified according to grade level and sex with each treatment group.    The results of the analysis of covariance revealed that the interaction among treatment, grade and sex, and the interactions between treatment and grade, grade and sex, treatment and sex did not yield significant (p < .05) results. The treatment main effect demonstrated a marginally significant (p < .085) result and the sex main effect demonstrated a marginally significant (p < .071) result.    It was concluded that microcomputer graphic spatial programs were slightly more effective than hands-on manipulative tasks in children's acquisition of spatial mental rotation skills. In addition, male subjects showed marginally better performance than female subjects on the SVAT/MR after the treatment.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.583968	Previous studies with adult human participants revealed mixed effects regarding the relation between spatial ability and visual instructions. In this study, we  investigated this question in primary young children, and particularly we explored  how young children with varying levels of spatial abilities integrate information  from both static and dynamic visualizations. Children (M = 6.5 years) were  instructed to rate their invested mental effort and reproduce the motor actions  presented from static and dynamic 3D visualizations. The results indicated an  interaction of spatial ability and type of visualization: high spatial ability  children benefited particularly from the animation, while low spatial ability  learners did not, confirming therefore the ability-as-enhancer hypothesis. The study  suggests that an understanding of children spatial ability is essential to enhance  learning from external visualizations.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Third grade, fifth grade, and college students (ages 9, 11, and 20 years, respectively) were required to determine whether a letter of the alphabet was presented in its backward or normal position. Letters were presented at 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, or 300° orientations from upright. Subjects were given no advance information about a test letter, or they were given identity and orientation information. In the no information condition, reaction time increased for all age groups as a function of the departure in orientation of the test letter from an upright position. In the advance information condition, reaction time remained uniform across orientation for only the college subjects. The developmental implications of these findings are discussed. © 1979.

American journal of medical genetics	https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.1230	Over recent years interest in the study of behavior phenotypes has gained increasing momentum. We present three white female patients, age respectively 9 years 9 months,  14 years 6 months and 18 years at the time of the last observation, seen because of  developmental delay/mental retardation, seizures and learning disabilities.  Cytogenetic analysis showed a de novo deletion of the short arm of chromosome 9 in  all three, with the breakpoint being located at band 9p22. Although several studies  have described the somatic phenotype, analytical evaluation of verbal and non-verbal  cognitive functions are lacking. Our patients received a detailed neuropsychological  and linguistic evaluation that showed a particular behavior profile, in the context  of mental retardation of variable degree. On selective tests there was a marked  deficit in visuo-praxic and visuo-spatial skills associated with memory disturbance.  Visuo-motor integration abilities [VMI; Beery, 1997] and visuo-perceptual and  visuo-spatial abilities [Benton line orientation test, 1992] seemed particularly  impaired, both in relation to verbal mental age (vocabulary and grammatical  production/comprehension) and to some non-verbal competencies [Benton face  recognition test, 1992]. The profile shows advanced performances in face  recognition. In addition, there is also a dissociation between verbal and  visuo-spatial short term memory. This behavior phenotype is similar to that of  Williams syndrome (WS) individuals. Our patients also showed some unusual  within-domain dissociations regarding linguistic abilities. To better demonstrate  similarities and differences between the behavior phenotypes of the del (9p22)  syndrome and WS, we studied three IQ-gender-matched WS subjects. The comparison  between the cognitive phenotypes of the two syndromes shows similarities in  neuropsychological pattern. We hypothesize that there is a gene within the 9p22  region responsible for the neuropsychological profile described here.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	2	2	0	0	1

Neurophysiological measures indicate that such functional segregation is present early on in infancy, and that the two streams follow independent maturational trajectories during childhood. Here we collected, in a large sample of young children and adults, behavioural measures on an extensive set of functions typically associated with either the dorsal or the ventral stream. We then used a correlational approach to investigate the presence of inter-individual variability resulting in clustering of functions. Results show that dorsal- and ventral-related functions follow two uncorrelated developmental trajectories. Moreover, within each stream, some functions show age-independent correlations: finger gnosis, non-symbolic numerical abilities and spatial abilities within the dorsal stream, and object and face recognition abilities within the ventral stream. This pattern of clear within-stream cross-task correlation seems to be lost in adults, with two notable exceptions: performance in face and object recognition on one side, and in symbolic and non-symbolic comparison on the other, remain correlated, pointing to distinct shape recognition and quantity comparison systems. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

The connection between the digital and physical worlds provided by embodied interaction has been shown to enhance performance and engagement in educational contexts. Spatial reasoning is a domain that lends itself naturally to embodied, physical interaction; however, there is little understanding of how embodied interaction could be incorporated into educational technology designed to train spatial reasoning skills. We propose several guidelines for gestural interaction design in spatial reasoning education games based on an empirical study with students at a local afterschool program using a custom-built computer game for training spatial skills. We present a series of gesture sets derived from an iterative design approach that are easy for children to acquire, show sufficient congruency to specific spatial operations, and enable robust recognition from the system. We also compared children's behaviors when playing the game with our gestural interface and a traditional mouse-based interface and found that children take more time but fewer steps to complete game levels when using gestures. © 2018 ACM.

Sex differences in object memory and spatial perception tasks were found in children as young as 9 years of age although differences in route-learning strategies did not emerge until 12 years of age. This was followed by sex-specific patterns of cognitive processes underlying route-learning strategies in adolescents, suggesting that route-learning strategies emanate from different spatial processes. Results are consistent with the notion of specialized spatial processes in males and females, presumed to be the products of differential evolutionary pressures related to the division of labour. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Similarly, spatial research based on pencil-and-paper psychometric tasks has revealed reliable gender differences in performance levels. Although initial studies (Choi & Silverman, 1996; Dabbs et al., 1998) suggest that qualitative route-learning differences are associated with quantitative spatial performance levels in adults, developmental research has been neglected. The present studies addressed this void, investigating the emergence of gender differences on psychometric spatial tasks and route-learning strategies using a direction-giving paradigm. Children and adolescents, aged 8 to 17 years, provided directions from points of origin to destination points using a novel map. Route-learning strategies were coded for landmark, distance, relative and cardinal direction frequencies. All participants also completed a spatial battery comprising of Spatial Relations, a water level task and Silverman and Eals' (1992) object and location memory task. An additional spatial task, Flags, was added to the battery completed by the older sample. Each measure in the battery represented one of three spatial subcomponents: mental rotation, spatial perception and location memory. Three main findings emerged: (1) gender differences in mental rotation, spatial perception, and object location tasks existed to various degrees before puberty, which were also found in adolescents; (2) girls demonstrated a preference for landmarks, which emerged during puberty and persisted thereafter; and (3) landmark preferences were negatively associated with spatial perception in boys but positively associated with location memory in girls. These patterns are consistent with the evolutionary perspective of specialized spatial capacities and suggest that integration of qualitative spatial data may provide additional insight into spatial gender differences.

Maps are an important tool for both navigating through and learning about the environment. Better understanding of how maps influence our spatial thought will help us to develop more complete theories of spatial development and provide better spatial education. The present study investigated the following aspects of children’s map-use: (a) whether or not two different mapping tasks elicit similar performance and strategies from children, (b) if using a map results in better survey knowledge compared to not using a map, and (c) how individual differences in spatial ability relate to map-use performance.    To address these issues, 9- to 10-year-old children (N = 58) were tested in one of three conditions: comprehension, production, or no-map. In the comprehension condition, children used a map marked with target locations and tried to place flags in the environment precisely at those target locations. In the production condition, children searched for flags in the environment and then placed stickers on a map to indicate the flags' locations. In the no-map condition, children searched for flags without a map in order to solve a riddle. After completing the search task in one of these three conditions, children completed measures of environmental survey knowledge and of spatial skills.    Comprehension and production tasks were hypothesized to be conducive to different levels of strategy use during the task. Performance was expected to be affected by these different strategies. Specifically, it was predicted that the comprehension task would elicit greater map use (looking at, aligning, and touching the map), which would, in turn, lead to better performance. It was also predicted that children in either map condition (comprehension or production) would do better on measures of survey knowledge in comparison to children in the no-map condition. Spatial skills as measured by paper-and-pencil tests were hypothesized to be positively related to performance on the mapping task.    As hypothesized, results showed that accuracy in placing the flags or stickers differed between children in the comprehension and production groups. This effect was mediated by strategy use such that those in the comprehension condition spent a greater proportion of time aligning, looking at, and touching the map and this greater use of strategies was associated with better performance on placing the flags. The hypothesis that map use would lead to better survey knowledge was not supported by the data and potential reasons for this finding are discussed. Results provided support for the hypothesis that performance on laboratory paper-and-pencil spatial tasks would predict performance on the mapping tasks.    This study shows that comprehension and production mapping tasks do not elicit equivalent strategies or performance, and thus implies that caution is needed when selecting methods for mapping research. The finding that performing a search task in an environment with a map does not necessarily lead to better survey knowledge than exploring it without a map raises several questions about how map use might be related to the acquisition of survey knowledge more generally. More broadly, this study has implications for the design of mobile mapping devices and the education of map skills.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Infant behavior & development	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2016.09.005	Mental rotation (MR) involves the ability to predict how an object will look once it has been rotated into a new orientation in space. To date, studies of MR in infants  have tested this ability using abstract stimuli presented using a single display.  Evidence from existing studies suggests that using multiple displays may affect an  infant's performance in some kinds of MR tasks. This study used Moore & Johnson's  (2008) simplified Shepard-Metzler objects in a dual-monitor MR task presented to  five-month-old infants. Evidence for MR in infancy was found. These findings have  implications for MR testing in infancy and the influence of display properties on  infant MR performance.

Recent research has shown that our knowledge is shaped by the interaction between our body and the environment. In this article, we review and discuss evidence on: 1) how spontaneous gesture can reveal the development of problem solving strategies when people solve spatial problems; 2) whether producing gestures can enhance spatial problem solving performance. We argue that when solving novel spatial problems, adults go through deagentivization and internalization processes, which are analogous to young children's cognitive development processes. Furthermore, gesture enhances spatial problem solving performance. The beneficial effect of gesturing can be extended to non-gesturing trials and can be generalized to a different spatial task that shares similar spatial transformation processes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Hand-object interaction gestures were produced earlier than object-movement gestures, the rate of both types of gestures decreased, and gestures became more distant from the stimulus object over trials (Experiments 1 and 3). Furthermore, in the first few trials, object-movement gestures increased, whereas hand-object interaction gestures decreased, and this change of motor strategies was also reflected in the type of verbal description of rotation in the concurrent speech (Experiment 2). This change of motor strategies was hampered when gestures were prohibited (Experiment 4). The authors concluded that the motor strategy becomes less dependent on agentive action on the object, and also becomes internalized over the course of the experiment, and that gesture facilitates the former process. When solving a problem regarding the physical world, adults go through developmental processes similar to internalization and symbolic distancing in young children, albeit within a much shorter time span.

This phenomenon had been exploited to reveal a great deal about the minds of preverbal infants. Many prominent studies of the neural bases of adult cognition over the past decade have relied on the fact that brain regions habituate to repeated stimuli – i.e. that the hemodynamic responses observed in fMRI tend to decline upon repeated stimulus presentations. This phenomenon has been exploited to reveal a great deal about the neural mechanisms of perception and cognition. Similarities in the mechanics of these two forms of habituation suggest that it may be useful to relate them to each other.

Objective We apply temporally informative tooth-matrix biomarkers to uncover windows of susceptibility in early life when Mn is associated with visual motor ability in childhood. We also explore effect modification by lead (Pb) and child sex. Methods Participants were drawn from the ELEMENT (Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology) longitudinal birth cohort studies. We reconstructed dose and timing of prenatal and early postnatal Mn and Pb exposures for 138 children by analyzing deciduous teeth using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Neurodevelopment was assessed between 6 and 16 years of age using the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA). Mn associations with total WRAVMA scores and subscales were estimated with multivariable generalized additive mixed models. We examined Mn interactions with Pb and child sex in stratified models. Results Levels of dentine Mn were highest in the second trimester and declined steeply over the prenatal period, with a slower rate of decline after birth. Mn was positively associated with visual spatial and total WRAVMA scores in the second trimester, among children with lower (< median) tooth Pb levels: one standard deviation (SD) increase in ln-transformed dentine Mn at 150 days before birth was associated with a 0.15 [95% CI: 0.04, 0.26] SD increase in total score. This positive association was not observed at high Pb levels. In contrast to the prenatal period, significant negative associations were found in the postnatal period from ~ 6 to 12 months of age, among boys only: one SD increase in ln-transformed dentine Mn was associated with a 0.11 [95% CI: − 0.001, − 0.22] to 0.16 [95% CI: − 0.04, − 0.28] SD decrease in visual spatial score. Conclusions Using tooth-matrix biomarkers with fine scale temporal profiles of exposure, we found discrete developmental windows in which Mn was associated with visual-spatial abilities. Our results suggest that Mn associations are driven in large part by exposure timing, with beneficial effects found for prenatal levels and toxic effects found for postnatal levels. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Neuroscience letters	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2008.10.094	Functional neuroimaging studies investigating sex differences in visuospatial processing traditionally focus on mental rotation tasks in adults, as it is a  consistently robust finding, with a limited number of studies examining tasks  tapping visuospatial skills at a more basic level. Furthermore, fewer studies have  examined this issue in conjunction with investigating whether differences exist in  younger populations. Therefore, functional neuroimaging was used to examine whether  sex-based differences exist and/or develop during childhood. Thirty-two  participants, matched on performance, participated in this study. Overall, both  groups showed overlapping activation in bilateral superior parietal lobe,  extrastriate cortex, and cerebellum; differences between the sexes showed that males  had significantly greater activation in right lingual gyrus and cerebellum. Formal  comparisons between age groups revealed that older males show engagement of left  hemisphere regions, while females show greater bilateral (R>L) engagement of regions  traditionally associated with visuospatial processing. Together, these results  suggest that older males, as compared to younger males, may engage regions that are  associated with a visuomotor network, whereas females utilize areas indicated in  spatial attention and working memory. Furthermore, these results could also suggest  that there may be differences in strategy use that are evident early on and may  continue to develop over time evident by differential engagement of networks  associated with visuospatial processing. Our data provide evidence for sex-based  differences in the neural basis of visuospatial processing.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.651678	Spatial skills predict important life outcomes, such as mathematical achievement or entrance into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  Children significantly vary in their spatial performance even before they enter  formal schooling. One correlate of children's spatial performance is the spatial  language they produce and hear from others, such as their parents. Because the  emphasis has been on spatial language, less is known about the role of hand gestures  in children's spatial development. Some children are more likely to fall behind in  their spatial skills than others. Children born premature (gestational age <37  weeks) constitute such a risk group. Here, we compared performance of term and  preterm-born children on two non-verbal spatial tasks-mental transformation and  block design. We also examined relations of children's performance on these tasks to  parental spatial language and gesture input and their own production of spatial  language and gesture during an independent puzzle play interaction. We found that  while term and preterm-born children (n = 40) as a group did not differ in the  mental transformation or block design performance, children varied widely in their  performance within each group. The variability in mental transformation scores was  predicted by both a subset of spatial words (what aspects of spatial information)  and all spatial gestures children produced. Children's spatial language and gesture  were in turn related to their parents' spatial language and gesture. Parental  spatial language and gesture had an indirect relation on children's mental  transformation, but not block design, scores via children's spatial language, and  gesture use. Overall, results highlight the unique contributions of speech and  gesture in communicating spatial information and predicting children's spatial  performance.

Two studies were conducted. In Study 1, two groups of nonconservers, one who demonstrated the ability to establish one-to-one correspondences to determine numerical equivalence and one who did not, were presented with one of two sets of four trials, one that consisted of a small and the other a larger set size. In Study 2, two groups of conservers, one who provided more mature explanations for conservation judgments and one who provided less mature explanations, were presented with one of two sets of six number conservation trials, one that consisted of a small and the other a larger set size. In both studies, following standard conservation assessment trials, children were asked to count the sets and then make another conservation judgment. For nonconservers, counting produced evidence of conservation. For conservers, counting produced evidence of apparent nonconservation, achieved by a surreptitious addition or subtraction of an item during the spatial transformation.    Results indicated that nonconservers who understood the numerical significance of one-to-one correspondence were able to make use of counting information to solve conservation problems involving larger set sizes to a greater extent than those who did not understand the numerical significance of one-to-one correspondence relations. In addition, the results revealed that nonconservers who did not demonstrate the ability to produce one-to-one correspondence used counting information to form conservation judgments to a greater extent on small than on large number conservation trials. The two groups of conservers did not differ in their ability to recognize and/or explain the evidence of apparent nonconservation. However, conservers who gave less mature justifications were more able to recognize and/or explain the apparent nonconservation on small than on larger number conservation trials.    The results are discussed with respect to factors that constrain the role of empirical operations, such as counting, in the child's formation of logical concepts, such as conservation. The implications for the present findings for models of counting/number conservation relations are also discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, research findings are inconsistent, making it difficult to compare results across studies. There are several reasons for this inconsistency. Firstly, most studies make no distinction between ADHD subtypes, despite evidence that predominantly inattentive ADHD (ADHD/I) represents a different neurocognitive profile to the hyperactive-impulsive subtype (ADHD/HI). Secondly, documented studies use different tests of working memory which may be measuring different skills. Some assess only the verbal components of working memory and others the visuo-spatial; few of the tests assess both. Further, some tests employ a recognition methodology and others use recall, which require different brain regions and cognitive processes. To clarify these inconsistencies, the verbal and visuo-spatial working memory of children with ADHD/I, ADHD/HI and a control group with no ADHD symptoms were compared. Method: The Automated Working Memory Assessment and Ravens Coloured Progressive Matrices were administered to 72 children (ADHD/I n = 27; ADHD/HI n = 25; control n = 20). Results: The ADHD groups performed similarly, but were significantly poorer than the control group in all aspects of working memory. Storage abilities were stronger than processing abilities, while verbal and visuo-spatial abilities were equally developed for all groups. Conclusion: ADHD-related deficits were apparent across working memory components, even when IQ was controlled for, suggesting a generalised impairment. © 2011 Copyright NISC Pty Ltd.

Most of the cases are associated with maternally derived interstitial duplication involving 15q11-13. This case report describes a female proband with a maternally derived interstitial duplication of proximal 15q. She did not exhibit any symptoms of ASD apart from some developmental delay. By adolescence, she showed mild dysmorphism, a discrepant profile on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Verbal IQ = 87; Performance IQ = 65) and a major deficit in visual-spatial abilities affecting fine motor skills, mathematical reasoning, visual memory and some global reading tasks. This is one of the first reports of a child with a maternal duplication who exhibits a visual-spatial deficit without ASD. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Although a number of theories have been advanced to explain the development of spatial ability and to explain the reasons for differential spatial ability between the sexes, none can be considered definitive.    Biological explanations have suggested that genetic sex-linkage and effects of hormones and brain lateralization could account for this difference. Some investigators have reported significant effects of training on spatial ability. Experience may thus be a major factor in the development of spatial ability, and the home environment is the major source of experience during infancy and childhood.    The rationale for the present study was the lack of research on the influence of environment on the development of spatial ability. An attempt was made to assess whether differential spatial ability within the female sex is related to variability in measured characteristics of the home environment.    The spatial home environment variable was defined by a set of five process characteristics. Similar measures of the verbal home environment variable were included for discriminant validation of the spatial environment measure.    To measure the specific components of the spatial home environment, an instrument was developed. It consisted of an interview schedule and a set of rating scales. Spatial and verbal scores from the home environment instrument were correlated with DAT spatial and verbal subtest scores.    The subjects were 60 eighth and ninth grade females from a middle income community. Interviews with one or both of the parents of each of the 60 subjects were conducted in their homes. After the interview data were obtained, the environmental process characteristics were rated. After all ratings had been made, the two environmental process variable ratings for each home were computed by summing the respective associated environmental process characteristic ratings.    The first research question was: Can the spatial home environment be measured in such a way that it can be differentiated from those aspects of the home environment that have been shown to relate to the development of verbal ability? An analysis of median intercorrelations showed that the environmental process characteristics hypothesized to represent the spatial home environment were more highly related to each other than they were to the verbal environment characteristics.    The second research question was: Is spatial ability in eighth-grade females related to various characteristics of the spatial home environment? The results obtained clearly demonstrated a strong relationship between the spatial environment ratings and the eighth-grade DAT spatial subtest scores.    The present research successfully identified a subenvironment related to the development of spatial ability. Although there is a relationship between the spatial and verbal environments themselves, the dynamic aspects of the spatial environment were shown to differ from those previously identified and related to the development of other cognitive abilities.

Affected individuals develop female-like sexual orientation (attraction to males) and female-typical cerebral organization that is reflected in visual-spatial abilities and gender nonconformity. Handedness and pubertal timing were also assessed because they are sexually dimorphic and may be influenced by early gonadal hormone exposure.    Sexual identity labels were accurate reflections of reported attractions, fantasies, orgasm fantasies, and sexual behavior—as measured by revised Kinsey scales and pie charts—indicating that discrete categories are parsimonious and functional means of characterizing sexual orientation. Emotional preference was related to, but distinct from, sexual orientation. Unlike heterosexual and bisexual males, gays were emotionally closer to males than females. This is explained by gain-loss theory.   Modest support was obtained for the perinatal hormone theory, particularly among bisexuals. Gays, and to a lesser extent bisexuals, recalled less childhood masculinity and more femininity than heterosexuals suggesting a common biological mediator for hormoeroticism and gender atypicality. Childhood gender conformity and current homoeroticism were successfully predicted only for bisexuals and heterosexuals. Among bisexuals, poorer visual-spatial performance predicted decreased childhood masculinity and increased attraction to males. Among heterosexuals, childhood femininity predicted attractions to males. Pubertal timing and handedness did not distinguish the groups and were not predictable.    Findings support the overall thesis that numerous paths exist to the development of a same-sex sexual orientation. If the perinatal hormone theory contributes to a generalized feminization of the brain, the current data suggest that this occurs for some bisexuals and, to a very limited extent, heterosexuals. In contrast, evidence of cerebral feminization among gay males was only reflected in childhood gender atypicality, but this could not be predicted by other variables that reflect cerebral feminization. This suggests that unspecified mechanisms responsible for homoeroticism in gays may be different from the ones that produce same-sex attractions in bisexuals and heterosexuals and may have little affect on other components of cerebral feminization.

Archives of sexual behavior	https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1014043504661	Moderate support was obtained in a sample of 101 gay, bisexual, and heterosexual males for the perinatal hormone theory, which hypothesizes that attenuated levels of  androgens during critical periods of male fetal development fail to masculinize and  defeminize the brain. Affected individuals develop female-typical sexual orientation  (assessed here by a pie chart) and cerebral organization, reflected in  visual-spatial abilities and gender nonconformity. Handedness, also thought to  reflect in utero hormone exposure, was evaluated. Gay and bisexual males reported  greater femininity and lesser masculinity than heterosexuals, with bisexuals  intermediate in masculinity, suggesting a common biological mediator for  homoeroticism and sex atypicality. Among bisexual males, increased masculinity was  related to enhanced performance on all spatial tasks. Group mean differences in  spatial ability and handedness were not found; however, among bisexuals, poorer  visual-spatial performance predicted increased homoeroticism and right-handedness  positively correlated with all spatial tasks. If perinatal hormones contribute to a  generalized feminization of the brain, the current data indicate that it is most  apparent among bisexual males. Sexing of their brains may involve several sexually  dimorphic regions that are related in a continuous manner. Inferred cerebral  feminization was more circumscribed among gay and heterosexual males, for whom  childhood sex atypicality was most highly-distinguishing. Unspecified mechanisms  responsible for homoeroticism in them may differ from those that produce same-sex  attractions in bisexuals and thus have relatively little impact on other components  of cerebral feminization.

Alcohol research & health : the journal of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism		Fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are underdiagnosed in general treatment settings. Among the factors involved in identifying the effects of  prenatal alcohol exposure are (1) the evidence for prenatal alcohol exposure; (2)  the effects of the postnatal, caregiving environment; (3) comorbidities; and (4)  differential diagnosis, which includes identifying the neurodevelopmental effects of  alcohol and discriminating these effects from those characterizing other conditions.  This article reviews findings on the neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal alcohol  exposure, including learning and memory, motor and sensory/motor effects,  visual/spatial skills, and executive functioning and effortful control. Encouraging  clinicians to discriminate the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure from other  conditions may require more education and training but ultimately will improve  outcomes for affected children.

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	https://doi.org/10.1080/09297049.2021.1919298	Effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are rarely measured in preschool children due to relative insensitivity of assessment methods at this age. To examine the  potential of a nonverbal battery in early identification of cognitive problems in  alcohol-exposed children, 291 prospectively identified Ukrainian children were  evaluated using a test battery focusing on early executive functioning (EF) and  visuospatial skills, areas of cognitive development particularly sensitive to PAE in  older children. Tests included the Differential Ability Scales, 2(nd) Edition  (DAS-2) and several NEPSY/NEPSY-II subtests, standardized in the United States.  Others were adapted from commonly used non-standardized neuropsychological measures  of EF (Preschool Spatial Span, Imitation Hand Game, A not B, Delayed Attention,  Subject Ordered Pointing). Children in two sites in Ukraine, Rivne and Khmelnitsky,  were tested at 3 ½-4 ½ years to identify effects of PAE. Although most children  performed within the average range, Alcohol-Exposed preschoolers had lower scores on  DAS-II Summary Scores as well as on specific subtests. To evaluate the effects of  alcohol dose during the pre-pregnancy recognition period and during mid-gestation of  pregnancy, generalized linear regression models were used controlling for  demographic and individual variables. In addition to DAS-II variables, measures  reflecting sustained attention, working memory and ability to shift cognitive set  were impacted by alcohol dose. Early executive function appears to subsume these  performance differences. In conclusion, findings indicate that the effects of PAE  can be identified in the preschool period and reliably measured using tests  assessing nonverbal and spatial skills supported by executive functioning.

Factors contributing to spatial skills could include prenatal as well as experiential/cultural influences, with biological and social influences likely interacting and difficult to disentangle. This meta-analysis examined the potential influence of prenatal androgen exposure on spatial skill by examining studies of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH involves elevated adrenal androgens prenatally, with overall androgen concentrations higher for females with CAH versus same-sex controls but with little overall difference between males with CAH versus controls. We hypothesized that, if androgens contribute prenatally to neurobehavioral development in humans as in many other species, females with CAH would show spatial enhancement versus control females, but with no definitive hypothesis for males. Meta-analysis of 12 studies examining overall spatial skill and three spatial subcategories failed to support enhanced spatial performance for females with CAH; males with CAH showed lower spatial ability compared to control males, at least for the category of overall spatial skill. Although statistical logic precludes accepting the null hypothesis for females, the meta-analysis failed to support the idea that prenatal exposure to androgens explains spatial gender/sex differences in humans. Alternative explanations for average gender/sex differences in some spatial tasks could include androgen exposure at other times, such as mini-puberty, or different social factors experienced by males and females. We also discuss possible explanations for the different outcomes seen in females versus males with CAH. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

The present study examines the possibility that processing of VMS becomes automatized with written language training. In a sample of 139 Zairian children, separate factor analyses on K-ABC data for younger children (6.1- 8.5 years) and older children (8.6-12.8 years) yielded two-factor solutions in both cases, which appear to represent verbal and visual-spatial abilities. Modality specificity of the visual span task is supported in both age groups. Findings of modality specificity in both Zairian age groups provides support for the theoretical distinction between verbal and visual memory span. Continued modality specificity of visual memory span tasks in older Zairian children suggests that the increased verbal loadings of these tasks seen for older American children may reflect differences in written language development.

Arising from a review of the literature, a variety of hypotheses were examined through an empirical investigation with 481 children aged between 10 and 13 and drawn from a rural and an urban environment. The results of the study raise questions about the conceptual inadequacy and empirical validity of the style identified by Witkin and further whether the tests used to identify the style can explain performance on map and environmental exercises. The inter-correlations between the three measures of cognitive style used in the study were comparatively low (Embedded Figures Test (E2T) with Rod and Frame Test (RFT) 0.4290 p< 0.01, Embedded Figures Test with Articulation of Body Concept Scale (ABC) 0.4392 p <0.01, RFT with ABC 0.3448 D <0.01) and the most regularly used measure of this particular cognitive style in previous research (FT) correlated more highly with intelligence (0.5982 p <0.01) particularly perceptual reasoning (0.5616 p-<0.01) and spatial ability (0.7333 p<0.01) than with RFT and ABC. In the investigation of 25 specific research hypotheses, a more positive relationship was demonstrated with the result of the Embedded Figures Test than with those of the RFT and ABC and it is suggested that this can be explained in terms of general intellectual ability. Similarly performance on the measures of environmental perception and mapping skill employed in the study appeared to be considerably influenced by general intelligence and more especially perceptual reasoning. The strong spatial/intellectual bias of the relationships identified in the research were confirmed in a principal components and multiple regression analysis of the results. In a follow up study of a representative group of extreme analytic/field independent individuals and extreme global/field dependent individuals it was possible to identify children who demonstrated capacities as described by Witkin, which were not dependent upon ability. In general, however, intelligence was the major differentiating factor between the two groups. Specific findings related to each of the research hypotheses are discuesed in detail in the text. The main findings of the study, however, appear to question the existence of the cognitive style identified by Witkin and the expectation of an association between cognitive style and environmental perception was not confirmed.

It was found that the children showed a higher level of spatial competence than previous research had indicated, and that their spatial ability was dependent upon the nature of the environment. Euclidean knowledge was found at all ages in a familiar environment, but especially when familiarity was brought about through self-exploration. Euclidean knowledge was least likely in a novel environment. Previous experience with the test in the familiar environments did not lead to an increase in Euclidean knowledge in the novel environment.

Boys and  girls showed similar beneficial effects of training in addition to the benefit of  direct practice. The tendency that was observed for boys to perform higher than  girls on the pretest, p less than .10, was not evident on the posttest. Scores on  the pretest predicted scores on a different measure of visual-spatial ability only  for children in the control group. The results are interpreted in terms of current  theories of sex differences in visual-spatial perception.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Thus, efficient simulation is rather independent from current sensorimotor information. Here, we tested the impact of bodily (sensorimotor) information on simulation skills of adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Typically-developing (TD) and ASD participants judged laterality of hand images while keeping one arm flexed on chest or while holding both arms extended. Both groups were able to mentally simulate actions, but this ability was constrained by body posture more in ASD than in TD adolescents. The strong impact of actual body information on motor simulation implies that simulative skills are not fully effective in ASD individuals. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Embodied processes in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have classically been investigated in studies on imitation. Several observations suggested that unlike typical individuals who are able of copying the model's actions from the model's position, individuals with ASD tend to reenact the model's actions from their own egocentric perspective. Here, we performed two behavioral experiments to directly test the ability of ASD individuals to adopt another person's point of view. In Experiment 1, participants had to explicitly judge the left/right location of a target object in a scene from their own or the actor's point of view (visual perspective taking task). In Experiment 2, participants had to perform left/right judgments on front-facing or back-facing human body images (own body transformation task). Both tasks can be solved by mentally simulating one's own body motion to imagine oneself transforming into the position of another person (embodied simulation strategy), or by resorting to visual/spatial processes, such as mental object rotation (nonembodied strategy). Results of both experiments showed that individual with ASD solved the tasks mainly relying on a nonembodied strategy, whereas typical controls adopted an embodied strategy. Moreover, in the visual perspective taking task ASD participants had more difficulties than controls in inhibiting other-perspective when directed to keep one's own point of view. These findings suggested that, in social cognitive tasks, individuals with ASD do not resort to embodied simulation and have difficulties in cognitive control over self- and other-perspective. © 2015 International Society for Autism Research and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In recent years, it has been suggested that ASD is related to a dysfunction of action simulation processes, but studies employing imitation or action observation tasks provided mixed results. Here, we addressed action simulation processes in adolescents with AS by means of a motor imagery task, the classical hand laterality task (to decide whether a rotated hand image is left or right); mental rotation of letters was also evaluated. As a specific marker of action simulation in hand rotation, we assessed the so-called biomechanical effect, that is the advantage for judging hand pictures showing physically comfortable versus physically awkward positions. We found the biomechanical effect in typically-developing participants but not in participants with AS. Overall performance on both hand laterality and letter rotation tasks, instead, did not differ in the two groups. These findings demonstrated a specific alteration of motor imagery skills in AS. We suggest that impaired mental simulation and imitation of goal-less movements in ASD could be related to shared cognitive mechanisms. © 2013 Conson et al.

Experimental brain research	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-013-3456-x	Motor imagery has been investigated in childhood and early adolescence, but not across adolescence stages; moreover, available evidence did not clarify whether the  involvement of motor information in mental rotation of body parts becomes stronger  or weaker during development. In the present study, we employed the hand laterality  task to assess motor imagery in ninety-seven typically developing adolescents  divided into three age groups (i.e., 11-12, 14-15, and 17-18 years); mental rotation  of objects and letters were also assessed. As a specific marker of the motor  involvement in mental rotation of body parts, we assessed the so-called  biomechanical effect, that is, the advantage for judging hand pictures showing  physically comfortable positions with respect to hand pictures showing physically  impossible or awkward positions. Results demonstrated that the biomechanical effect  did not significantly affect early adolescents' performance, whereas it became  significant in 14- to 15-year-old participants and even more stronger in 17- to  18-year-old participants; this pattern did not depend on an increase in processing  speed to mentally rotate both corporeal and non-corporeal (objects and letters)  stimuli. The present findings demonstrated that: (1) motor imagery undergoes a  continuous and progressive refinement throughout adolescence, and (2) full  exploitation of motor information to mentally transform corporeal stimuli can be  attained in late adolescence only.

These influences were initially identified in experimental research on nonhuman species. Additional research—primarily investigating individuals exposed to atypical hormone environments due to genetic disorders or maternal treatment with hormones during pregnancy—suggested that testosterone also influences the development of sex-typical behavior in humans. There is also interest in identifying relations between normal variability in the early hormone environment and normal variability in subsequent behavior. This article reviews studies that have assessed prenatal testosterone exposure in typically developing children using amniotic fluid sampling or maternal blood sampling. It concludes that both these approaches are promising, but both require larger samples than those used in most studies to date. Recommendations for future research also include using outcome measures that show sex differences, analyzing data within each sex, considering the time of day (as well as the time of gestation) when samples were taken, and reporting all the measures evaluated, not just those showing significant effects.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12613	Some cognitive abilities exhibit reliable gender differences, with females outperforming males in specific aspects of verbal ability, and males showing an  advantage on certain spatial tasks. Among these cognitive gender differences,  differences in mental rotation are the most robust, and appear to be present even in  infants. A large body of animal research suggests that gonadal hormones,  particularly testosterone, during early development could contribute to this gender  difference in mental rotation. Also, substantial evidence supports an influence of  socialization on mental rotation performance. The present study investigated the  relationship of two types of factors, early postnatal testosterone exposure and  parental attitudes about gender, to mental rotation performance in 61 healthy  infants (29 males, 32 females). We measured salivary testosterone at two time  points: 1-2.5 months of age and 5-6 months of age. Infants' mental rotation  performance and parents' attitudes about gender were assessed at 5-6 months of age.  As predicted, testosterone concentrations were significantly higher in boys than  girls in early infancy (d = 0.54), and boys performed significantly better than  girls on mental rotation (d = 0.64). A significant positive correlation between  testosterone at age 1-2.5 months and mental rotation was found only in boys (r =  0.50, p = .01). A significant negative correlation between parents'  gender-stereotypical attitudes and mental rotation performance was found only in  girls (r = -.57, p = .002). These findings suggest that the early postnatal  testosterone surge (also known as "mini-puberty") may have organizational influences  on mental rotation performance in boys, and that parents may influence their  daughters' mental rotation abilities beginning very early in life.

The subjects were 9 to 11 year old boys identified as "Learning Disabled" by certified assessment specialists in the Metropolitan Nashville School System.    Subjects completed a paired-associate task proposed in past research to discriminate between students whose reading comprehension skills would increase with a visual imagery strategy. In addition, a single subject, multiple baseline design was used to demonstrate the effect of practice in generating descriptive visual images while completing either a reading or listening comprehension task.    Results suggest no significant effect for the imagery strategy for the reading comprehension task and only a possible effect for the listening comprehension task. Observational data however, suggested that the reading task was less compatible with an imagery strategy than the listening task. The paired-associate task was not a predictive instrument for these students.    Possible variables which might account for the differential effect of imagery with listening and reading comprehension were discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology	https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.1996.14.10.2826	PURPOSE: A prospective study was conducted to assess the effects of chemotherapy for cancer on children's long-term neuropsychologic status. PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Ninety-nine children who received no cranial radiation therapy (CRT) completed four  annual neuropsychologic assessments. Fifty-one patients received intrathecal (IT)  chemotherapy (ITC); 48 received no CNS treatment. These two groups were compared  using repeated-measures analysis of variance on IQ, memory, language, freedom from  distractibility, academic achievement, executive functions, and fine-motor,  perceptual-motor, and tactile-spatial skills. In addition, 51 of the sample of 99  patients had been examined 5 to 11 years after diagnosis. Their data were analyzed  to evaluate the longer-term effects of chemotherapy. The predictability of  demographic and medical variables on neuropsychologic outcome at 3-year and  long-term follow-up study were assessed using multiple regression techniques.  RESULTS: Overall, the effects of chemotherapy in the absence of CRT appear to be  slight. Patients who received ITC and intravenous (IV) methotrexate declined  slightly on perceptual-motor skills, but were still well within the normal range.  Both groups, regardless of treatment, declined on academic achievement tests,  although not to a statistically significant degree. Age effects were found on  performance IQ (PIQ) and perceptual-motor skills. Socioeconomic status (SES)  correlated with a large number of variables. Sex effects were not significant.  CONCLUSION: The present results are largely consistent with previous findings for  nonirradiated groups. Treatment effects from ITC are slightly more apparent 5 to 11  years after diagnosis than at 3-year follow-up evaluation but this does not  constitute a clinically meaningful difference. More noticeable are academic declines  among all groups, regardless of treatment.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0010-9452(85)80028-9	Normal and reading disabled children, aged from 11 to 13 years and matched for I.Q., were timed as they discriminated bs from ds. When the letters were presented only in  their normal upright orientations, normal readers responded more quickly when they  were presented in the right than in the left visual hemifield, while the disabled  readers showed a slight but insignificant left hemifield advantage. When the letters  were presented in varying angular orientations the reaction times indicated that  both groups "mentally rotated" an internal representation of each letter to the  upright in order to discriminate them. The two groups did not differ in the accuracy  of discrimination or in the estimated rate of mental rotation, and there were no  significant hemifield differences in this phase of the experiment. These data offer  no support for the view that disabled readers are deficient in spatial ability, but  confirm earlier evidence that they may suffer a lack of left-hemispheric  specialization.

Factors considered were: spatial ability, spatial toy usage, ethnicity, and parental perceptions.    The research and literature review indicates that achievement in geometry is related to spatial ability. Researchers recommend that the role of spatial toys in the development of spatial ability should be studied. The role of parental perceptions of their daughter's mathematical ability has been determined to be an important factor in mathematical achievement. Ethnic differences concerning achievement in geometry are not directly addressed in the literature.    The two hundred sixteen female students taking geometry in three high schools in the Dade County (Florida) Public Schools participated in the study. The instruments used for assessing geometry achievement and spatial ability were the 1986 Dade County Geometry Test Form 4 and the Developing Cognitive Abilities Test, respectively. Questionnaire and survey instruments were used to obtain information regarding parental perceptions, ethnicity and spatial toy usage during early childhood. A Likert scale was utilized to report frequency of toy usage.    T-test, Pearson correlation coefficient, Chi Square test for independence and ANOVA were used to examine the existence of possible differences and relationships among the variables. Results of the study indicated: (1) no significant differences between high and low spatial ability groups on self-reported toy usage; (2) a significant relationship between geometry achievement and spatial ability; (3) no significant differences between high and low geometry achievers on their reported use of spatial toys; (4) a difference in geometry achievement between White non-Hispanic and Hispanic students; (5) a strong positive relationship between parental perceptions of their daughter's achievement and the student's performance in geometry.    Further research is necessary to clarify the role of toys on the development of spatial ability and geometry achievement.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

New findings about sustained attention in normal families.	Psychiatry research	https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-1781(88)90076-5	Thirty families, consisting of two parents and two adolescent children, were tested on a high-processing load Continuous Performance Test, the CPT-IP, which required  identification of identical stimulus pairs within a continuously presented series of  stimuli. The purpose of this study was to provide normative data for research  concerned with the role of attention in psychopathology, especially schizophrenia  and major affective disorder. Retest data collected from 23 of the 30 families  showed the CPT-IP to be a reliable measure of attention. A major developmental  effect was found in capacity to sustain attention to spatial vs. verbal stimuli,  which suggested that spatial skills are most developed during childhood and  adolescence, while verbal attentional skills tend to peak in adulthood. Factor  analysis and family transmission patterns further suggested that the two types of  attention (spatial and verbal) were independent and that each was heritable to some  degree. Experimental distraction did not disrupt performance in any of the subjects  and, in fact, tended to improve it in the adolescents, especially for spatial  stimuli. We conclude that the CPT-IP is appropriate for use with families containing  members differing widely in age and processing skills.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2017.09.006	Children's development of verbal number skills (i.e., counting abilities and knowledge of the number names) presents a milestone in mathematical development.  Different factors such as visuo-spatial and verbal abilities have been discussed as  contributing to the development of these foundational skills. To understand the  cognitive nature of verbal number skills in young children, the current study  assessed the relation of preschoolers' verbal and visuo-spatial abilities to their  verbal number skills. In total, 141 children aged 5 or 6 years participated in the  current study. Verbal number skills were regressed on vocabulary, phonological  awareness and visuo-spatial abilities, and verbal and visuo-spatial working memory  in a structural equation model. Only visuo-spatial abilities emerged as a  significant predictor of verbal number skills in the estimated model. Our results  suggest that visuo-spatial abilities contribute to a larger extent to children's  verbal number skills than verbal abilities. From a theoretical point of view, these  results suggest a visuo-spatial, rather than a verbal, grounding of verbal number  skills. These results are potentially informative for the conception of early  mathematics assessments and interventions.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The younger the age at which these kinds of difficulties are identified, the better the opportunity for successful intervention (Rourke, 1989). The present study systematically compared the simple and complex visuoperceptual and visual-spatial abilities of 6-year-old boys with NLD (n = 13) to a matched control group of boys with other learning disabilities (CLD) and to normative scores. A profile of strong average abilities on a simple discrimination task but relative visual-spatial weaknesses was unique to the NLD group, as was significantly poorer (p ≤ 5.01) performance on the mom complex mental rotation task. The visual processing abilities of children with NLD were positively associated with their arithmetic scores, but no significant correlations were found for the CLD group.

Remote computerized cognitive training (CCT) may be delivered to patients in ecological settings, ensuring rehabilitation continuity. This work evaluated cognitive and psychological adjustment outcomes of an 8-week multi-domain, home-based CCT (Lumosity Cognitive Training) in a sample of patients with ABI aged 11–16 years. Two groups of patients were engaged in five CCT sessions per week for eight weeks (40 sessions). According to a stepped-wedge research design, one group (Training-first Group) started the CCT immediately, whereas the other group (Waiting-first Group) started the CCT after a comparable time of waiting list. Changes after the training and after the waiting period were compared in the two groups. Both groups improved in visual-spatial working memory more after the training than after the waiting-list period. The Training-first group improved also in arithmetic calculation speed. Findings indicate that a multi-domain CCT can produce benefits in visual-spatial working memory, probably because, in accordance with previous research, computer games heavily tax visuo-spatial abilities. This suggests that the prolonged stimulation of the same cognitive ability may generate the greatest benefits in children with ABI. © 2020, The Author(s).

We tested it on  pediatric brain tumor survivors, comparing the abilities of 30 children and  adolescents (aged 8-16 years) surviving from a supratentorial tumor (STT) or an  infratentorial tumor (ITT) in two different tasks of body representation. Thirty  children with typical development (TD) served as control group. In the first task,  we tested configural (body inversion effect) and holistic (composite illusion  effect) processing of others' bodies. In the second task, we tested the ability to  perform first-person and object-based mental spatial transformations of own body and  external objects, respectively. Configural processing was spared in all patients.  Conversely, ITT, but not STT patients, were impaired in the holistic processing of  body stimuli. STT patients performed overall worse than both controls and ITT  patients at mental spatial transformations of both own body and external objects.  ITT children presented selective alteration in using the first-person transformation  strategies with body stimuli. Results suggest that body-representation abilities may  be heavily affected in pediatric brain tumor survivors. STTs may be associated to  greater difficulties in mental visuo-spatial transformation abilities, likely  reflecting damage to fronto-parietal circuits. Conversely, ITTs may be associated to  specific disturbances of visual body perception abilities that require motor  simulation processes, reflecting direct or indirect damage to cerebellar areas.

Additionally, there are current debates about the effectiveness of animations (or simulations) in promoting learning in multimedia settings. Objectives: As a result, the current study aimed to review eye tracking-based research on learners' cognitive processes in the animated/simulated multimedia learning domain. Method: For this purpose, fifty-seven (57) studies were systematically determined based on PRISMA guidelines, and they were synthesized. Results and Conclusions: The notable findings are that (1) most of the reviewed studies have tried to relate eye-tracking measures to at least one cognitive process (e.g., selecting, organizing, and integrating) which are assumed to take place during multimedia learning; (2) eye-tracking measurements show whether design features of animation are successful in directing learners' attention; (3) the success of animation in attention-guiding to the relevant parts may not have a positive impact on learning because individual differences (e.g., prior knowledge, spatial ability, or working capacity) and animation content are the other factors that directly affect the effectiveness of animation over learning. Implications: The current study implies that (i) use of signaling cues in animated multimedia settings diminish visual search and promote higher learning scores, (ii) giving users control over animations causes negative outcomes (e.g., missing micro or macro events); (iii) research on animated multimedia learning should be replicated with the participant group from K-12, special education (e.g., autistic children), and elders. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

After questioning such interpretations and providing alternative explanations, it describes selected experimental studies that were focused on the causal relationship between music instruction and intellectual prowess. The results of the many studies that observed children for a short period of time (i.e., up to one year), have shown convincing evidence that there are temporary cognitive benefits associated with music instruction. Such benefits include improvements in general IQ, spatial skills, and verbal tasks. Additionally, learning music produces structural and functional changes in the brain. Such changes are associated with improvements in sound processing, motor skill, and melodic and rhythmic discrimination. However, neurological investigations do not support the claim that music makes children smarted as the results have failed to show any neurological changes associated with improvements in IQ. © Oxford University Press 2012.

There were no differences in cognitive abilities, musical abilities, motor proficiency, self-esteem, academic achievement, or interest in studying piano between the two groups of children at the beginning of the study. It was found that the treatment affected children's general and spatial cognitive development. The magnitude of such effects (omega squared) was small. Additional analyses showed that although the experimental group obtained higher spatial abilities scores in the Developing Cognitive Abilities Test after 1 and 2 years of instruction than did the control group, the groups did not differ in general or specific cognitive abilities after 3 years of instruction. The treatment did not affect the development of quantitative and verbal cognitive abilities. © 1999 by MENC-The National Association for Music Education.

For infants and toddlers, whose cognitive, fine motor, and executive functions are immature, several basic questions are significant: (1) Can they operate a tablet purposefully to achieve a goal? (2) Can they acquire operating skills and learn new information from commercially available apps? (3) Do individual differences in executive functioning predict success in using and learning from the apps? Accordingly, 31 2-year-olds (M = 30.82 month, SD = 2.70; 18 female) were compared with 29 3-year-olds (M = 40.92 month, SD = 4.82; 13 female) using two commercially available apps with different task and skill requirements: (1) a shape matching app performed across 3 days, and (2) a storybook app with performance compared to that on a matched paper storybook. Children also completed (3) the Minnesota Executive Functioning Scale. An adult provided minimal scaffolding throughout. The results showed: (1) toddlers could provide simple goal-directed touch gestures and the manual interactions needed to operate the tablet (2) after controlling for prior experience with shape matching, toddlers’ increased success and efficiency, made fewer errors, decreased completion times, and required less scaffolding across trials, (3) they recognized more story content from the e-book and were less distracted than from the paper book, (4) executive functioning contributed unique variance to the outcome measures on both apps, and (5) 3-year-olds outperformed 2-year-olds on all measures. The results are discussed in terms of the potential of interactive devices to support toddlers’ learning. © Copyright © 2021 Courage, Frizzell, Walsh and Smith.

We report two experiments in which children aged 7, 9 and 11 years were submitted to mental rotation tasks of unfamiliar stimuli. Three unfamiliar shapes composed of four arms were used. For each shape, there was a version with a salient axis (S+) and a version with no salient axis (S-). In experiment one, the reference stimulus always pointed to 0° and the angular disparity with the other stimulus was 0°, 60°, 120° and 180°. In experiment two, the procedure was the same as in experiment 1 except that the reference stimulus could point either to 0° or to 60°. Results of experiment one were congruent with those of Courbois (2000) and suggested that the ability to rotate mentally unfamiliar figures with no salient axis improves with age. Results of experiment two suggested that young children had great difficulty performing the mental rotation task when none of the stimuli was aligned with the vertical direction.

Any mistake in the determination of this system results in an error in the kind of transformation that is imagined. In the present experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the ability to define reference systems increased with age. We analysed the number of transformation errors made by 6- and 10-year-old children in two mental rotation tasks, using stimuli with and without salient axis (Courbais, 2000). Results showed that these errors only occurred when the stimuli had no salient axis, and that the number of these errors decreased significantly with age.

The stimuli contained either an intrinsic salient axis (S+) or no salient axis (S-). Results showed that both 5-year-old and 8-year-old children were able to perform the mental rotation task with the S + stimulus. However, 5-year-old children had difficulties in performing the mental rotation task with the S- stimulus. These results suggest that there are limitations in mental rotation abilities of young children. The ability to encode and mentally rotate unfamiliar stimuli containing no salient axis seems to improve between the ages of 5 and 8.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Hormones and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.12.007	The present study used an intensive longitudinal design to examine whether mental rotation performance varies according to a monthly cycle in both males and females  and whether these variations are related to variations in progesterone, estradiol,  and testosterone levels. We collected reaction time and accuracy data for 10 males  and seven females each workday over eight weeks using 136 pairs of mental rotation  stimuli/day, and measured sexual hormones concentrations in the saliva twice a week.  A mixed linear model statistical analysis revealed that all females and seven males  showed significant cycle effects in mental rotation performance. The female cycle  showed an amplitude that was twice as large compared with the amplitude found in  males. For males and females, estradiol and testosterone were significantly linearly  and quadratically related to interindividual variation in performance at the  beginning of the study (progesterone was linearly related to performance for  females). The association between testosterone and performance differed across  sexes: for males, it had an inverse U-shape, for females it was U-shaped. Towards  the end of the study, none of the hormones were significantly related to performance  anymore. Thus, the relationship between hormones and mental rotation performance  disappeared with repeated testing. Only estradiol levels were significantly elevated  at the lowest point of the cycle in mental rotation performance in females. In  conclusion, in this intensive longitudinal study spanning two months, a monthly  cycle in mental rotation performance was found among both males and females, with a  larger cycle's amplitude for females.

Groups of 11-year-old boys were tested in the UK and in India on three tests of spatial ability. There were no significant differences in performance among boys born in the UK of UK or Indian origin. In general, performance of boys in India was lower but was worst among recent immigrants in the UK. A number of factors may have contributed to this result, but the finding suggests that it is the problems associated with recent immigration rather than any innate deficit that leads to poor test performance. © 1982, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Likewise, the gifted may become STEM innovators, but they are rarely provided with pedagogy appropriate to develop their abilities in schools. A stratified random sample of volunteer participants (n=75) ages 9-14 was drawn from 16 public school districts' gifted programs, including as many females (n=28) and children from groups traditionally underrepresented in gifted programs (n=18) as available. Participants were randomly divided into an experimental (n=38) and a control group (n=37) for an intervention study. All participants took the CogAT (form 6) Verbal Battery and the Project TALENT Spatial Ability Assessments. The experimental group participated in a simulation of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) competition for 20 hours total over five consecutive days. All participants took the spatial measure another time. Experimental males evidenced significant and meaningful gains in measured spatial ability (Cohen's d = 0.87). Females did not evidence significant gains in measured spatial ability. This may be due to sampling error, gender differences in prior experience with LEGO, or differences in facets of spatial ability in the treatment or measurements. Further research studies with larger samples of females, other treatments and measurement tools, and longer treatment periods are recommended. The literature review revealed that FLL is beneficial for STEM engagement in both genders and its use in schools is recommended. The present study provides additional evidence for FLL's usefulness in increasing the number of individuals in the STEM pipeline.

Hemispheric specialization was less noticeable for the younger hearing group, but the task may have been too difficult. A slight right-hand superiority was found in the performance of adults with long presentation time. This may reflect the simplicity of the task for these subjects.

To test an application of this possibility, 120 lower SES adolescent school children, whose reading comprehension was 3 to 4 years behind that of their same-aged peers on a nationally normed reading test, were assigned randomly to one of three experimental conditions in a 6-week remedial reading program. One group received only remedial reading instruction; a second, reading instruction plus spatial skills training; and a third group served as an untreated control. Respondents’ gains on space relations and abstract reasoning skills (measured by the Differential Aptitude Tests [DAT]) and on four aspects of skilled reading (speed, accuracy, vocabulary, and comprehension) supported the hypothesis: Significant differences favoring the spatially trained respondents over the other two groups were observed on almost all measures.

Here, an 'own body transformation' paradigm and a letter transformation task were employed in a group of children ranging from 7 to 11 years of age to respectively investigate the development of egocentric perspective transformations and object-related transformations. A group of 30 young adults was also administered the 2 experimental tasks. Moreover, the Temperament and Character Inventory (Cloninger, Przybeck, Svrakic, & Wetzel, 1994) was also administered to children and adults with the goal of testing for possible influences of personality traits on imagined perspective transformation abilities. We found that egocentric perspective transformations develop later than object-based transformations—namely, from 8 rather than 7 years of age. We also found that high scores on temperament and character scales reflecting the acceptance of others (i.e., cooperativeness) were positively related to the ability to engage in imagined perspective transformations, especially when such ability first appears (i.e., at 8 years of age). These findings were held to support the view that the 2 mental spatial transformation systems are separated in that they follow 2 different developmental trajectories and are differentially influenced by personality traits in children.

Research in developmental disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2018.06.007	BACKGROUND: Previous research suggests that children with cerebral palsy (CP) have impairments in visual-spatial and mathematics abilities, although we know very  little about the association between these two domains. AIMS: To investigate the  extent of visual-spatial and mathematical impairments in children with CP and the  associations between these two domains. METHOD AND PROCEDURE: Thirty-two children  with predominantly quadriplegic spastic and/or athetoid (dyskinetic) CP (13 years 7  months) and a group of typically developing (TD) children (8 years 6 months) matched  by receptive vocabulary were given a battery of visual-spatial and mathematics  tasks. Visual-spatial assessments ranged from simple tests of perception to complex  reasoning about these stimuli. A standardised test of mathematics ability was  administered to both groups. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The children with CP had  significantly poorer mathematical and visual-spatial abilities than the TD group.  For the TD group age was the best predictor of mathematical ability, in the CP group  receptive vocabulary and visual perception abilities were the best predictors of  mathematical ability. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The CP group had extensive  difficulties with visual perception; visual short-term memory; visual reasoning; and  mental rotation all of which were associated with their mathematical abilities.  These findings have implications for the teaching of visual perception and visual  memory skills in young children with CP as these may help the development of  mathematical abilities.

Method: Subjects were 56 children (29 AE, 27 CON) who were administered measures of global mathematics achievement (WRAT-3 Arithmetic & WISC-III Written Arithmetic), attention, (WISC-III Digit Span forward and Spatial Span forward), working memory (WISC-III Digit Span backward and Spatial Span backward), and visual memory (CANTAB Spatial Recognition Memory and Pattern Recognition Memory). The contribution of cognitive domains to mathematics achievement was analyzed using linear regression techniques. Attention, working memory, and visual memory data were entered together on Step 1 followed by group on Step 2, and the interaction terms on Step 3. Results: Model 1 accounted for a significant amount of variance in both mathematics achievement measures; however, model fit improved with the addition of group on Step 2. Significant predictors of mathematics achievement were Spatial Span forward and backward and Spatial Recognition Memory. Conclusions: These findings suggest that deficits in spatial processing may be related to math impairments seen in FASD. In addition, prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with deficits in mathematics achievement, above and beyond the contribution of general cognitive abilities. © 2014 American Psychological Association.

This is obvious for geometry which is ostensibly spatial and requires creating, maintaining, and performing transformations on 2-D or 3-D visuospatial models. However, it is also the case for other mathematical dimensions. Understanding the place-value system of Arabic numbers for instance requires the processing of the position of each digit in the number. Doing multi-digit calculation in columns similarly involves the processing of spatial information; and the use of visual images has been shown to be positively correlated with higher mathematical word-problem-solving performance (Van Garderen 2006). Globally, numerous researchers have found close connection between spatial thinking and mathematics (Mix and Cheng 2012) with good math abilities in people with higher spatial skills. In the first part of this chapter, we will examine evidence showing that number magnitude is spatially coded. Then, we will show that the spatial representation of numbers improves with age. Third, we will report the effects of weak visuo-spatial abilities on numerical development in children. Finally, we will consider how this space-number interaction has been considered in training aiming at fostering numerical development. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of a standardised program versus current individualized therapy in patients with homonymous hemianopia. METHODS: Single-blind randomized controlled trial, 24 patients (54% male), mean age (65±4.3), mean time since stroke (51±52.3 days), recruited from rehabilitation and vision services in Adelaide, Australia. Participants were randomized to a combined standardized scanning and mobility program of 7 weeks, 3 times per week or to individualized therapy recommended by clinicians. Primary outcome was an assessment of scanning ability whilst walking. Secondary outcomes included measures of visual scanning, reading, and vision related quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: No significant differences were found between intervention groups for the primary outcome measure of scanning ability whilst walking at 7 weeks and at 3 months (P > 0.05). However, at 3 months significant differences were found for the QOL National Eye Institute Visual functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ25) total score (P = 0.03) and dependency sub-score (P = 0.03) measures. CONCLUSIONS: A standardized intervention of static scanning and mobility training improved QOL. Allocation of resources to visual rehabilitation services point towards the implementation of more mobility practice over a longer period of time. © 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

This may be largely due to well-known anatomical and muscle-physiological differences that play a central role in overarm throwing. With the objective to understand the potential contribution of the equally essential coordinative aspects in throwing for this gender difference, this large cross-sectional study examined a simplified forearm throw that eliminated the requirements that give males an advantage.While the overall performance error indeed became similar in the age groups younger than 20 years and older than 50 years, it was attenuated for middle-aged individuals. The gender differences remained in individuals who reported no throwing experience, but females with throwing experience reached similar performance as males. Two fine-grained spatiotemporal metrics displayed similar age-dependent gender disparities: while overall, males showed better spatiotemporal coordination of the ball release, age group comparisons specified that it was particularly middle-aged females that made more timing errors and did not develop a noise-tolerant strategy as males did. As throwing experience did not explain this age-dependency, the results are discussed in the context of spatial abilities and video game experience, both more pronounced in males. In contrast, a measure of rhythmicity developed over successive throws only revealed weak gender differences, speaking to the fundamental tendency in humans to fall into rhythmic patterns. Only the youngest individuals between 5 and 9 years of age showed significantly less rhythmicity in their performance. This computational study was performed in a large cohort in the context of an outreach activity, demonstrating that robust quantitative measures can also be obtained in less controlled environments. The findings also alert that motor neuroscience may need to pay more attention to gender differences. © 2019 Crozier, Zhang, Park and Sternad.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

More specifically, the study used two cognitive measures, the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children and the Embedded Figures Test, and examined the influence that 23 family variables and cultural background (acculturation) had on measures of spatial abilities.    Past studies suggested that American Indian children, as a group, perform above the standardization sample on measures of visual-spatial skills, have higher Simultaneous Processing skills, and are more field independent. It was anticipated that at least 40% of the children tested in this study would have statistically significant discrepancy scores in favor of the Simultaneous scale and have an effect size of.40 or above on subtests reported to measure visual-spatial skills. It was further hypothesized that the children of this study would be more field independent (reach an effect size of.67 or higher) and that the Embedded Figures Tests would have correlations of $r=.50$ or above with the total Simultaneous scale, Magic Windows, Gestalt Closure, Triangles, and Spatial Memory.    Results found that 40% of this sample did not obtain significant discrepancy scores, and only Gestalt Closure for the pre-school children and Spatial Memory for the school aged children reached an effect size of.40. In addition, only school aged children were considered more field independent, and field independent was associated with the total Simultaneous scale, the Mental processing Composite, the Achievement scale, and the following subtests: Triangles; Arithmetic; and, Reading/Understanding.    A principal-component analysis was conducted to determine the factor structure of the acculturation scale (the Rosebud Personal Opinion Survey). This analysis found that the survey lacked empirical support for the dimensions suggested by the authors and only the first component, Language-Ancestry, was a useful indicator of acculturation. Nine family variables and the Language-Ancestry component were used as independent variables accounted for or predicted the visual-spatial scores of American Indian children. None of the variable used reached a significance level of $p<.0056.$	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

To overcome such difficulties, we report here the exemplary design of a novel multisensory learning environment for teaching mathematical concepts based on meaningful inputs from elementary school teachers. First, we developed and administered a questionnaire to 101 teachers asking them to rate based on their experience the learning difficulty for specific arithmetical and geometrical concepts encountered by elementary school children. Additionally, the questionnaire investigated the feasibility to use multisensory information to teach mathematical concepts. Results show that challenging concepts differ depending on children school level, thus providing a guidance to improve teaching strategies and the design of new and emerging learning technologies accordingly. Second, we obtained specific and practical design inputs with workshops involving elementary school teachers and children. Altogether, these findings are used to inform the design of emerging multimodal technological applications, that take advantage not only of vision but also of other sensory modalities. In the present work, we describe in detail one exemplary multisensory environment design based on the questionnaire results and design ideas from the workshops: the Space Shapes game, which exploits visual and haptic/proprioceptive sensory information to support mental rotation, 2D–3D transformation and percentages. Corroborating research evidence in neuroscience and pedagogy, our work presents a functional approach to develop novel multimodal user interfaces to improve education in the classroom. © 2021, The Author(s).

While schizotypy is a well-established subject of research in adults, it has not been properly investigated in children.  A primary objective was therefore to undertake the first large-scale study of schizotypy in children, in order to assess whether it is measurable in a young population.  The factorial structure of the Junior STA scale used in this study proved very comparable to measurements of adult schizotypy suggesting that similar traits are measurable in children. The schizotypy scores of children correlated positively with those of their mothers; for fathers this relationship failed to reach significance.  This finding supports the idea that there is a familial effect in schizotypy. Handedness has also been investigated in adults in connection with schizotypy.  Contrary to predictions derived from adult studies, no relationships were found between handedness and schizotypy in the present sample of children.  Some parents also took part in the study, replicating an interesting finding made by Claridge et al. (1998):  the most mixed-handed parents were the lowest scoring subjects on schizotypy. The examination of handedness and cognitive function in children focused on spatial ability, phonological skill, and literacy skills.  The highest spatial abilities were demonstrated by slightly mixed-handed subjects, and phonological skills were better in right- versus left-handed writers.  Mixed-handers were better at reading than children with consistent hand preferences, and both reading and spelling were directly related to hand skill in general. The findings of this research also support the idea that high schizotypy is associated with low spatial ability.  No relationships were found between schizotypy and phonological skills.  Reading and spelling, however, showed some interesting interactions with schizotypy and sex:  in females schizotypy was positively correlated with reading, whereas in males it was negatively correlated with spelling. While results regarding handedness remain inconclusive, the main findings of this thesis are that schizotypy is a measurable construct in young populations, exhibiting some familial effects and interactions with sex, reading, spelling, and spatial ability.

To test this hypothesis, specific cognitive abilities were compared for biological, adoptive, and nonadoptive parents and their 163 adopted and 142 nonadopted children tested at age 7 as part of the longitudinal Colorado Adoption Project. Model-fitting analyses support the hypothesis of significant genetic influence on verbal and spatial abilities but not on perceptual speed and memory. These results imply the existence of some genetic continuity from the early school years to adulthood for verbal and spatial abilities. In addition, genetic influence of parents on their children appears to increase from early childhood to middle childhood, accounting for about 25% of the variance of verbal and spatial abilities at age 7. In contrast, environmental resemblance between parents and offspring is nonsignificant for all four specific cognitive abilities as well as for a composite score representing general cognitive ability. Such shared environmental influence between parent and child accounts for less than 1% of the variance at age 7. © 1989 Ablex Publishing Corporation.

Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS	https://doi.org/10.1017/S135561770808106X	The goal of the current investigation was to examine adaptive behavior and cognitive skills in young children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a genetic disorder  that causes progressive muscular weakness and concomitant cognitive deficits.  Previous studies have documented specific language deficits in older children with  DMD, but there are limited data on younger children. Twenty children with DMD who  were between 3 and 6 years old and 20 unaffected family control children were  recruited. Parents completed questionnaires relating to development and adaptive  functioning, while children completed neuropsychological testing. Results of paired  t tests indicate that children with DMD are rated as delayed relative to familial  controls on measures of adaptive functioning, as assessed by the Vineland Adaptive  Behavior Scales. Furthermore, children with DMD exhibit impairments on multiple  measures of cognition, including measures of receptive language, expressive  language, visuo-spatial skills, fine-motor skills, attention, and memory skills.  Across all domains examined, the young children with DMD performed more poorly than  their familial controls. These deficits appear to be more generalized than those  reported in older children with this disorder. Dystrophin, a missing protein  product, is hypothesized to be responsible for these cognitive and behavioral  impairments.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

There are still not many experimental studies on the cognitive enhancement and social skills of children with special needs conducted with robotics construction kits that, requiring both the construction of the robot body and the programming of its "mind", bring into play a multiplicity of cognitive and social skills. For the aforementioned reasons our team from the University of Palermo and from the Center MetaIntelligenze ONLUS developed the treatment protocol RE4BES, which is a collection of guidelines for realizing robotics personalized activities for children with special needs. In this paper, two studies will be described concerning the first application of activities drawn from the RE4BES protocol. The first study concerns the use of the robotic construction kits for the stimulation of visuo-spatial abilities; in the second study the robot construction kits have been used to stimulate the attentional abilities in a child with severe difficulties on focused attention tasks. © 2019 by the authors.

This study was undertaken to analyze the epidemiology of CL in the municipality of Teodoro Sampaio, in São Paulo State, Brazil, based on a geographic approach, as very little is known of the relationship between CL and the spatial transformation process. Methods: This is a population-based quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional case study. Surveys of the official notifications in the healthcare center and official sources from 1998 to 2011 were analysed. The data were described based on statistics and the Kernel method to detect hotspots of transmission. Results: The age group between 21 and 40 yr was most affected, with 24 cases (57.9%). Of the 41 cases reported between 1998 and 2011, 33 cases were having low education status and 31 cases (75.6%) were males. The spatial and temporal distribution was aggregated in three-year periods which permitted the identification of two microfoci, in periods I (1998–2000) and III (2005–2007). Interpretation & conclusion: The disease has presented, in recent years, a pattern of sporadic transmission or microfoci, and continues to maintain enzootic cycles of Leishmania in a sylvatic environment, ensuring the perpetuation of the pathogen in nature, and the risk of emergence of new cases of CL in domestic animals and humans. © 2014 Malaria Research Center.

Preschool outcomes compared with term peers	Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2010.03730.x	Aim: The aim of this study was to determine neuropsychological performance (possibly predictive of academic difficulties) and its relationship with cognitive development and maternal education in healthy preterm children of preschool age and age-matched comparison children born at term. Method: A total of 35 infants who were born at less than 33 weeks' gestational age and who were free from major neurosensory disability (16 males, 19 females; mean gestational age 29.4wk, SD 2.2wk; mean birthweight 1257g, SD 327g) and 50 term-born comparison children (25 males, 25 females; mean birthweight 3459g, SD 585g) were assessed at 4 years of age. Cognition was measured using the Griffiths Mental Development scales while neuropsychological abilities (language, short-term memory, visual-motor and constructive spatial abilities, and visual processing) were assessed using standardized tests. Multivariable regression analysis was used to explore the effects of preterm birth and sociodemographic factors on cognition, and to adjust neuropsychological scores for cognitive level and maternal education. Results: The mean total Griffiths score was significantly lower in preterm than in term children (97.4 vs 103.4; p<0.001). Factors associated with higher Griffiths score were maternal university education (β=6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-11.7) and having older siblings or a twin (β=4.0; 95% CI 0.5-7.6). At neuropsychological assessment, preterm children scored significantly lower than term comparison children in all tests except lexical production (Boston Naming Test) and visual-processing accuracy. After adjustment for cognitive level and maternal education, differences remained statistically significant for verbal fluency (p<0.05) and comprehension, short-term memory, and spatial abilities (p<0.01). Interpretation: Neuropsychological follow-up is also recommended for healthy very preterm children to identify strengths and challenges before school entry, and to plan interventions aimed at maximizing academic success. © The Authors.

Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria	https://doi.org/10.1590/s0004-282x1999000100015	The author reports three cases of pseudodementia and discuss the difficulties in establishing limits between normality and illness in the elderly. The mental and  neuropathological changes that accompany the normal ageing of the brain are similar  to those of early Alzheimer's dementia (AD). These similarities often lead to  difficulties in the differential diagnosis, hence the search for consensus criteria.  The decline of working and secondary memory is greater than that of primary and  tertiary memory, as is found in AD. On the other hand, tests of delayed recall of 10  to 15 unrelated words, logical memory, categorical thinking, visuo-motor-spatial  skills, and Boston Naming Test have been pointed out as the most discriminative.  Neuroimaging findings of atrophy or hypoperfusion in the entorhinal-hippocampal or  temporo-parietal regions are suggestive of DA, but they can be lacking in the early  stages of this disease. In the conclusion, the author suggests the diagnostic  process should be based on a comprehensive neuropsychological and behavioral  evaluation (including a survey of the subject's premorbid level of cognitive and  socio-occupational functioning), supplemented by neuroimaging and laboratory tests.  If inconclusive, the whole evaluation can be repeated after 4 to 6 months, to check  the consistency of the findings.	AE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		1	2	0	1	1	0	0	1

Epilepsy & behavior : E&B	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2019.01.038	OBJECTIVE: In adults with left-sided epilepsy, reorganized language may "crowd out" right-hemisphere visual-spatial skills, with relative sparing of language (i.e., the  crowding hypothesis). However, this effect has not consistently been demonstrated in  pediatric epilepsy studies. The objective of this study was to investigate the  crowding hypothesis using a heterogeneous sample of children with intractable  epilepsy and typical (left) language dominance or atypical (right or bilateral)  language dominance. We examined the relative contributions of seizure onset (before  or after age 5), handedness (right versus left), seizure localization (temporal  versus extratemporal), as well as language dominance on verbal versus visual  cognitive skills. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed neuropsychology assessment  results from a sample of 91 children who completed presurgical evaluation at the  Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada (34 with typical language, 57 with  atypical language, mean age = 12 years). We considered a selection of verbal skills  (naming, vocabulary knowledge, verbal abstract reasoning) and visual skills  (visual-motor integration, block construction, visual abstract reasoning). RESULTS:  Consistent with several previous adult studies supporting the crowding hypothesis,  univariate analyses showed that the typical and atypical language groups were  comparable on the measures of vocabulary knowledge and abstract verbal reasoning  whereas the atypical language group produced lower scores across visual measures.  Multivariate analyses (taking into account language dominance and associated  factors) showed that language dominance was the strongest predictor of performance  on two of three visual measures whereas language dominance was not a significant  predictor of performance on most verbal measures. Unexpectedly, both sets of  analyses indicated that the atypical language group had poorer naming abilities than  the typical language group. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data provide some evidence of  right-hemisphere functional crowding effects in a heterogeneous sample of children  with intractable left-sided epilepsy. Specifically, those with atypical versus  typical language dominance showed poorer visual-motor integration and visual-motor  problem-solving skills, with comparable scores on certain verbal measures. It is  critical that potential crowding effects be considered when interpreting the  neuropsychological profiles of children being evaluated for epilepsy surgery.

At the same time, the major fiber tract responsible for this interaction, the corpus callosum, shows a structural development across the lifespan which is over-proportional. That is, compared to changes in overall forebrain volume, the corpus callosum shows an accentuated growth during childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, as well as pronounced decline in older age. However, this over-proportionality of growth and decline along with potential consequences for cognition, have been largely overlooked in empirical research. In the present study we systematically address the proportionality of callosal development in a large mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal sample (1867 datasets from 1014 unique participants), covering the human lifespan (age range 4–93 years), and examine the cognitive consequences of the observed changes. Relative corpus callosum thickness was measured at 60 segments along the midsagittal surface, and lifespan trajectories were clustered to identify callosal subsections of comparable lifespan development. While confirming the expected inverted u-shaped lifespan trajectories, we also found substantial regional variation. Compared with anterior clusters, the most posterior sections exhibited an accentuated growth during development which extends well into the third decade of life, and a protracted decline in older age which is delayed by about 10 years (starting mid to late 50s). We further showed that the observed longitudinal changes in relative thickness of the mid splenium significantly mediates age-related changes in tests assessing verbal knowledge and non-verbal visual-spatial abilities across the lifespan. In summary, we demonstrate that analyzing the proportionality of callosal growth and decline offers valuable insight into lifespan development of structural connectivity between the hemispheres, and suggests consequences for the cognitive development of perception and cognition. © 2020 The Author(s)	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The topic of our research is the development of a so-called “geocentric” frame of spatial reference. This is a cognitive style, in which individuals describe and represent small-scale table-top space in terms of large-scale geographic dimensions. We explore the development with age of geocentric language and cognition, and the relationships between the two. We also explore the many environmental and socio-cultural variables that favor the use of this frame. We demonstrate how we untangled several of these variables by using a succession of within-society group comparisons, in several societies where a geocentric frame is in common usage (Bali, Indonesia, India, and Nepal). Our research program unfolds like a detective story, where one finding that is difficult to interpret because of several confounded variables leads to another quasi-experimental group comparison that suggests another hypothesis, which is then tested in a further session of field-work. In each case, we emphasize how important it was to have extensive linguistic and ethnographic knowledge before implementing psychological tests. The research design is not cross-cultural as such (we hardly ever perform comparisons between societies), but culturally sensitive within a series of societies; in other words, as Dasen and Jahoda (1986, p. 413) defined it, “cross-cultural developmental psychology is not just comparative: essentially it is an outlook that takes culture seriously”. © The Author(s) 2018.

The first hypothesis was that there would be a difference in performance between male and female learning disabled children on the pattern of Subtest Scaled Scores of WISC-R, as categorized by Bannatyne. The second hypothesis was that Patterns of Subtest Scaled Scores of WISC-R for male and female learning disabled children of age 6 to 12 would change at age 13 and over.    Variables were studied in association to each other within the framework of ex-post-facto design. The criterion measure used in the investigation is intelligence, obtained through the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Revised), utilizing Bannatyne's recategorization (1974). Four sets of criteria were thus composed by aggregating WISC-R subscales into intelligence patterns: Spatial Ability, Verbal Conceptualizing Ability, Sequencing Ability, and Acquired Knowledge. The major input variables were sex, race, and age. An available group of 159 learning disabled children composed the sample. Frequency distributions, analysis of variance, multiple regression analysis were completed with the utilization of appropriate computer programs.    Major statistical results were as follows:  (1) There is a significant difference (P < .001) between racial groups on the Pattern of Subtests Scaled Scores taken simultaneously. (2) In categorizing subjects according to sex and age, the two-way analysis of variance show a significant difference between males and females in Verbal and Performance Scores. (3) The multivariate analysis points out that an overall significant difference exists between sexes. (4) Sex is the best predictor of Total Intelligence Scores (R = .237), followed by race and age.    The following conclusions were drawn from the data analysis:  (1) The first research hypothesis was basically sustained in terms of results provided by multivariate analysis of variance. However, when analyzed one by one, it is noted that the variable that significantly differs between sexes is Spatial Ability Alone. (2) The second hypothesis was not supported by the data.

Neuroreport	https://doi.org/10.1097/WNR.0000000000001229	The purpose of this study was to examine motor imagery ability in patients with peripheral nerve disorder using the hand mental rotation task. Five patients with  left total avulsion brachial plexus palsy (BPP) and 16 healthy age-matched adults  participated in this study. The mean±SD time from the injury was 103.6±49.7 months.  Participants performed a hand mental rotation task as the motor imagery task;  outcome measures included the reaction time from cognizing hand stimuli to the  judgment of hand laterality (right or left) and the error rate. Patients also  completed the Hand 20 questionnaire to assess the use of their affected limb.  Log-transformed reaction times of the affected limb in patients with BPP were  significantly higher than those of the unaffected limb and the left-sided limb of  the healthy participants. Log-transformed reaction times of the unaffected limb in  patients were significantly higher than those of the right-sided limb in healthy  participants. Log-transformed error rate did not differ between patients and healthy  participants. According to the results of the Hand 20 questionnaire, patients with  BPP hardly used their affected limb because of severe sensory-motor dysfunction.  Motor imagery ability of the affected and unaffected limbs in patients with complete  BPP may be decreased owing to long-term disuse. These findings suggest that  long-term disuse in those with severe peripheral nerve disorders could affect motor  imagery ability of both the affected and unaffected limbs.

Schizophrenia research	https://doi.org/10.1016/S0920-9964(03)00187-7	By studying neuropsychological performance in children genetically at-risk for schizophrenia, greater understanding may be obtained regarding the developmental  processes of schizophrenia and associated cognitive weaknesses. A variety of  cognitive deficits in genetically at-risk children have been reported. The present  study was designed to examine cognitive tasks that have traditionally differentiated  children genetically at-risk for schizophrenia (e.g. working memory) from normal  children, while also assessing abilities that have received scant attention in this  population. Aspects of emotional perception, verbal abilities, inhibition,  visuo-spatial skills, and working memory were assessed in children of schizophrenic  parents and normal children. Significant differences in performances were identified  in at-risk children on measures of verbal skills, working memory and inhibition.  Findings suggest that children genetically at-risk for developing schizophrenia  exhibit neurocognitive weaknesses generally consistent with those noted in the  literature. However, inhibition also appeared to be a cognitive process that  significantly differentiated the groups. The possibility of a developmental  expression of neurocognitive deficits is discussed.

We specifically tested whether the correlation between four early literacy skills (rhyming, letter knowledge, emergent writing, and orthographic knowledge) and simple sums (non-symbolic and story condition) reduced after taking into account preschool attention control, short-term memory, speed of processing, visual-spatial skills, vocabulary, and shared book reading. 228 Dutch native preschoolers (mean age 54.25; SD = 2.12 months) participated. The results revealed that 1) all literacy skills were related to sums (non-symbolic and story condition), 2) rhyming was the strongest predictor of non-symbolic sums, and letter knowledge of sums in story context, 3) visual-spatial skills explained part of the shared variance in the non-symbolic condition and visualspatial skills, vocabulary and short-term memory explained part of the shared variance in sums in story context. Implications for the preschool curriculum and early interventions are discussed. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This study used both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods to assess these issues in a subsistence-based economy, the Tsimane of Bolivia. We find that though Tsimane “free-range” parenting is hands-off compared to that found in Western societies, parents nonetheless restrict children’s travel. Freedom to explore farther from home is dependent on children’s development and necessity (e.g., travel requirements for work and subsistence-based tasks) and, with few exceptions, is similar for girls and boys. Parents base those decisions on their experience with the child and the potential risks in the environment, rather than on age-specific standards. Finally, many parents and their children report concerns about environmental risks, but it does not significantly decrease children’s mobility, which is similar for girls and boys. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Females are also reported to be more harm-avoidant, which may reduce spatial exploration. We evaluated these relationships among 6–18 year old Tsimané children, who live in a forager-horticulturalist society where both girls and boys have few constraints on spatial exploration compared to children in Western societies. Mobility was assessed through GPS tracking and interview, spatial ability through pointing accuracy, perspective-taking and mental rotation, and harm avoidance through interview. Few gender differences were found in mobility or spatial ability, although males pointed more accurately to challenging (high sinuosity) routes. Both girls and boys became more harm avoidant about travel risks as they got older, but there were few gender differences in harm avoidance. Schooling was associated with better performance on mental rotation but worse performance on regional pointing accuracy, probably because schooling limits outdoor spatial exploration. © 2019 The Authors	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Human nature (Hawthorne, N.Y.)	https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-021-09388-7	A fundamental cognitive function found across a wide range of species and necessary for survival is the ability to navigate complex environments. It has been suggested  that mobility may play an important role in the development of spatial skills.  Despite evolutionary arguments offering logical explanations for why sex/gender  differences in spatial abilities and mobility might exist, thus far there has been  limited sampling from nonindustrialized and subsistence-based societies. This lack  of sampling diversity has left many unanswered questions regarding the effects that  environmental variation and cultural norms may have in shaping mobility patterns  during childhood and the development of spatial competencies that may be associated  with it. Here we examine variation in mobility (through GPS tracking and  interviews), performance on large-scale spatial skills (i.e., navigational ability),  and performance on small-scale spatial skills (e.g., mental rotation task, Corsi  blocks task, and water-level task) among Twa forager/pastoralist children whose  daily lives have been dramatically altered since settlement and the introduction of  government-funded boarding schools. Unlike in previous findings among Twa adults,  boys and girls (N = 88; aged 6-18) show similar patterns of travel on all measures  of mobility. We also find no significant differences in spatial task performance by  gender for large- or small-scale spatial skills. Further, children performed as well  as adults did on mental rotation, and they outperformed adults on the water-level  task. We discuss how children's early learning environments may influence the  development of both large- and small-scale spatial skills.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Hence it is reasonable to expect that DS may result in a reduced ability to engage in these skills. Two experiments are reported that evaluated route-learning of youth with DS, youth with intellectual disability (ID) and not DS, and typically developing (TD) children matched on mental age (MA). In both experiments, participants learned routes with eight choice point presented via computer. Several objects were placed along the route that could be used as landmarks. Participants navigated the route once with turn indicators pointing the way and then retraced the route without them. In Experiment 1 we found that the TD children and ID participants performed very similarly. They learned the route in the same number of attempts, committed the same number of errors while learning the route, and recalled approximately the same number of landmarks. The participants with DS performed significantly worse on both measures of navigation (attempts and errors) and also recalled significantly fewer landmarks. In Experiment 2, we attempted to reduce TD and ID vs DS differences by focusing participants' attention on the landmarks. Half of the participants in each group were instructed to identify the landmarks as they passed them the first time. The participants with DS again committed more errors than the participants in the ID and TD groups in the navigation task. In addition, they recalled fewer landmarks. While landmark identification improved landmark memory for both groups, it did not have a significant impact on navigation. Participants with DS still performed more poorly than did the TD and ID participants. Of additional interest, we observed that the performance of persons with DS correlated with different ability measures than did the performance of the other groups. The results the two experiments point to a problem in navigation for persons with DS that exceeds expectations based solely on intellectual level. © 2014 Davis, Merrill, Conners and Roskos.

Autism spectrum disorder is accepted by the mental health and medical fields as being particularly heterogeneous. Differences in diagnosis between clinicians has contributed to the heightened rate of misdiagnosis and repeated failure to formulate a definite profile for HF-ASD because varying interpretations and diagnoses by clinicians impede the reliability and validity of research efforts. This study aims to add to the body of research on core characteristics of HF-ASD in grade and secondary school-age children by assessing the visual- spatial, visual and auditory memory, and social skills profiles of individuals with HF-ASD in hopes of aiding un the creation of a standardized set of measurements that indicate the presence of HF-ASD. By measuring specific functional characteristics in individuals being assessed for HF-ASD, clinicians can be offered a quantitative and standardized form of measurement that may indicate the presence of this disorder. Researchers found that students in the testing sample showed significant deficits in visual-spatial skills as well as social skills (when evaluated by a parent or teacher) as compared to typical same-age peers.

International Journal of Behavioral Development	https://doi.org/10.1080/016502501316934842	The present study assessed the longstanding question of whether there is a relationship between sex hormones and cognitive ability in young adolescent girls and boys. Three "theories" of the relationship between hormone levels and cognition were identified from a broad literature base and were used to formulate hypotheses regarding the relationship between sex hormones and cognitive ability in early adolescents. Fifty-six boys, aged 10-14, and 52 girls, aged 9-14, completed two standardised spatial ability tests and one standardised test of verbal ability. Three blood samples, at 20-minute intervals, were obtained to determine levels of estradiol and testosterone. Data were collected on three occasions for all measures at 6-month intervals. A positive linear relationship between testosterone and spatial ability was identified for boys at each time of measurement for both measures of spatial ability (i.e., mental rotation and block design). For girls, a positive linear relationship was identified between testosterone and mental rotation only at time 3. In addition, longitudinal relationships were identified between change in testosterone levels and change in spatial ability for both girls and boys. The conclusion was that testosterone is related to cognitive functioning during pubertal development for boys and to a lesser extent for girls.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Menopause (New York, N.Y.)	https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0b013e318287474f	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effects of continuous-combined estradiol 1 mg/drospirenone 2 mg (E2D) on cognitive performance in healthy, recently  postmenopausal women. METHODS: A 6-month randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled study was carried out in a university research center.  Participants were 23 healthy postmenopausal women aged 49 to 55 years. Cognitive  performance was assessed with a computerized cognitive battery administered to all  participants on 0, 12, and 26 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was  performed on 13 participants before and after treatment using tasks of verbal  fluency and mental rotation. RESULTS: E2D was not associated with an overall effect  on cognitive performance. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results showed no  difference between the groups for verbal fluency or mental rotation task performance  at baseline. The mental rotation task was associated with increased blood oxygen  level-dependent signalling in the placebo group in both occipital lobes and in the  left superior parietal lobe after 26 weeks (P < 0.05), with no changes over time  seen in the treatment group. The total menopausal symptom and sexual function domain  scores improved after treatment in women randomized to E2D compared with the placebo  group (both P < 0.05). Similarly, systolic blood pressure, weight, and body mass  index were significantly lower in women randomized to E2D at 26 weeks (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSIONS: E2D has no detrimental effect on cognitive performance in early  postmenopausal women. E2D significantly improves menopausal symptoms, sexual  function, systolic blood pressure, and weight.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Individuals with autism also exhibit atypical event-related brain potentials to faces, characterized by a failure to show a negative component (N170) latency advantage to face compared to nonface stimuli and a bilateral, rather than right lateralized, pattern of N170 distribution. In this report, performance by 143 parents of children with autism on standardized verbal, visual-spatial, and face recognition tasks was examined. It was found that parents of children with autism exhibited a significant decrement in face recognition ability relative to their verbal and visual spatial abilities. Event-related brain potentials to face and nonface stimuli were examined in 21 parents of children with autism and 21 control adults. Parents of children with autism showed an atypical event-related potential response to faces, which mirrored the pattern shown by children and adults with autism. These results raise the possibility that face processing might be a functional trait marker of genetic susceptibility to autism. Discussion focuses on hypotheses regarding the neurodevelopmental and genetic basis of altered face processing in autism. A general model of the normal emergence of social brain circuitry in the first year of life is proposed, followed by a discussion of how the trajectory of normal development of social brain circuitry, including cortical specialization for face processing, is altered in individuals with autism. The hypothesis that genetic-mediated dysfunction of the dopamine reward system, especially its functioning in social contexts, might account for altered face processing in individuals with autism and their relatives is discussed.

Eighty-four preschool children (M = 4 years 11 months, range = 4 years 0 months to 5 years 6 months) were given pretests, training, and posttests on block design and similarities tasks. Two measurement models and four structural models were tested to determine (a) if pretest, learning and posttest performances were domain specific, and (b) if paths from both pretests and learning assessments were needed to predict posttest performance. The measurement model that fit the data maintained separate verbal and spatial domains. The structural model that best fit the data included paths from both pretest and learning assessments to posttest performances within each domain. Thus, L. S. Vygotsky's (1978) claim that pretest and learning assessments together are better indicators of an individual's ability than either measure alone was supported.

The biological features of sleep start to undergo intense changes during childhood and adolescence. These biological features may conflict with schedules and environmental changes, and lead to sleep-phase delays that may influence the performance of cognitive processes essential for learning during school years, visuo-spatial perception, working memory, and attention, for example. This study examines the literature discussing the relation between sleep and cognitive processes in children and pre-adolescents. The papers indicate an association between sleep and cognitive performance, sleep changes compromising intelligence, as well as visuo-spatial skills and other cognitive processes; but, there might be other factors involved, such as socioeconomic status. This review discusses the findings, drawing attention to areas of disagreement as well as agreement. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

The purpose of the present study was to determine if these abnormalities can also be observed in adults with ADHD. There were 32 control subjects, 25 subjects with ADHD of the primarily hyperactive type (ADHDhy), and 17 subjects with ADHD of the primarily inattentive type (ADHDpi). For the purposes of analysis, the ADHDhy and ADHDpi groups were combined to form a CLINICAL group. The subjects were right handed males and females between the ages of 20 and 50 years of age. During the study, EEG activity was recorded from 19 electrode sites while subjects sat with their eyes open and eyes closed, and while they performed a variety of tasks including: the Tests of Variability of Attention (TOVA), a reading task, a mental rotation task, a selective attention task, and a listening task. The results of the discriminant function analyses produced functions that correctly classified an average of 60 out of 74 of the control and ADHD subjects during the TOVA, listening, and selective attention tasks (p < .0005). An ANOVA of inter-hemispheric activity revealed that only the ADHDpi group were significantly different from the control group with more right than left hemispheric activity in the delta band during the mental rotation task (p < .006). A paired t-test analysis of inter-hemispheric activity showed that both the ADHDhy and ADHDpi groups had different percentage levels of right and left hemispheric activity (p < .005) during the performance of the eyes closed, T.O.V.A., mental rotation, and reading tasks; there were no significant differences in the control group in any of these comparisons. A MANOVA of regional (frontal, central, posterior, left temporal, and right temporal) activity revealed statistically significant differences in the theta/beta ratio during the eyes closed condition for the ADHDhy group with a higher ratio in the frontal region and right temporal area (p < .006). The results suggest that the differences between normal and ADHD children continues into adulthood but that the magnitude of the differences is reduced. A dysfunction in EEG activity caused by a maturational lag is supported by the results of this study. Based on the results of the analyses, recommendations are made as to which frequency bands and electrode sites should be targeted for use in neurotherapy.

There is a slight swing back to ventriculo peritoneal drainage from the universally used ventriculo cardiac shunt. Shunting with shrinking of the brain from previous hydrocephalus results in thickening and infolding of the cerebral cortex and a filling of the folds with dense blood vessels and gelatinous attachments to the dura; there is also a thickening of the arachnoid and distortion of the brain with the tentorium and cerebellum rising upwards. Skull size depends on the patient's age when the shunt was inserted. It may thicken as well as contract; the ventricles shrink and may become asymmetrical from unilateral drainage. Spontaneous arrest of hydrocephalus does occur but no correlation could be found between location or other factors in predicting its occurrence. The I.Q. is slightly lower in shunted hydrocephalus than normal brains and still lower in those with other CNS malformations. The thickness of the brain mantle is less important than the total brain mass in determining the anticipated I.Q. The rate of development of the hydrocephalus affects functional damage; the more rapid the onset the more the damage; the duration of hydrocephalus also determines ultimate brain damage and consequently the I.Q. Psychologic testing shows specific losses in learning to write, manual dexterity and spatial ability, as well as visual perception and motor deficits. There are also specific losses in recognizing shapes or rejecting irrelevant information, all of which necessitates a longer learning period than in normal children. But prognosis in I.Q. and performance still cannot be made by analysis of any known criteria. (Scoville - Hartford, Conn.)	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	2	2	0	0	1

This form of describing both macro- and micro-location involves fixed points of reference, based on the landscape or cardinal directional terms. An example glossed into English would be 'The axe is west of the tree'. The use of geocentric location in a Mayan language has been documented by Brown and Levinson (1993), and cognitive implications of languages with these systems have been suggested by Levinson (1992). The present paper describes a system of geocentric location in Tzotzil (Mayan). It explores the development of such a system, previously unreported in studies of the acquisition of spatial language. The use of the system among adults and children is presented on the basis of cross-sectional tasks, linguistic and ethnographic observations, and preliminary longitudinal work. Our findings suggest that children acquire the system around age 4;6;2 it appears to develop in stages of successively more integrated frames of reference: (a) egocentric, (b) locally anchored, and (c) abstractly coordinated. The acquisition of the geocentric system by Tzotzil-speaking children in the hamlet of Nabenchauk, Zinacantan, Mexico seems to follow Piagetian predictions that projective location is acquired after topological notions of space. However, our Tzotzil data show that Tzotzil children begin to master the geocentric system between ages 4 and 5, an age at which European children cannot systematically label their own right and left (Piaget and Inhelder 1956). This finding suggests that the presence of a geocentric system in grammar may orient language learners to more rapid acquisition of a spatial skill than might be predicted by Piagetian research. © Walter de Gruyter	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The effect of different social rules	European Journal of Psychology of Education	https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03172729	The present study is concerned with assessing whether social marking (i.e. the correspondence between the correct solution of a task and some known social rule) is a mechanism of cognitive progress which depends on specific forms of rule represented in the task material. Results of an experiment on a spatial transformation task (N=sixty-four non-conserving 5-6-year-olds) showed no significantly different levels of cognitive progress for subjects who transformed the spatial arrangement of a classroom or of a theatre. Significant difference emerged only when a deviation from the normally regulated arrangement were represented. In the condition where the deviation concerned the theatre subjects showed the lower level of progress. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of social marking may depend on the form of rule represented. Results were discussed with respect to children's knowledge of the relative alterability of different types of rules. © 1987 Instituto Superior de Psicologia Aplicada, Lisbon, Portugal/ Springer Netherlands.

More specifically, this study examined whether differences in various areas of cognitive functioning existed between the two groups and if so, were the differences reflected in discrepancies in the proportion of children who exhibited weaknesses in certain domains. Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Differential Ability Scales-Second Edition (DAS-II; Elliott, 2007). Eighty-six (ADHD n = 47 and Mathematics Disorder n = 39) primarily English-speaking school-age children of at least Low Average intelligence were evaluated by trained and supervised graduate students. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted for each of the relevant DAS-II cluster and subtest scores. Children with ADHD earned significantly higher scores than children with Mathematics Disorder on measures of nonverbal reasoning ability, spatial ability, working memory, processing speed, and long-term storage and retrieval. In addition, the proportion of children with Mathematics Disorder who had weaknesses in certain cognitive domains was significantly higher than the proportion of children with ADHD who had weaknesses in these areas. Implications of these findings, including the possibility that having Mathematics Disorder affects a myriad of the broad cognitive abilities, in addition to mathematics achievement, are discussed.

Design: A randomized controlled trial consisted of 6 study groups who received identical laparoscopic suturing training but at differing frequencies of sessions. Setting: The faculty of medicine of the KULEUVEN is the largest medical faculty in Belgium. Participants: Medical students without experience in laparoscopy (n = 145). Methods: After baseline assessments, the students were randomized into 6 groups to receive 6 training sessions of 1.5 hours each. Training Groups were as follows: 3 sessions daily (TD), bidaily sessions, 1 session daily (OD), 1 session on alternative days, 1 session weekly, and 1 session weekly with an optional deliberate practice in between sessions (WD). All exercises and feedback given were identical. One and 6 months after the final session, an evaluation was performed where a 5-cm chicken-skin incision had to be closed with 3 laparoscopic knots. The cumulative time to approximate the skin edges adequately was used for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Results: There were no significant differences amongst the groups at baseline concerning ambidexterity, motivation, or spatial abilities. The group OD outperformed the massed groups (TD and bidaily sessions) and the weekly groups (1 session weekly and WD) significantly (p = 0.003). After 1 month there was still a significant advantage for regular training groups (OD, 1 session on alternative days, and WD) over massed training groups (TD) (p = 0.004). After 6 months only a statistical difference (p = 0.04) between group OD and group TD was observed. Group WD's score remained stable after 6 months. Conclusions: Short-term, once daily 1.5-hours session seems most beneficial for learning intracorporeal endoscopic suturing. After 6 months, distributed shorter training still remains better than massed practice but weekly training and daily training are comparable. Optional Deliberate Practice between the official training sessions reduces skill decay. © 2013 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A procedure was devised in which children were requ red to draw states of movement to an end-state which gradually and imperceptibly changed from the geometrically correct to an incorrect position during the course of the drawing. The quality of children's anticipation of the rotation movement was assessed on the basis of whether children drew the geometrically correct end-state, ended their drawings at the incorrect slide end-state, or drew a different and arbitrary end-state. Thequality of children's hindsight was assessed on the basis of the frequencies and timing of corrections to previously drawn states occasioned by the changing end-state. Relations between children's patterns of performance on the imaging measure and their level of performance on Euclidean geometric operations tasks generally confirmed predictions based on Piaget et al.'s (1960) theory of relations between children's spatial anticipatory imagery and their knowledge of the structure of Euclidean space. © 1979, Sage Publications.

The hypothesis was tested by comparing children's performances on a drawing version and a reaction-time (RT) version of J. Piaget and B. Inhelder's (Mental imagery in the child, New York, Basic Books, 1971) rotating squares task. On the RT task, children were differentiated into three groups according to their patterns of preparation and decision times and their decision errors. One group (A) included mental rotaters, operationally defined according to three criteria borrowed from L. Cooper and R. Shepard (In W. G. Chase, Ed., Visual Information Processing, New York, Academic Press, 1973). A second group (B) included children who failed to meet the criteria for mental rotation, but evidenced an ability to imagine some changes in the square's position. These children responded more quickly and accurately on vertical-horizontal (V-H) angle trials (90° and 180°) than oblique angle trials (45° and 135°). A third group (C) included children who provided no evidence of any systematic imaging strategy. On the drawing task group A children drew both oblique and V-H states correctly, group B children could draw V-H but not oblique states, and group C children could draw neither. These results were interpreted as evidence that the problems that children have in drawing are common to the problems they have in preparing a mental image. The results were discussed in terms of claims that drawing errors result solely from drawing conventions (S. Kosslyn, Image and Mind, Cambridge, Mass., Harvard Univ. Press, 1980) or from poor motor coordination (G. S. Marmor, Cognitive Psychology, 1975, 7, 548-599). © 1982.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The movement recognition task assessed children's understanding that pivot position and the shape of a rotating object remain invariant throughout the movement. Based on an analysis of development in children's counting, we hypothesized that explicit knowledge of sequence relations is not needed on the state-comparison task but is needed on the pivot and shape recognition task. In Experiment 1, 5- and 7-year-old children performed on the state-comparison task and an ordering task involving a Mickey Mouse figure. In Experiment 2, children between the ages of 5 and 13 years performed on a pivot and shape recognition task and an ordering task involving rotating squares. As predicted, the results indicated that 5-year-olds can execute a mental rotation on the state-comparison task but cannot sequence states in the rotation movement, whereas sequencing was a prerequisite for identification of incorrect movement sequences on the recognition task. The implications of these findings for development in children's kinetic imagery were discussed. © 1986.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Results indicate that although Ss did not differ in their patterns for peripheral activities across factors, LD Ss were significantly more bilateral on factors involving visually guided fine motor activity, listening, and fine motor foot preference. Further analysis showed that one significant discriminant function correctly predicted the group placement of some 71% of the Ss. Findings are interpreted as supporting a hypothesis of less coherent lateralized cerebral systems for many LD children. Study 2 examined the verbal--spatial abilities of 78 LD 5th graders classified as normal or mixed in their preference patterns using the discriminant function derived in Study 1. Results indicate that whereas Ss of mixed dominance for peripheral activities were deficient in spatial abilities, they were verbally more adept than normally lateralized LD Ss.

Psychological science	https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797609354073	We examined the role of working memory in observed reactive parenting in a sample of 216 mothers and their same-sex twin children. The mothers and their children were  observed completing two frustrating cooperation tasks during a visit to the home.  The mothers worked one-on-one with each child separately. Mothers completed the  Vocabulary (verbal), Block Design (spatial), and Digit Span (working memory)  subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition. We used a  within-family quasi-experimental design to estimate the magnitude of the association  between sibling differences in observed challenging behaviors (i.e., opposition and  distractibility) and the difference in the mother's negativity toward each child. As  hypothesized, reactive negativity was evident only among mothers with poorer working  memory. Verbal and spatial ability did not show this moderating effect. The effect  was replicated in a post hoc secondary data analysis of a sample of adoptive mothers  and sibling children. Results implicate working memory in the etiology of harsh  reactive parenting.

M.	2019	journalArticle	The association between mental rotation capacity and motor impairment in children with obesity-an exploratory study.	PeerJ	https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8150	BACKGROUND: Motor impairments are relatively common in children with obesity and evidence suggests that these difficulties go beyond those expected based on the  extra weight. This study aimed to investigate the mental rotation capacity in  children with obesity, i.e., the ability to mentally view and rotate spatial  information, which is a function of both visual-spatial and action representation  processes. In particular, we examined whether children with obesity solved mental  hand rotation tasks using an egocentric perspective (i.e., motor imagery) and if  performance was related to their motor competence. METHODS: Fifty children (age  range: 7-11 y) of which 19 with obesity and motor impairments (OB-) as assessed by  the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (2nd version), 13 with obesity without  motor impairments (OB+) and 18 control children with a healthy weight (HW) and  normal motor competence, were submitted to a classic hand rotation task. Sitting at  a desk the children were instructed to indicate the laterality of a picture of a  hand displayed on a monitor as quickly and as accurately as possible. RESULTS: The  results indicate no differences in response time between groups (2,648 ms, 2,558 ms,  2,664 ms for OB-, OB+ and HW respectively). The OB- group, however, had  significantly lower accuracy rates and inverse efficiency scores than the HW group  (Accuracy: 72% vs. 89%; Inverse efficiency: 4,428 vs. 3,238). No difference was  observed in accuracy and inverse efficiency between the OB+ and HW group (Accuracy:  86%; Inverse efficiency: 3,432). In all groups, slower and more error-prone  responses were observed when the angle of rotation was larger and when the hand on  display was incongruent with the posture of the participants, which indicates that  judgments were made from an egocentric perspective and involved motor imagery.  CONCLUSION: All children, including those with obesity, appear to engage in motor  imagery. This notion needs to be investigated further in children with obesity and  motor impairments, given their generally lower accuracy and decreased efficiency,  which may indicate a reduced mental rotation capacity.

Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1080/13803390802484805	This study investigated the notion that children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) show a reduced capacity of internally simulating movements of their  own body or motor imagery. Using a mental rotation paradigm the contribution of hand  posture to laterality/mirror judgments of bodily and alphanumeric stimuli was  studied in 13 children with DCD and 13 matched typically developing (TD) children.  Children were asked to judge whether the stimulus on display, rotated over -90  degrees , -30 degrees , +30 degrees , or +90 degrees , was a right or left hand or a  canonical or mirror-reversed letter. Analysis of accuracy (ACC) and response times  (RTs) demonstrated that children with DCD were generally slower and made more  errors. RTs to letter stimuli were faster than those to hand stimuli in both DCD and  TD children. For both groups RTs profiles were influenced by the orientation of the  stimulus, showing longer response times for larger rotations. Clockwise rotations of  right hands resulted in slower judgments than did counterclockwise rotations,  whereas the reverse was true for left hands. Moreover, the results also indicate a  contribution of hand posture to the laterality judgments of hands, with longer RTs  when the posture of the participants' hands was opposite to the posture of the hands  on display. Importantly, these effects that suggest an imagery strategy engaging  motor processes were present in both groups. Apparently, the children with DCD of  the present study did rely on motor imagery to solve the mental rotation task;  however, their judgments seem to be compromised by a less well-defined internal  model.

The Impact of Educational Toys on Spatial Development in Preschoolers		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/what-makes-toy-educational-impact-toys-on-spatial/docview/1687752385/se-2?accountid=11531	This study examines the arbitrary "educational" label assigned to educational toys, and investigates the validity of these toys' marketing claims in a pilot study with two thrusts: 1) a play intervention with preschoolers, in which a group of five 4-year-old preschoolers played with a sample of eight educational toys for six twenty-minute play sessions; and 2) individual interviews with five parents and five educators of preschoolers designed to extract their opinions of educational toys and their marketing claims. The educational toys selected for the sample of toys used in the play intervention were all marketed as improving spatial skills in some way. Children were allowed to play freely with the toys during each session. In order to determine whether or not playing with the selected toys impacted spatial skills, the Test of Spatial Ability (TOSA) was administered to obtain a pre- and post-test measure of participants' spatial ability. Parents of the child participants and educators participated in individual, twenty-minute interviews, in which they were asked their opinions of the efficacy of educational toys in meeting the learning outcomes they advertise; whether or not they provide such toys for children; and what they believed made toys "educational" in general. Only two of the five children participants demonstrated improvements in their performance on the TOSA. Parents and educators presented mixed opinions of the efficacy of educational toys; only two educators and three parents stated that they bought educational toys for children, and all participants expressed that they believed any toy could be educational, contingent on 1) the toy's appeal for the child and the child's subsequent enjoyment from playing with the toy; 2) the way the toy is used by the child; and 3) scaffolding during play from teachers, adults, and peers. This study underscores the need for more research investigating the efficacy of educational toys, the role they play in the way that parents and educators provide learning experiences for children, and how such toys are legitimately marketed.

This article summarizes the results of different types of statistical analyses. Within this framework, more detailed quantitative research can be interpreted. The subtests appear to be highly reliable, and achievement in school can be predicted with some accuracy. Factor analysis indicates four interpretable factors in both vision groups. The vision groups - for which separate age-norms were established - differed mainly on tests measuring spatial ability.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Executive functions (EFs) such as working memory, inhibition and planning are fundamental for succeeding in this complex activity and are often impaired in Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Our aim was to analyze the feasibility of a new ecological navigation task, the Virtual City paradigm™ (VC™) to test visuo-spatial memory and EFs in children with ADHD. Visuo-spatial short and working memory, inhibition and planning skills were tested with standardized tasks. The VC™, a new paradigm developed by our group, used the Virtual CarpetTM technology, consisting of a virtual town with houses, streets and crossroads projected on the ground. It includes a motion capture system, tracking body movement in 3D in real time. In one condition, children were required to walk through the city and reach a sequence of houses. In the other, before walking, they had to plan the shortest path to reach the houses, inhibiting the prepotent response to start walking. The results show a good feasibility of the paradigm (feasibility checklist and ad hoc questionnaire), being ecological and motivating. VC™ measures of span positively correlated with visuo-spatial short and working memory measures, suggesting that VC™ heavily relies on efficient spatial memory. Individual subject analyses suggested that children with ADHD may approach this task differently from typically developing children. Larger samples of ADHD and healthy children may further explore the specific role of EFs and memory, potentially opening new avenues for intervention. © Copyright © 2021 Del Lucchese, Belmonti, Brovedani, Caponi, Castilla, Masi, Tacchi, Zaoui, Cioni and Berthoz.

The present study has two aims: evaluate the incidence of calculation disabilities between more general learning disabilities and describe their relationship with memory and spatial abilities in groups different for IQ and sex. Calculation and learning disabilities' incidence is similar to the percentages referred by other epidemiological studies. Boys show more Calculation Disabilities: between normal IQ children, the prevailing group is that with calculation disability alone, the lower calculation performance group is that with calculation and other learning disabilities. At last we considered some differences between boys and girls in memory and graphic-spatial abilities, looking at their learning disability and its relationship with hemispheric organization.

Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70771-8	Shortly before the acquisition of right and left, which generally occurs around age 6-7 years, a very simple right/left discrimination task makes it possible to  distinguish groups of children with strikingly different cognitive abilities.  Preschool children aged from 5 to 6.4 years were asked to show their left hand,  right eye, left ear and right hand. On a variety of simple cognitive tasks exploring  verbal fluency, syntactic comprehension, working memory, visuo-spatial ability and  number processing, children who made from 1 to 3 errors (14% of the sample)  performed significantly worse than those who showed systematic reversal (30%) and  those who made no error. Differential use of logical thinking can partially explain  these differences. Neuropsychological implications of these developmental findings  are discussed.

A computerised version of the peg-moving task  was used repeatedly to assess hand skill of the dominant and the nondominant hand.  Cognitive performance was repeatedly evaluated by tasks involving speech,  vocabulary, phonological memory, and visual-spatial skills. Results showed that: (i)  age, sex, and handedness effects on hand skill asymmetry generally confirmed  previous reports, especially by Annett (2002); (ii) visual-spatial and vocabulary  tasks were significantly related to hand skill but speech and phonological memory  tasks were not, and the role of the dominant and nondominant hand were similar;  (iii) overall, manual laterality indexes were only weakly associated to some  cognitive abilities; (iv) early manual skill was more strongly associated to  cognitive tasks than later manual skill. These results fit the assumption of a  significant role of early manual behaviour in aspects of cognitive development not  relying exclusively on phonology, and raise questions about cognitive development  and rehabilitation of children with early occurring manual deficiencies.

Background: Early-life unilateral lesions of the basal ganglia are rare and the resulting syndrome not described. Methods: Both children had repeated clinical assessments, MRI and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans, and psychometric and achievement testing over 10 years. Results: Right basal ganglia destruction was similar and virtually coextensive in both children; optic nerve and oculomotor dysfunction were disparate. One had a right temporal pole porencephalic cyst with anomalous overlying cortex. The clinical syndrome included left hemiparesis with distal spasticity and without hypotrophy; extraocular movement disorders; severe episodic disinhibition, impulsiveness, hitting reflexively, and extreme emotional lability. Outbursts of screaming and cursing resembled "sham rage." Both had mild intellectual retardation with competent language but poor nonverbal and visual-spatial abilities, visual memory, and daily living and socialization skills. Conclusions: The shared behavioral and cognitive syndrome is most reasonably attributed to the right basal ganglia lesions, which were complete and coextensive in both, whereas other lesions were partial, milder, and disparate. Early destruction of the right basal ganglia may preclude normal development of right hemisphere functions without evidence of plasticity and appears associated with intense disinhibition and impulsiveness of aggressive attack activities and with general lability and dyscontrol of emotion.

Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS	https://doi.org/10.1017/s135561771020094	Children with spina bifida and hydrocephalus (SBH) have long been known to have difficulties with visual perception. We studied how children with SBH perform 12  visual perception tasks requiring object identification, multistable representations  of visual space, or visually guided overt actions. Four tasks required object-based  processing (visual constancy illusions, face recognition, recognition of fragmented  objects, line orientation). Four tasks required the representation of visual space  in egocentric coordinates (stereopsis, visual figure-ground identification,  perception of multistable figures, egocentric mental rotation). Four tasks required  the coupling of visual space to overt movement (visual pursuit, figure drawing,  visually guided route finding, visually guided route planning). Effect sizes,  measuring the magnitude of the difference between SBH children and controls, were  consistently larger for action-based than object-based visual perception tasks.  Within action-based tasks, effect sizes were large and roughly comparable for tasks  requiring the representation of visual space and for tasks requiring visually guided  action. The results are discussed in terms of the physical and brain problems of  children with SBH that limit their ability to build effective situation models of  space.

Hypotheses addressed the nature and extent of longitudinal sex differences in cognitive abilities among racial groups varying in physical maturation. Controlling for selected socioeconomic influences, a slight sex by race interaction was found at four and seven years. Generally, white females scored somewhat lower on cognitive tests than white males, whereas black females scored equivalently or somewhat higher than black males. Test score differences among the four sex and race groups were more apparent in seven-year spatial abilities relative to verbal abilities.

The present study examined biological, environmental, and psychological variables collected from birth through age 17 on a sample of subjects who participated in the Philadelphia Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP). Findings supported in part past research suggesting that environmental relationships with intellectual ability and delinquency are strongest for males, whereas biological relationships are somewhat more important for females. Socioeconomic factors were among the strongest predictors of delinquency for both sexes, however. In turn, biological and environmental influences on verbal and spatial abilities and their relationships with later achievement were different between the sexes. Results are discussed in terms of possible sex differences in the development of the left and right cerebral hemispheres, as well as in the vulnerability to environmental influences. © 1984 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

Under each of these conditions they were required to find identical figures in an array of stimuli of either the first or the second type. The response chosen determined the next stimulus used, the figures in both being identical. Four chains of 10 responses were thus obtained. Comparison of the choices reveals that the set consisting of ‘plain’ responses to ‘cube’ stimuli diverges significantly from the other three sets. This result is discussed in the context of other studies of implicit‐shape constancy. 1979 The British Psychological Society	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Twin research and human genetics : the official journal of the International Society for Twin Studies	https://doi.org/10.1375/183242706777591290	In the classic twin design, estimation of genetic and environmental effects is based on the assumption that environmental influences are shared to the same extent by  monozygotic and dizygotic twins (equal environment assumption, EEA). We explore the  conditions in which the EEA can be tested based on multivariate phenotypic data. We  focus on the test whether the correlation between shared environmental factors in  dizygotic twins (r(C)) is less than 1. First, model identification was investigated  analytically in Maple and Mx. Second, statistical power was examined in Mx. Third,  the amount of bias caused by violation of the EEA was evaluated. Finally,  applications to empirical data concern spatial ability in adolescents and aggression  in children. Bivariate and trivariate models include several instances in which the  EEA can be tested. The number of twin pairs that is needed to detect violation of  the EEA with a statistical power of .80 (alpha = .05) varied between 508 and 3576  pairs for the situations considered. The bias in parameter estimates, given  misspecification, ranged from 5% to 34% for additive genetic effects, and from 4% to  34% for shared environmental effects. Estimates of the nonshared environmental  effects were not biased. The EEA was not violated for spatial ability or aggression.  Multivariate data provide sufficient information to test the validity of the EEA.  The number of twin pairs that is needed is no greater than the number typically  available in most twin registries. The analysis of spatial ability and aggression  indicated no detectable violation of the EEA.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	3	3	0	0	1

Study design: From a prospective population-based cohort study of newborns with CHDs (EPICARD), we included 473 children with available neurodevelopmental assessments at 8 years of age. We grouped the CHD based on symptoms at birth and need for early neonatal intervention. Ventricular septal defects that closed spontaneously within the first year of life were considered the control group. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed using the Kauffman Assessment Battery Test for Children, Second Edition, for IQ (mean 100 ± 15), and the Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment Battery, Second Edition, for detailed assessment of specific neurocognitive domains (mean 10 ± 3). Multivariable regression analysis was used to compare the outcomes across the CHD groups after considering potentially confounding variables. Results: Compared with the control group, children with cyanotic CHD without heart failure had lower scores for IQ, −7.2 (95% CI –13.4 to −1.2). Children with noncyanotic CHD with heart failure had lower scores in the specific domains of language −1.5 (95% CI –2.2 to −0.7), and memory and learning −1.3 (95% CI –2.4; −0.3). Those with both cyanotic CHD and heart failure had lower scores for IQ, −7.6 (95% CI –13.5 to −1.8), as well as the specific domains of language and memory and learning, −2.0 (95% CI –2.9 to −1.0) and −1.1 (95% CI –2.3 to −0.1), respectively. Conclusions: Children with symptomatic CHD at birth are at greater risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes at 8 years of age, with the greatest risk for those who were born with both cyanosis and heart failure. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

At the same time, NF1 is frequently associated with intellectual disabilities across several neuropsychological domains. Existing neuropsychological data in NF1 adults are limited and sometimes contradictory. Moreover, most studies use a non-IQ-controlled norm group for comparison. This study sought to investigate specific neuropsychological characteristics in intellectual abilities unrelated to the global intellectual capacity. Method: Twenty NF1 adults and an IQ-, age- and gender-matched control group completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery composed of specific cognitive tests investigating visual-spatial abilities and memory, auditory memory, selective and sustained attention and executive functioning. A short version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - III was also administered to both groups. Results: Norm comparison showed that both groups perform poorly on most neuropsychological functions, except for sustained attention. However, comparison with the IQ-matched control group showed significantly lower scores on visual-spatial abilities and memory, on auditory working memory and on tests for cognitive flexibility in NF1 adults. Nevertheless, as the significant difference in average estimated IQ score between the NF1 group and the selected control group almost reaches the 5% significance level, further analysis is needed to include IQ as a covariate. Eventually, problems in visual-spatial skills and auditory long-term memory seem to be specific NF1-related deficits, while problems in attention and executive functioning are particularly related to their general lowered intellectual abilities. Conclusion: Taking into account that primary visual perception problems could be part of a more general central coherence deficit while interpreting auditory memory problems as possibly related to deficits in language use and comprehension, this idea also fits with the observation of several problems in social information processing and functioning of NF1 persons. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, MENCAP & IASSID.

Using a case study approach, we examined the relationship between reading achievement and general cognitive ability, phonological skills, and visual-spatial skills for the two individuals. We found that, despite the strong similarity between the two individuals in terms of their verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities and their phonological abilities (as well as chronological age and educational opportunities), their reading and spelling abilities differed by more than 5 grade levels. We present evidence that the difference in written language performance was likely to be due to differences in the severity and nature of their visual-spatial impairment. Moreover, we show that specific difficulty processing the orientation of visual stimuli is related to the reading difficulties of one of the two individuals. These results underscore the contribution of visual-spatial abilities to the reading acquisition process and identify WS as a potential source of valuable information regarding the role of visual-spatial processing in reading development. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.104.3.763-772	The neurobiological hypothesis supports the relevance of studying visual-perceptual and visual-motor skills in relation to cognitive abilities in intellectual  disabilities because the defective intellectual functioning in intellectual  disabilities is not restricted to higher cognitive functions but also to more basic  functions. The sample was 102 children 6 to 16 years old and with different  severities of intellectual disabilities. Children were administered the Wechsler  Intelligence Scale for Children, the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test, and the  Developmental Test of Visual Perception, and data were also analysed according to  the presence or absence of organic anomalies, which are etiologically relevant for  mental disabilities. Children with intellectual disabilities had deficits in  perceptual organisation which correlated with the severity of intellectual  disabilities. Higher correlations between the spatial subtests of the Developmental  Test of Visual Perception and the Performance subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence  Scale for Children suggested that the spatial skills and cognitive performance may  have a similar basis in information processing. Need to differentiate protocols for  rehabilitation and intervention for recovery of perceptual abilities from general  programs of cognitive stimulations is suggested.

Nevertheless, other cognitive functions have found to be impaired, but data are scant and not correlated with neuroimaging findings. Aims This study analyzes the neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses in preterm-born children with spastic diplegia (pSD) and their relationships with neuroanatomical findings, investigated by a novel scale for MRI classification. Methods and procedures Nineteen children with pSD, mild to moderate upper limb impairment and Verbal IQ > 80, and 38 normal controls were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (NEPSY-II), assessing Attention/Executive Functioning, Language, Memory, Sensorimotor, Social Perception and Visuospatial Processing domains. The MRIs were quantitatively scored for lesion severity. Outcomes and results The results showed that, beyond core visuo-spatial and sensory-motor deficits, impairments in attention and executive functions were present in more than half of the sample, particularly in children with damage to the anterior corpus callosum. Conclusions and implications The findings are discussed in terms of clinical and rehabilitative implications tailored for pSD subgroups diversified for neuropsychological and neuroanatomical characteristics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	No acess; but IQ test indicates age > 3 (also see below)	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in neurology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.601148	Pre-term spastic diplegia (pSD) due to periventricular leukomalacia is a form of cerebral palsy in which weaknesses in executive functions are reported beyond the  core visuo-spatial deficits. The study aimed at improving executive functioning and  visuo-spatial skills with an evidence-based training focused on working memory in  children with pSD. The intervention study followed a stepped wedge design. 19  children with pSD (11 female and 8 male; age range: 4;1-13;1 years), mild to  moderate upper limb impairment and Verbal Intelligence Quotient (VIQ) >80  participated to the study. The children were trained with a home-based adaptive  working memory training (CogMed®) over a 5-week period. The primary outcome measure  was the CogMed Improvement index; pre- and post-test explorative neuropsychological  assessment was conducted with a subset of tests from the NEPSY-II battery. Working  memory training in children with pSD significantly improved trained working memory  abilities (CogMed indices) as well as non-trained skills, such as visuo-spatial  skills, inhibition of automatic responses and phonological processing. The results  suggest that standard rehabilitation schedules for children with pSD should be  integrated with trainings on executive functions.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Even if some evidence showed BR deficits in children with cerebral palsy, a systematic study that evaluates different kinds of BR in these children, taking into account the possible presence of a general deficit affecting non-body mental representations, is currently lacking. Here we aimed at investigating BR (i.e., Body Semantics, Body Structural Representation and Body Schema) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) taking into account performance in tasks involving body stimuli and performance in tasks involving non-body stimuli. Thirty-three CP (age range: 5–12 years) were compared with a group of 103 typically-developing children (TDC), matched for age and sex. 63.64% of children with CP showed a very poor performance in body representation processing. Present data also show alterations in different body representations in CP in specific developmental stages. In particular, CP and TDC performances did not differ between 5 to 7 years old, whereas CP between 8 and 12 years old showed deficits in the Body Structural Representation and Body Schema but not in Body Semantics. These findings revealed the importance of taking into account the overall development of cognitive domains when investigating specific stimuli processing in children who do not present a typical development and were discussed in terms of their clinical implications. © 2020 by the authors.

As in previous studies, S4CAST points out the Mediterranean Sea and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as the main drivers of Sahel heavy/extreme daily rainfall variability at interannual timescales (period 1982-2015). Overall, the Mediterranean Sea emerges as a seasonal short-term predictor of heavy daily rainfall (1 month in advance), while ENSO returns a longer forecast window (up to 3 months in advance). Regarding the spatial skill, the response of heavy daily rainfall to the Mediterranean SST forcing is significant over a widespread area of the Sahel. Contrastingly, with the ENSO forcing, the response is only significant over the southernmost Sahel area. These differences can be attributed to the distinct physical mechanisms mediating the analyzed SST-rainfall teleconnections. This paper provides fundamental elements to develop an operational statistical-seasonal forecasting system of Sahel heavy and extreme daily precipitation events. © 2020 by the authors.

The American journal of psychiatry	https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.161.1.125	OBJECTIVE: The catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene affects how long dopamine acts in the prefrontal cortex. The Methionine polymorphism, which results in a  slower breakdown of prefrontal dopamine, is associated with better adult prefrontal  cortex function. The authors investigated the relation between the COMT gene  polymorphism and cognitive performance in children. METHOD: Children were tested on  cognitive tasks that depend on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and seem to be  sensitive to the level of dopamine there (dots-mixed task), depend on that neural  region but appear insensitive to its dopamine content (self-ordered pointing), and  depend on other neural systems (recall memory and mental rotation). After data  collection, cheek swabs were obtained from all children. DNA was extracted and  genotyped for the COMT gene with polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Children who  were homozygous for the Methionine polymorphism performed significantly better on  the dots-mixed task but not on others. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide an  existence proof that genotypic differences can relate to differences in cognitive  performance in typically developing children. The authors achieved a level of  specificity never previously attempted; the COMT polymorphism was found to be  differentially related to performance on tasks linked to the same prefrontal region  by whether cognitive requirements of the tasks were sensitive to the level of  dopamine found. These results challenge accepted notions that since dopamine is  important for some cognitive functions dependent on the prefrontal cortex, it is  important for all. The differential sensitivity of distinct cognitive abilities to  specific neurotransmitters may make possible targeted pharmacological interventions.

Evidence is provided that the timing of this disruption is under genetic control. Regardless of their age, girls in the midst of pubertal change encode faces less efficiently than prepubescent or postpubescent controls. This maturational influence on face encoding is contrasted with a different effect of pubertal development on another visuo-spatial ability, performance on the Embedded Figures Test (EFT). Regardless of their pubertal status at time of testing, girls who mature earlier are disadvantaged on EFT compared to those who mature later. The results for EFT replicate earlier findings on the relation between individual differences in the age at which adolescence begins and certain spatial skills. Several possible explanations for each of these effects-that of maturational status on face encoding and that of maturation rate on EFT-are discussed. Consideration of the relation between physical and mental growth is advocated as a source of constraints on explanations of cognitive development. © 1983.

As it is not synthesized by the human organism, it must be obtained by exogenous sources. A reduction in thiamine tissue concentration may interfere with numerous cellular mechanisms triggering off neurodegenerative processes with consequent changes in brain functions. Thiamine deficiency is common in certain groups like alcohol chronic users, pregnant woman, and people living in food insecurity situation. The low offer of thiamine for newborn and infants can compromise the correct maturation of the central nervous system and development of the cognition as explained by animal models studies. Thiamine deficiency during pregnancy and breastfeeding induces dysfunctions in the learning and consolidation of spatial abilities of offspring that can compromise the access of children living in food insecurity situations to formal job and education. Observed from this perspective, thiamine deficiency in vulnerable populations plays a more important role than the manifestation of clinical syndromes: the thiamine deficiency can be understood as a mechanism for perpetuating the poverty condition. Based on favorable risk/benefit profile, we recommend the fortification of easily accessible foods (such as wheat flour) with thiamine and oral replacement for alcohol dependent people, pregnant women, and infants living in situations of food insecurity. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

The method of diagnosing a disability using a discrepancy between ability and achievement test scores has received criticism, and based upon the learning disability literature, a viable alternative is to diagnose disability by examining skills foundational to an academic area. The current study examined the relationship between spatial abilities and arithmetic performance on the K-ABC to determine if this was a feasible approach using this test. Gender was examined separately because it has been shown to differentiate performance on spatial and arithmetic tasks.    The study used the normative sample of the K-ABC, which consisted of a pool of 2000 children sampled from across the country according to census-matched demographics. Spatial abilities were found to be most closely approximated on the Spatial Memory subtest in the ability battery. This subtest was examined in relationship to the Arithmetic subtest on the achievement battery, and a high correlation was demonstrated. The subtests were factor analyzed and subjected to structural equation modeling in order to determine the nature of the correlation.    Results suggested that the structural equation model demonstrated did not explain the correlation of the subtest factors well. It was demonstrated that the two subtests are developmentally ordered, and that the factors within each subtest are reliable. Gender was not a significant mediating factor in performance on either subtest. Directions for future development are provided.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Most of these studies found evidence that there is such a link in typically developing children or children with locomotor delay. Only a few studies have tested the consequences of this link in children with abnormal visual development because of infantile esotropia. Moreover, little is known about the effects of late surgery on motor development. Patients and Methods We assessed the motor abilities of 3- to 7-year old children with severe deficits in stereopsis due to infantile esotropia (angle ≥ 12°) and typically developing children prior to and 12 to 16 months after surgery. We used the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (Movement ABC-2). Results Prior to and one year after surgery, the strabismic children showed significantly lower global motor scores than normal children. Moreover, in the strabismic children, we found significant differences relative to the healthy children in the subscales assessing manual dexterity and balance prior to and significant differences in the subscales assessing manual dexterity and ball skills after surgery. Overall, the strabismic group did not demonstrate improvements in motor development after surgery. However, the children with a positive Bagolini striated glass test following surgery performed better in the subscale assessing balance than children with a negative Bagolini striated glass test. Conclusions Motor skills were poorer in children with infantile esotropia, both prior to and following surgery. Moreover, the children with improved binocular vision after surgery demonstrated better balance skills.

Therefore, we assessed motor  abilities (using the M-ABC-2) and visual spatial cognitive skills (using the Block  Design subtest of the WPPSI-III and a picture mental rotation task, PRT) of 5-7 year  old typically developing children (n= 17) and same-aged children with severe  deficits in stereopsis due to infantile esotropia (n= 17). Compared to the typically  developing children, children with esotropia showed significantly poorer motor  performances, especially in manual dexterity and ball skills, and significantly  poorer and slower performance on the visual spatial cognitive tasks. Especially the  girls treated for infantile esotropia needed more time to mentally rotate the  pictures of the PRT correctly. Overall, this study showed that perceptual, motor and  cognitive processes are interconnected and that children treated for infantile  esotropia had an increased risk of motor and visual spatial cognitive deficits.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12658	Pictorial symbols such as photographs, drawings, and maps are ubiquitous in modern cultures. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how children relate these symbols to the  scenes that they represent. The present work investigates 4-year-old children's  (N = 144) sensitivity to extended surface layouts and objects when using drawings of  a room to find locations in that room. Children used either extended surfaces or  objects when interpreting drawings, but they did not combine these two types of  information to disambiguate target locations. Moreover, children's evaluations of  drawings depicting surfaces or objects did not align with their use of such  information in those drawings. These findings suggest that pictures of all kinds  serve as media in which children deploy symbolic spatial skills flexibly and  automatically.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The article provides an overview of completed research studies on reading psychology, revealing the changes in text perception psychology in a multimedia environment. The interaction of readers with information has changed with the proliferation of multimedia technologies. The number of people focused on the perception of images on the screen has increased. In this context, the problem of imagination development, which is linked to the symbolic nature of texts, is increasingly recognized. However, Russian and foreign researchers have not treated the problem in much detail. The article aims at analyzing the peculiarities of imagination mechanisms in terms of symbolic diversity of electronic texts and characterizing the ergonomics principle as a baseline to achieve the optimal combination of information signs in the e-book. Materials and Methods. The research methodology is built on a system of basic principles, methods and concepts of psychological activity theory and the theory of speech activity. The methodology also includes the concept of imagination, the concept of e-books, and the principle of ergonomics. The content of the ergonomics principle within the framework of electronic communication is identified by means of the modeling method. Results. The main results consist in clarifying the psychological features of electronic text perception. The article examines the topical issues of imagination development in terms of symbolic diversity inherent in electronic communication. The authors reveal the principles of holistic imagination development within the multimedia environment. It is emphasized that the replacement of the sign system in the video can lead to insufficient development of creative imagination, which is responsible for independent creation of new images, and mental transformation of reality. Conclusions. The authors conclude that it is possible to overcome the reduction of imagination in the process of reading e-books in case of applying the ergonomics principle for its symbolic diversity. The content of this principle regarding e-book are examined. The feasibility of its application for symbolic components of e-books is experimentally proved. The authors provide a range of examples of experimental practical developments in the field of educational and popular e-books for primary school children. The authors argue that the ergonomics principle is aimed at achieving the required balance of information signs for optimal imagination development. Therefore, e-book content should be based on psychological aspects of electronic text perception. © 2011-2017 NSPU Bulletin. All rights reserved.	AE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		1	1	1	NA	1	0	0	1

The analysis of developmental trajectories of visuospatial abilities in individuals with Down Syndrome (DS) remains an unexplored field of investigation to examine in depth. The study aimed to fill such a gap by examining changes in two visuospatial abilities: spatial visualization (the ability to manage spatial stimuli) and mental rotation (the ability to rotate spatial stimuli). Method. Eighty-seven participants with DS, aged between 7 and 53 years (forty-seven males and forty females), completed spatial visualization and mental rotation tasks. Changes in these two abilities were analyzed in relation to chronological age and developmental level, the latter derived from Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices. Results. Chronological age was linearly associated with spatial visualization performance, whereas mental rotation performance increased until 14 years of age and then decreased. Developmental level was linearly associated with increased performance in spatial visualization, the trend in mental rotation was segmented with an increase after 5 years of age. Furthermore, developmental trajectories in mental rotation depended on the rotation degree. Conclusion. Chronological age explains a modest quote of variance. Developmental level better describes changes in spatial visualization and mental rotation of individuals with DS. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Specifically, short- and long-term memory, attention/vigilance, and executive function (e.g. processing speed, mental flexibility, and problem solving) are affected. Cognitive deficits in aging occur in similar areas (i.e., memory and processing speed). Given that a greater percentage of older adults experience sleep-disordered breathing as compared to middle-aged adults, it is possible that OSA may account for some of the deficits typically attributed to aging. This study investigated this hypothesis by comparing middle-aged and older adults with and without OSA on computer-based measures of cognitive performance. No effect of OSA or an interaction between OSA and age on cognitive function was found; an effect of age on processing speed, distinguishing stimuli rapidly, attention, spatial ability/mental flexibility, and both working memory and short-term visual memory was found. This study also explored whether or not cognitive function may be improved in persons with OSA by re-assessing those participants one month after treatment. An effect of treatment on improvements on processing speed, distinguishing stimuli rapidly, mental flexibility, and short term memory was found. Overall, findings reflect the ability of treatment to improve cognitive function among OSA patients, regardless of lack of deficits when compared to those without OSA.

This paper strengthens this argument by showing that human infant's object tracing can be understood as a slow intelligence and be simulated in this framework. We first introduce an experiment on infant's capability of object tracing, and present two rules in psychology which govern object tracing results under certain conditions, namely, the rule of minimal spatial transformation and the rule of categorical continuity. We review related works and reduce object tracing problems into the problem of object mapping. We show that the following capabilities can be simulated in the slow intelligence framework: the capability of acquiring knowledge about one scene, and the capability of mapping object between scenes. An experiment result is briefly outlined. Some discussions and outlooks are presented.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

However, how geography courses affect map-based spatial ability has not been well documented. In this study, we use an eye-tracking method to explore the impact of geography courses on map-based spatial ability. We recruited 55 undergraduates from Beijing Normal University (BNU) to attend the map-based spatial ability test before and after six-month geography courses arranged by the Faculty of Geographical Science, BNU. The results show that the participants' map-based spatial ability significantly improved after taking the geography courses; specifically, accuracy increased by 22.3% and response time decreased by 14.7% after training. We analysed two types of eye-movement behaviour; in terms of processing measures, the fixation duration of the topographic map decreased by 18.4% and the fixation distribution was more concentrated after training, and in terms of matching measures, participants have more switch times per second for both photographed scenes and topographic maps. Switch times between options decreased by 48.2%, which is a notable decrease. These empirical results are helpful for the design of geography courses that improve map-based spatial ability. © 2018 by the authors.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Spatial learning and memory of rats were measured by the Morris water maze test; the expressions of M1 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) at the protein level in the hippocampus and cortex were detected by immunohistochemistry; and the levels of O2 ●- and malondiadehyde (MDA) were evaluated by biochemical methods. The results showed that high fluoride inhibited learning ability and memory of the rats, reduced the protein expressions of both M1 and M3 mAChRs, and elevated the levels of O2 ●- and MDA in the rat brains. Interestingly, the treatment of Vit E prevented the increased production of O2 ●- and MDA in brains of the rats fed with high fluoride. In addition, Vit E attenuated the decreased learning ability and memory of the rats exposed to high fluoride, and the mechanism for this may involve the recovered expression of mAChRs resulting from the use of the antioxidant. © 2017, ISFR.

In the current paper, we focus on spatial abilities that are typically related to the dorsal visual pathway (i.e., spatial/motion processing). Bringing together evidence from cataract-reversal individuals, early- and late-blind individuals and sight-recovery cases of long-standing blindness, we suggest that the dorsal spatial pathway is mostly plastic early in life and is then more resistant to subsequent experience once it is set, highlighting some limits of neuroplasticity. © 2012 Giulia Dormal et al.

Method Twenty-eight individuals (15 females, 13 males) with childhood DM1 (mean age 17y, SD 4.6, range 7-24y) were assessed using standardized instruments and cognitive testing of general intelligence, visual attention, and visual-spatial construction abilities. Results Nineteen patients had repeated a school grade. The mean (SD) Full-scale IQ was 73.6 (17.5) and mean Verbal IQ was significantly higher than the mean Performance IQ: 80.2 (19.22) versus 72.95 (15.58), p=0.01. Fifteen patients had one or more diagnoses on the DSM-IV axis 1, including internalizing disorders (phobia, n=7; mood disorder, n=6; other anxiety disorders, n=5) and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, inattentive subtype (n=8). Twelve out of 22 patients had alexithymia (inability to express feelings with words and to recognize and share emotional states). Cognitive testing found severe impairments in visual attention and visual-spatial construction abilities in four out of 18, and 14 out of 24 patients respectively. No diagnosis was correlated with the transmitting parent's sex or with cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeat numbers. Patients with severe visual-spatial construction disabilities had a significantly longer CTG expansion size than those with normal visual-spatial abilities (p=0.04). Interpretation Children and adolescents with childhood DM1 have frequent diagnoses on DSM-IV axis 1, with internalizing disorders being the most common type of disorder. They also have borderline low intelligence and frequent impairments in attention and visual-spatial construction abilities. © The Authors.

Previous reforms have met with little success. We argue that current efforts will succeed only if we integrate ideas from geography, child development, and education. Programs of geographic education must link geographic content with an understanding of the nature of the learner and with the expectations and knowledge of the teacher. We illustrate this argument using the Guidelines for Geographic Education: Elementary and Secondary Schools (1984). The concept of a map is central to the Guidelines: of 30 suggested learning outcomes for kindergarten through second grade, 13 depend upon understanding maps. We explore early map understanding by linking Piagetian developmental theory, cartographic theory, and educational practice. We discuss empirical data on the young child's (1) understanding of maps as graphic representations, (2) ability to use a classroom map, and (3) ability to understand the concept of geographic hierarchy. Successful reform of the geographic curriculum is possible if we match an understanding of geographic content with an appreciation of the development of logical and spatial skills in children. © 1988, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

A sample of 403 (133 males, 270 females) undergraduates in Introductory Psychology courses at University of New Brunswick, NB, Canada and Creighton University, NE, USA completed verbal and spatial tests and recalled their involvement in childhood activities. Convergent and divergent validity were assessed by correlating spatial and masculine scales of the Activities Questionnaire with spatial and verbal measures.

It is aimed at encouraging and rehabilitating neuropsychological processes of attention, behaviour and cognition (visual and spatial abilities, elemental and complex motor abilities and conceptual functions). Subject: This study was aimed at children with mild intellectual disabilities with the emphasis on their cognitive and behavioural functioning in relation to different aspects of the applied treatment strategies. Material and methods: The sample consists of 124 examinees with mild intellectual disability, of both genders, aged between 8 and 13, attending primary schools in Belgrade. In this research we applied the Trial Making Test (TMT; Reitan, 1971) for attention assessment, the IOWA Conners' Rating Scale for Children for behaviour assessment, and the Test of Concept Utilization (TCU; Crager and Lane, 1981) for the assessment of cognitive functions. Results: The results indicate the presence of developmental disabilities in the examined areas in more than 50% of the tested children and a high statistically significant correlation between the applied treatment modalities and tested abilities and functions (r=0.52-0.59, df<0.01). The study points out the necessity of implementing the multimodal approach: team work of professionals and non-professionals (cooperation between professionals and parents), complementary treatment (medical and special treatment, psychosocial interventions, combination of treatment strategies), psychotherapy and psycho-pharmacotherapy when necessary, as well as special education and rehabilitation, based on individual education programs and individual training programs (IEP and ITP) and special rehabilitation procedures and methods. Conclusion: New treatment strategies, with the emphasis on special rehabilitation treatment, were proposed in conclusion. © The British Society for Developmental Disabilities 2014.

Is this talent a splinter skill, or is it associated with other kinds of high ability? We administered IQ and visual–spatial tasks to 12 precocious realists and compared their performance to a control group of children matched on age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES) and asked their parents to complete questionnaires assessing their children’s personality traits. Precocious realism proved unrelated to either superior verbal or nonverbal IQs and proved related only to two of the five visual–spatial tasks we administered. Precocious realists scored higher on the trait of openness to experience and their parents described them as having extreme rage to master. Contrary to some previous claims, they did not show any elevated autistic-like traits. We conclude by making education recommendations for artistically gifted children. ©, Copyright © The Roeper Institute.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, there is still much to do in evaluating the cognitive effects of training using these displays. The purpose of this research is to determine if the level of expertise in the haptic exploration, and the perception of the raised line materials, may enhance blind people's spatial imagery. We have observed that in all the tasks in this study (mental rotation, mental spatial displacement and estimation of length tasks) the congenitally blind experts performed better than the early and late blind non-experts, and that the early blind experts performed even better than the late blind non-experts. These observations suggest that a high level of expertise in congenitally and early blind people may compensate for the impairment in spatial representation often resulting from lack of visual experience.

PloS one	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235884	Past research has largely ignored children's ability to conjointly manipulate spatial and temporal information, but there are indications that the capacity to do  so may provide important support for reasoning about causal processes. We  hypothesised that spatial-temporal thinking is central to children's ability to  identify the invisible mechanisms that tie cause and effect together in continuous  casual processes, which are focal in primary school science and crucial to  understanding of the natural world. We investigated this in two studies (N = 107, N  = 124), employing two methodologies, one shorter, the other more in depth. Further  tasks assessed spatial-temporal (flow of liquid, extrapolation of relative speed,  distance-time-velocity), spatial (two mental rotation, paper folding), verbal  (expressive vocabulary), and nonverbal (block design) ability. Age dependent  patterns were detected for both causal and predictor tasks. Two spatial-temporal  tasks were unique and central predictors of children's causal reasoning, especially  inference of mechanism. Nonverbal ability predicted the simpler components of causal  reasoning. One mental rotation task predicted only young children's causal thinking.  Verbal ability became significant when the sample included children from a wide  range of socioeconomic backgrounds. Causal reasoning about continuous processes,  including inferences of causal mechanism, appears to be within the reach of children  from school entry age, but mechanism inference is uncommon. Analytic forms of  spatial-temporal capacity seem to be important requirements for children to progress  to this rather than merely perceptual forms.

Parents' question use in dyadic interactions and the relation to preschool-aged children's math abilities.	Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2021.105213	The cognitive complexity of adults' questions, particularly during shared book reading, supports children's developing language skills. Questions can be described  as having low cognitive demand (CD; e.g., labeling, matching) or high-CD (e.g.,  comparing, predicting). Little is known about the relation between different types  of parental questioning and children's math abilities. The current study examined  the quantity of low- and high-CD and domain-specific math questions that parents  posed to their 4-year-old children in three structured activities and how the  frequency of those questions relates to children's concurrent math and language  skills. Parent-child dyads (n = 121) were observed interacting with a picture book,  grocery store toys, and a puzzle for about 5 min each, and children completed math  and spatial assessments. Although the frequency with which parents asked questions  did not relate to children's outcomes, parents' use of high-CD questions was  associated with children's spatial skills, standardized math scores, and vocabulary  skills after controlling for parental utterances, child utterances, child age, and  family socioeconomic status. However, domain-specific math questions were not  related to any child outcomes above and beyond parents' total questions. This study  suggests that domain-general questions that vary in CD (low and high) are  differentially related to children's math and language abilities, which can inform  the ways in which parents engage in early learning opportunities with their  children.

The assets are in the verbal and auditory domains, the deficits in visual and tactile processing, and in dealing with novel material. However, there are no accepted criteria for the diagnosis of NLD. This thesis investigated the extent to which children with Verbal > Performance IQ discrepancies showed the NLD profile of assets and deficits.    The thesis began with a large-scale correlational study of mixed-ability primary aged children, to establish the concurrent predictors of variations in reading and arithmetic skills. The cognitive and motor skills of children with Verbal > Performance IQ discrepancies were then assessed. Children and young people with discrepancy-defined NLD showed poorer mathematics achievement and mental rotation skills than age-matched controls. The children were also impaired on some aspects of fine motor control, and were marginally slower than controls on a visual search task.    The subsequent study assessed a range of number processing and arithmetic skills with reference to Dehaene's (1992) triple code model of numerical processing. Children with discrepancy-defined NLD did not show impairment of a specific number processing system (i.e., Arabic-visual, auditory-verbal or analogue-magnitude). Rather, the children were poorer than age-matched controls on tasks involving Arabic digits in combination with other representations, arithmetic problem solving, and counting speed.    The final study investigated visual paired-associate learning of symbolic relationships. The study showed that the groups did not differ overall, although children with discrepancy-defined NLD showed a nonsignificant trend towards poorer symbol-magnitude learning.    The findings have implications for the relationship between NLD and arithmetic difficulties, and for the assessment and management of mathematics difficulties in children with discrepancy-defined NLD.

Evidence is inconsistent, ranging from inferior to superior visual-spatial abilities in individuals with dyslexia. Using a variety of visual-spatial tasks, this study tested the hypothesis that dyslexia is associated with superior visual-spatial ability. The results suggest that children with dyslexia performed equivalently to the controls on most tasks. On one measure, however, they were superior.

It is currently unknown whether mental rotation is also associated with prenatal testosterone exposure and testosterone-related genetic polymorphisms. The aim of our study was to analyze associations between mental rotation performance, the actual testosterone levels, the prenatal testosterone level (expressed as 2D:4D ratio) and the androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism in intellectually gifted boys. One hundred forty-seven boys aged 10-18 years with IQ>130 were enrolled. Saliva samples were collected and used for ELISA of actual levels of salivary testosterone. The 2D:4D finger length ratio as an indicator of prenatal testosterone was measured on both hands and averaged. Amthauer mental rotation test was used for the assessment of this spatial ability. The CAG repeat polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene was analyzed using PCR and capillary electrophoresis. Linear regression revealed that 2D:4D finger length ratio and the number of CAG repeats in the androgen receptor gene were associated with mental rotation. Actual levels of testosterone did not correlate significantly with mental rotation. Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that after adjustment of age as a confounding variable, only the effect of the genetic polymorphism was significant. The results are in line with our previous genetic analysis of intellectually gifted boys showing the importance of CAG repeat polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene. Details of the interactions between androgen signaling, testosterone levels and its metabolism especially during the prenatal development of brain function remain to be elucidated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

(BL)		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/study-factors-which-influence-spatial/docview/301394600/se-2?accountid=11531	This thesis is concerned with an investigation into the spatial decentration skills of a group of deaf children, aged 6 years to 10 years.  The main experiment was based on the Piagetian 'mountain scene' test in which children were required to calculate how a stimulus array appeared from another point of view.It was found that the deaf children were retarded in spatial decentring skills compared with hearing peers, although this retardation was not complete, depending on such factors as response type and whether or not the deaf subjects were in receipt of feedback about their performances.Data were interpreted as indicating that the deaf children's disadvantage may be due to a tendency to use a holistic rather than an analytic mode of thinking across tasks.  This proposition found some support in the results of a series of subsidiary experiments, e.g. 'mental rotation of matrices' and 'cerebral specialisation for visual stimuli.'

Ten object drawing tasks were used.  These were designed to assess the relative success of the children's ability to depict aspects of pictorial depth.  In addition four human figure drawing tasks were included.  It was found that the autistic children did not show deviant, but rather delayed graphic development in the use of depth cues in their drawings of objects.  There were neither qualitative nor quantitative differences among the three younger groups in the human figure drawing tasks.  Two autistic savant artists were also studied:  LH, a 15-year-old girl, and NY, a 20-year-old male.  Comparisons were made both between these two savants and also to two artistic control groups matched on chronological age.  In addition, comparisons were made between LH and NY and several mental age-matched non-gifted groups; these included normal children, autistic and mentally retarded (non-autistic) subjects.  Extensive experimentation revealed that the two savants differed in the nature of drawing strategies which underlie their special talents and these differences are systematically related to differences in underlying drawing-related cognitive abilities such as spatial ability and visual memory.  It was also found that the strategies used by LH differed from those used by the 15-year-old artists, while NY resembled normal 15-year-old artists.

In contrast, for the blind, it has been suggested that vision is crucial for adaptive spatial processing, with those who have never seen being forced to rely on an egocentric encoding of the spatial environment (e.g. Millar 1994; Ungar 2000). This brings into question the nature of the spatial mental representations used by the blind, and indeed whether or not the blind are able to construct 'allocentric' mental maps in the same way as are the sighted. Using a tactile version of the Taylor and Tversky (1992) paradigm, this experiment compared the capacity of the blind and sighted to generate mental maps, derived from verbal description. Method: Twenty sighted and 20 congenitally or early-totally blind individuals, age and IQ matched individuals listened to two environments described from a survey perspective and two from a route perspective, responding to a series of true/false statements after each text. They were also required to generate tactile maps of two of the four environments. Results: Initial comparisons indicated that there was no difference between the blind and sighted on this task. However, when the blind group was split into subgroups of: born totally blind but premature (retinopathy of prematurity); born totally blind but not premature and finally early blind (total sight loss at 12-24 months old), differences between the blind and sighted were identified. Specifically, those with retinopathy of prematurity performed significantly worse than not only did the sighted, but also those who were blind from birth but not premature and the early blind. There were no differences in performance between the born totally blind (not premature) and the sighted, with a trend towards the early blind, and not the sighted, out-performing all the other groups. Conclusions: The implication of the spatial ability subgroups within the 'early blind' group is profound. If a lack of vision does not result in a performance deficit on this very complex allocentric task, then vision is not necessary for the development of an adaptive spatial framework. Nevertheless, if the 'early' blind, with their minimal visual experience, can be considered super-performers, then vision does have an important role to play in the setting up of an optimum spatial framework, although too much may be detrimental to the construction of an optimal allocentric spatial framework. These results are considered in the context of current theories on spatial processing. © Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag 2006.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

We further investigated this effect, controlling for visible facial information in front and back view by presenting figures' faces as profile. Children's and adults' judgments were still faster and less error prone if figures were presented from the back. Moreover, reaction times indicated that participants did not mentally rotate figures in front view. Children performed overall more poorly than adults, but there were also qualitative differences suggesting that children are more susceptible to embodiment effects than adults. This study underlines that embodiment may have differential effects in spatial transformation tasks, enhancing or impairing performance. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

We examined whether 2-year-olds (N = 28) are already able to track spatial rotations (i.e., by 90° and 180°) if the task is facilitated by increasing the visual discriminability of the hiding containers by means of different shapes and different colors. Children performed above chance level in all conditions except for the condition in which containers had the same color and shape and were rotated by 180°. Moreover, children found the hidden object more often when the containers had different—as compared to identical—shapes, whereas performance was similar when the containers had the same or different colors. Furthermore, their performance was better after 90° rotations than after 180° rotations and children in all conditions showed an inhibition bias. Our findings suggest that 2-year-olds are already able to track spatial rotations if the task is kept simple and focuses solely on the ability of interest. In addition, young children use shape—rather than color—as a salient dimension in spatial rotation tasks. © International Congress of Infant Studies (ICIS)	AE	0	0	0	0	0	0	1		ASK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	not sure about task and stat: cups that are round or square, task/measure is reidentifying after rotation and changing position	7	7	1	5	5	1	1	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01648	Tracking objects that are hidden and then moved is a crucial ability related to object permanence, which develops across several stages in early childhood. In  spatial rotation tasks, children observe a target object that is hidden in one of  two or more containers before the containers are rotated around a fixed axis.  Usually, 30-month-olds fail to find the hidden object after it was rotated by 180°.  We examined whether visual discriminability of the containers improves  30-month-olds' success in this task and whether children perform better after 90°  than after 180° rotations. Two potential hiding containers with same or different  colors were placed on a board that was rotated by 90° or 180° in a within-subjects  design. Children (N = 29) performed above chance level in all four conditions. Their  overall success in finding the object did not improve by differently colored  containers. However, different colors prevented children from showing an inhibition  bias in 90° rotations, that is, choosing the empty container more often when it was  located close to them than when it was farther away: This bias emerged in the same  colors condition but not in the different colors condition. Results are discussed in  view of particular challenges that might facilitate or deteriorate spatial rotation  tasks for young children.	AE	0	0	0	0	0	0	1		ASK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	same	7	7	1	5	5	1	1	1

It also investigates children's patterns of engaging in spontaneous mathematical activities in free-play activity centers in relation to behaviors associated with classroom achievement such as attention/persistence, self-regulation, perceived math ability, and motivation. A mixed method design with structured empirical measures and naturalistic observations was used. Several data sources were analyzed, including videotaped interviews, systematic observational data, and teacher ratings. Findings indicate that children who spontaneously focus on numerosity are advanced in their counting skills. Teacher rating of motivation and interest is also correlated with counting skills and spatial skills. Teacher rating of persistence is correlated with counting skills and child self-reports of persistence in math correlated with spatial skills. Variability existed in free play activity time, with social or dramatic play the only activity observed for all children. The major math activities chosen were those involving block construction and some computer games. It was noted that students less skilled in math tended to choose less cognitively challenging activities involving small motor tasks rather than more cognitively challenging activities. Using a Vygotskian socio-cultural lens, several suggestions are made about how verbal interactions with teachers and other adults may contribute to children's cognitive competence in math. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-005-0020-y	The profile of spatial ability is of interest across autism spectrum disorders (ASD) because of reported spatial strengths in ASD and due to the recent association of  Asperger's syndrome with Nonverbal Learning Disability. Spatial functions were  examined in relation to two cognitive theories in autism: the central coherence and  executive function (EF) theories. Performance on spatial tasks, EFs, and  global/local processing was compared in children with ASD and controls. While the  ASD group had faster reaction times on the Embedded Figures task, spatial  performance was intact, but not superior, on other tasks. There was no evidence for  impairments in EF or in processing global/local information, therefore contradicting  these two theories. The implications of these results for these two theories are  discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

There is also extensive research on the link between mathematical ability and spatial ability. This research study seeks to build on both areas of research and identify ways in which they are interrelated. Conceptual knowledge of arithmetic operations is the subject of ongoing research. When solving a three-term problem of the form a x b ÷ b, those who understand the inversion concept do not need to perform any calculations because they know that the multiplication and division operations cancel each-other out. When solving a three-term problem of the form a x b ÷ c, those who understand the associativity concept know that they can do b ÷ c first, or a x b first.Research indicates that there is a complex relationship between spatial ability and mathematical ability. In some studies spatial ability is shown to have an especially strong relationship with certain measures of mathematical performance while in other studies this is not the case. Theories have already been put forth that visual-spatial abilities are initially cardinal to learning mathematics in children, but verbal and general intelligence become more important to mathematical performance later on, after these mathematical skills and forms of knowledge have been well learned. In this study it is theorized that spatial abilities are more important than other cognitive abilities for acquiring new mathematical knowledge across the lifespan, and not just in childhood. Conversely, general intelligence is more important to mathematical performance after the relevant mathematical knowledge has been well learned. This theory is supported by past research as well as the results of this study. This study also provides important clues about the development of conceptual knowledge of arithmetic by showing that knowledge of the inversion concept and the associativity concept are both strongly related to spatial ability. Verbal reasoning ability doesn’t relate to knowledge of these concepts but it is related to performance with mathematical skills that are more basic.

An analysis of the spelling errors of poor spellers was used to identify those with good phonological skills.  Children were categorised as good phonology poor spellers (GPPS), poor phonology poor spellers (PPPS) and good spellers. As predicted, GPPS included a significantly lower proportion of left handers (2%) than PPPS (24%) and good spellers (8%). The finding that GPPS were strongly right handed was robust, as shown by a measure of hand skill asymmetry for peg moving. Three tests of visuo-spatial processing found no differences in performance between any of the subgroups when intelligence was controlled.  However, when it was asked whether GPPS use their visuo-spatial skills in a literacy task, correlations suggested that, unlike PPPS and good spellers, GPS did not use their visuo-spatial skills in homophone discrimination.  This finding is consistent with an over reliance on language skills. An Eetest spelling pattern completion test was developed to test the strength of visual representations of spelling patterns in the subgroups. GPPS were significantly poorer at Eetest that PPPS and good spellers, and were no better than age appropriate readers over two years younger. This suggested that GPPS’ spelling problems were associated with the weak development of visual spelling pattern representations.  A replication of the association between poor spelling pattern completion and strong right handeness was also found in undergraduates.

Even boys as young as 4 1/2 perform better than girls on simplified spatial transformation tasks. The goal of our study was to explore ways of improving 5-year-olds' performance on a spatial transformation task and to examine the strategies children use to solve this task. We found that boys performed better than girls before training and that both boys and girls improved with training, whether they were given explicit instruction or just practice. Regardless of training condition, the more children gestured about moving the pieces when asked to explain how they solved the spatial transformation task, the better they performed on the task, with boys gesturing about movement significantly more (and performing better) than girls. Gesture thus provides useful information about children's spatial strategies, raising the possibility that gesture training may be particularly effective in improving children's mental rotation skills.

However, most school curricula do not address this spatial issue, probably because spatial ability is a general rather than domain-specific skill and also due to debate regarding individuals’ ability to transfer general skills to novel tasks. In particular, little is known about elementary school children’s object structure perspective-taking (OSPT) ability. We developed an age-appropriate OSPT assessment tool and examined differences in OSPT ability between 1st and 4th graders who did or did not receive OSPT training; children’s OSPT ability in relation to 3 object types: detailed everyday objects, contour only, and abstract geometrical target objects; the ability to identify a view seen by an observer and the ability to determine the vantage point from which a given view is seen; and problem-solving involving far transfer and difficult items. Problem-solving strategies and relations between these young children’s OSPT performance and their mathematic achievements were examined to further investigate the possible contribution of spatial ability to STEM learning. Our findings are promising in that a relatively short training effected significantly children’s OSPT ability—a general intellectual skill—calling for the development and introduction of OSPT-relevant K-12 curriculum, possibly using our training program as a model. Such curriculum is relevant in particular for girls, of whom OSPT showed significant correlation with mathematic scores for contoured and geometric objects. Fourth graders performed better than 1st graders, but the latter improved more. © 2018, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Different types of play relate to different skills and vary by gender, such as spatial play and spatial skill (Jirout &amp; Newcombe, 2015; Voyer, Voyer, &amp; Bryden, 1995), and very little is known about gender and digital play. This study assessed parent and child gendered beliefs about play preference and ability with spatial and non-spatial toys and screen media, parent-rated educational value of toys, and frequency of child play (N = 60 parent-child dyads; Mage = 5.5). Though parents reported some stereotypical beliefs, especially for preferences, they considered screen media neutral. Children's responses only related to parents' for spatial preference, and were egocentric across toy types. Ratings of educational value related to play frequency and were lower for screen media than physical toys. Additional results and implications are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Eye movements while reading were recorded. We found some improvement of visual acuity and visual fields with time. After a two-year follow-up, three children were able to read print, although one of them preferred Braille. One child, who had spastic diplegia, could not read print or Braille, but could type on a keyboard with the help of synthesized speech. The children had difficulties making eye movements during reading; they compensated with head movements. © 2000 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

In particular, the research has aimed to discover more about the nature of the influences of certain factors that are thought to be a cause of differential environmental learning between individuals. Principal amongst these factors of interest have been gender, spatial ability, environmental disposition and modes of interaction with the environment. As a field of concern, the study has fallen within the domains of behavioural geography and environmental psychology (or within what some choose to call 'environment and behaviour' research). As such, the approach has been multi-disciplinary. Most theoretical input into the study has come from the learning and developmental theories of those who have studied child development. The study has adopted a part-longitudinal, part-cross-sectional framework, in order that the disadvantages of each might be minimized. Four separate field studies have been conducted using groups of individuals who had been living in the city of Leicester for three months, six months, twelve months and three years or more. The three month and three year groups were interviewed only once, but the six and twelve month groups were comprised of the same individuals, thus constituting the cross-sectional element. A total of one hundred and forty-six lengthy interviews were conducted by the researcher over the period of one year. Respondents have been selected on the basis of their length of residence in the city. Limitations of time and manpower have dictated the sample sizes, which have in turn demanded that certain variables not of primary interest to the present research but which might be expected to influence environmental learning, be controlled. As a reasonably homogeneous group on many of these variables (e.g. age, socio-economic status, life-style, life-cycle stage, and location of place of residence and place of work (and thus activity space)), postgraduate students and new members of academic staff to the University in the academic years of 1985 and 1986 have been chosen as the study population. A random sampling procedure has been adopted for the selection of respondents from this population for the sample groups. The interview schedules have contained a mixture of questions and tests/exercises which were aimed at eliciting the following information; the personal characteristics of the respondent, macro-spatial ability, environmental disposition and knowledge of the Leicester environment. Previous studies of this nature have concentrated on certain aspects of environmental knowledge (such as knowledge of distances between landmarks, or knowledge of the layout of the city centre), but this study has adopted a holistic approach aiming to achieve an insight into the acquisition of knowledge in general with all its interacting component parts. Thus the study has concentrated on both the quantity and quality of knowledge, and has questioned respondents on aspects of the city which have ranged from the structure of the city centre, to the nature of local industry and the geographical distribution of the unemployed. Information has been elicited using techniques which included sketch mapping, abstract spatial tests, response to both iconic and aerial photographs and normal questioning. The resulting data has been coded and compiled into a data matrix which was entered onto a Vaxcluster mainframe computer. The data has been processed using SPSSx.

Aim This study was carried out to determine the frequency of cognitive impairment, no dementia after an intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke and to study their evolution toward dementia (transitions in cognitive state) during a 2-year follow-up. Methods Thirty-five patients with first-ever hemorrhagic strokes and in an age-matched and sexmatched comparison group (nonstroke, n = 20) were followed up for 2 years by three serial assessments. Stroke patients at 3, 12, 24 months after discharge were evaluated together with nonstrokes, by an extensive neuropsychological battery and clinical psychiatric interview based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disease, 4th edition TR criteria. Rates of cognitive change were compared using repeated-measures analyses. Factors associated with incident dementia and cognitive impairment, no dementia at 2 years were determined by multinomial logistic regression. Results The majority of patients (71.4%) were cognitively stable. Fewer cases improved (11.5%) and 71.1% of the stroke cases worsened at the end of the 24-month follow-up. There was impaired cognitive function in nearly all cognitive domains of stroke cases compared with nonstroke cases. Overall, stroke cases showed a statistically significant decline in mini-mental state examination (MMSE), spatial ability, and in the executive function domain; however, there was no improvement in attention nonverbal memory domains. Age at stroke onset was independently associated with cognitive impairment at the 2-year follow-up P= 0.03. Conclusion Cognitive evolution 2 years after hemorrhagic stroke is different among patients, but a substantial number of patients remain stable. Additional studies are required to reliably identify individuals at risk for cognitive decline for whom pharmacologic or other therapeutic interventions would be more suitable and who will probably spontaneously improve. Classification of stroke by etiology may be more useful to determine patients at a higher risk of stroke and for its prevention. © 2011 Okasha Institute of Psychiatry, Ain Shams University.

The DAS was developed primarily to assess children's cognitive profiles. Evidence is presented on its relatively high levels of reliable specific variance (a requirement for identifying reliable intertest differences in a profile). The DAS cognitive battery also yields a number of focused composite scores: a measure of psychometric g, called General Conceptual Ability (GCA) and measures of Verbal and Nonverbal Ability at the preschool level, and of Verbal, Nonverbal Reasoning and Spatial Ability at the school-age level. The case is argued against the use of terms “intelligence” and “IQ” in describing children's abilities, and evidence on the factorial structure of the DAS is presented through both confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses. © 1990, Sage Publications.

The purpose of this study was to determine how still visuals with varying degrees of realistic detail facilitate the learning of primary children with high and low spatial ability. The study investigated the effects that four still visual treatments had on the learning of the children, as measured on a posttest administered immediately following a slide-tape lesson and on a delayed recall test administered three weeks later.    Methodology. An experimental pretest-posttest procedure was used, employing a 2 x 4 factorial design. A slide-tape about the instruments of the orchestra was produced locally. The audio track was maintained constant in all treatment groups. The slide visuals were varied for each of four groups: color photographs (realistic); black and white photographs (semi-realistic); black and white shaded line drawings (semi-compressed); and black and white simple line drawings (compressed).    Subjects were 101 second and third grade children attending an elementary school in a midwestern United States community. The spatial ability of the subjects was measured using two subtests from the S.R.A. Primary Test of Mental Ability. The children were divided according to spatial ability and randomly assigned to the treatment groups.    Results. An analysis of variance was performed on the posttest scores, delayed recall test scores, and on the gains associated with these two tests. Results indicated only one major effect for visual treatment (p < .05). When color photographs were compared to black and white photographs, the colored visuals were found to be significantly better in facilitating learning. There were no significant results for spatial ability. Subjects high and low in spatial ability performed equally well on the test measures. There was no interaction effect between treatment and spatial ability. Subjects in the most realistic treatment groups showed a more positive attitude toward the visuals they viewed (p < .10).    Conclusions. There is little support for the visual realism continuum theory, unless color photographs are compared with black and white photographs. Spatial ability, as measured by spatial aptitude tests, is not a good predictor of learning success on visual learning tasks. Children seem to prefer still visuals which are lifelike and in color.

Higher spatial skills have been linked to higher STEM achievement, while use of computer visualizations has mixed results for helping various students with different spatial levels. This study endeavors to better understand the difference between what high and low spatial-skilled middle school students notice and interpret while using a plate tectonic computer visualization. Also, we examine the differences in the quantity and quality of students’ spatial language. The collected data include student spatial scores, student interviews, screencasts, and online artifacts. The artifacts were students’ answers to questions inserted in an online curriculum (GEODE) with the embedded computer visualization (Seismic Explorer). Students were asked what they “noticed” during interviews and in the curriculum. Typed student answers and interviews were analyzed for types and quantity of spatial words. Analysis of typed answers and interviews indicated that there are differences in the number and types of spatial words used by high or low spatial students. Additionally, high spatial learners talk about depth, notice patterns in data and are more likely to make a hypothesis to explain what they see on the screen. Findings suggest that students go through an iterative cycle of noticing and interpreting when using a scientific model. Overall, results show a significant positive relationship between spatial skills and what students notice while learning plate tectonics. An explanation for the increased gain in plate tectonics comprehension is that students with higher spatial skills notice more, so they are able to interpret more details of the model. This finding implies that students with low spatial skills do not benefit as much from use of a computer visualization and will need more scaffolding in order to interpret details in the computer visualization. © 2020, The Author(s).

In contrast, sex effects in response times in the mental rotation task are small or absent. In recent years, a number of studies using different stimuli and experimental approaches investigated sex differences in mental rotation in infants with inconsistent results. The goal of the present study was to examine on the basis of a sufficient statistical power (a) whether infants aged 5–6 (N = 208) or 9–10 months (N = 168) are able to use mental rotation in a habituation task with complex and dynamic 3D cube figures rotated in depth; (b) whether there were sex differences present, (c) whether looking times at 5–6 months can predict looking times at 9–10 months, and finally, (d) whether 9-month-olds’ looking times during mental rotation depend upon their crawling ability. Our data suggest that the habituation paradigm is suited to reveal mental rotation in 5- to 6-month-old infants (although the effects are small) but not in older ones. Moreover, we obtained no evidence for sex differences, we found no stability of looking times across infancy, and obtained no evidence suggesting an effect of crawling experience on mental rotation ability. More studies based on sufficiently large sample sizes are needed to evaluate mental rotation and possible sex differences in infancy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Neuroscience letters	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2019.134298	Sex differences in mental rotation, robust in adults, have recently been reported for infants' looking times although the pattern of results is not completely  conclusive. In this context, organizational effects of gonadal steroids affecting  the neural circuitry underlying spatial cognition could be (partly) responsible for  the early sex difference. In the present study testosterone and estradiol levels  measured in amniotic fluid via ultra performance liquid chromatography and tandem  mass spectrometry were used to examine the role of prenatal sex hormones on infants'  looking times during mental rotation. N = 208 six-month-old infants participated in  an expectation of violation task with 3D cube figures. Mental rotation was defined  as the difference in looking times for familiar versus mirrored cube figures whereas  vigilance was defined as the sum of both looking times. Sex differences were absent  for mental rotation as well as for vigilance. Most importantly, however, for boys  mental rotation but not vigilance was correlated with prenatal testosterone but not  with estradiol. For girls mental rotation but not vigilance was correlated with  prenatal estradiol but not with testosterone although it has to be noted that the  testosterone values for girls suffered from a floor effect. Only 5% of the  within-sex variance was due to prenatal sex hormones indicating small effects. These  findings extend our knowledge concerning organizational effects of prenatal sex  hormones on the brain circuitry underlying spatial cognition.

Therefore, they are one of the key tools of skill development in public opinion since their first appearance. The physical environment creates specific limitations to these games, but new tools from computer graphics and its virtual environments allow us to reach new possibilities. We introduce an application that helps the users to try rotations on 3D models based on the rules of the well-known puzzle Rubik’s Cube. In our solution, these models could be different from the usually used symmetric and convex shapes. Copyright © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

The British journal of nutrition	https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114515000768	In humans, maximum brain development occurs between the third trimester of gestation and 2 years of life. Nutrition during these critical windows of rapid brain  development might be essential for later cognitive functioning and behaviour. In the  last few years, trends on protein recommendations during infancy and childhood have  tended to be lower than that in the past. It remains to be demonstrated that lower  protein intakes among healthy infants, a part of being able to reduce obesity risk,  is safe in terms of mental performance achievement. Secondary analyses of the EU  CHOP, a clinical trial in which infants from five European countries were randomised  to be fed a higher or a lower protein content formula during the 1st year of life.  Children were assessed at the age of 8 years with a neuropsychological battery of  tests that included assessments of memory (visual and verbal), attention (visual,  selective, focused and sustained), visual-perceptual integration, processing speed,  visual-motor coordination, verbal fluency and comprehension, impulsivity/inhibition,  flexibility/shifting, working memory, reasoning, visual-spatial skills and decision  making. Internalising, externalising and total behaviour problems were assessed  using the Child Behaviour Checklist 4-18. Adjusted analyses considering factors that  could influence neurodevelopment, such as parental education level, maternal  smoking, child's gestational age at birth and head circumference, showed no  differences between feeding groups in any of the assessed neuropsychological domains  and behaviour. In summary, herewith we report on the safety of lower protein content  in infant formulae (closer to the content of human milk) according to long-term  mental performance.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06216.x	From Piaget's early work to current theory of mind research, young children have been characterized as having little or no awareness of their mental activity. This  conclusion was reexamined by assessing children's conscious access to visual  imagery. Four-year-olds, 6-year-olds, and adults were given a mental rotation task  in the form of a computer game, but with no instructions to use mental rotation and  no other references to mental activity. During the task, participants were asked to  explain how they made their judgments. Reaction time patterns and verbal reports  revealed that 6-year-olds were comparable to adults both in their spontaneous use  and subjective awareness of mental rotation. Four-year-olds who referred to mental  activity to explain their performance had reaction time and error patterns  consistent with mental rotation; 4-year-olds who did not refer to mental activity  responded randomly. A second study with 5-year-olds produced similar results. This  research demonstrates that conscious access to at least 1 type of thinking is  present earlier than previously recognized. It also helps to clarify the conditions  under which young children will and will not notice and report their mental  activity. These findings have implications for competing accounts of children's  developing understanding of the mind and for the "imagery debate".

Three-year-olds understand that mental phenomena such as visual images are subjective and immaterial. They can also engage in a rudimentary form of introspection, as shown by their ability to reflect on and discuss mental images. By 5 years of age, some children not only spontaneously use mental rotation on a mental-rotation task, but they also are conscious of this mental process. These findings sharply contrast with traditional accounts of development, in which such accomplishments were believed to occur only much later. This research supports both a more positive view of young children's understanding of the mind and a greater emphasis on metacognition in early childhood education. © 1994.

There were 128 subjects, divided equally into 16 experimental groups. The variables under study were age, subject sex, instruction type, and problem type (contour-simple or contour-complex). Children of four ages were tested, 5, 7, 9, and 12. It was hypothesized that the side tasks would be simpler than the aerial tasks. It was also hypothesized that the mental rotation skills would appear in the repertoire of the children at an earlier age than the perspective taking skills. Hypotheses concerning the types of errors which would be made prior to the development of these skills for both the side tasks or the aerial ones were proposed.    It was found that the mental rotation and the perspective taking tasks were easier for children in the side view cases than in the aerial cases. In the case of the side view tasks, in general, hypotheses concerning the occurrence of various error types were confirmed in that the primary error type under both instructional conditions was the adjacency error. However, it was expected that the egocentric error should occur significantly more frequently than all error types other than the adjacency error, and this result was not found. However, hypotheses which suggested that mental rotation skills should develop at an earlier age than perspective taking skills were not supported. For the aerial tasks, the hypotheses concerning the relationship between the absolute performances of subjects in the two instructional conditions were supported only for 9-year-old boys. The results from the analyses of different error types for the aerial tasks led to the suggestion that different subject groups may use alternate modes of solution strategy to approach the same aerial task.

Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/S0010-9452(69)80024-9	It was predicted that in the absence of at least average verbal labeling skill, the ability of 4th grade boys to discriminate right from left on their own bodies and in the external environment, and to perform on a commonly used test of spatial relations, would vary directly with the degree of difference in relative usage and tactile sensitivity of the two sides of the body. In contrast, given strong verbal ability, such a relationship was expected to be found only in regard to performance on the test of spatial relations. Obtained correlation coefficients, although small, supported these predictions.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The research focuses on children with literacy acquisition problems and investigates whether such problems are related to specific areas of deficit. In the first piece of research, children with dyslexia (literacy learning problems) and dyspraxia (motor deficits) were contrasted on measures of memory (for example, tasks that required the retention of sequences of verbal material or spatial movements) and additional measures of literacy (reading and spelling), phonological (awareness of sounds within words) and motor (fine and gross motor tasks) functioning. The data were consistent with a dissociation between tasks/groups such that dyslexics showed weak phonological processing but intact visuo-spatial processing, whereas children with dyspraxia showed weaknesses on task involving visuo-spatial information, but average levels of performance on tasks that required phonological processing. Similar results were identified amongst adult groups, consistent with a deviant level of functioning rather than a developmental delay. A second line of research contrasted children with or without literacy problems across language backgrounds (English, Arabic, Chinese and bilingual children). Consistent with the dyslexia data, children with poor English literacy skills showed weaknesses in verbal/phonological memory tasks but not in visuo-spatial memory. However, for Chinese-language children, visuo-spatial memory differed between good and poor literacy learners, but there was little evidence for verbal memory differences. In contrast, the Arabic and bilingual children showed differences in both verbal and visuo-spatial areas, although the evidence was consistent with enhanced visual/spatial skills amongst the good literacy groups, rather than poor literacy children showing weaknesses in those tasks. These data suggest that the influence of memory skills on learning may vary with the language of instruction. A final line of enquiry considers whether teaching strategies to children with learning difficulties may overcome some of the identified memory deficits and lead to better levels of learning. English language children with learning difficulties were taught visual and verbal strategies to support retention of materials in short-term memory tasks. In the majority of cases, learning was improved when it focused on visuo-spatial strategies but not when verbal strategies were used. These data support the relationship between learning difficulties and different aspects of short-term memory that may lead to poor levels of learning. It also presents evidence that memory (particularly those related to visuo-spatial) processes are influenced by the context within which learning is taking place, both in terms of the language of instruction and the strategies used to support learning. For some children with educational difficulties based around language-related deficits, visuo-spatial strategies may support acquisition. © Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag 2006.

Tasks performed by the subjects included: finding alternative uses for objects, producing drawn objects from basic shapes, completing a self-report inventory which assessed innovative styles of thinking, and the solving of problems which required some form of insightful thinking. The data indicated both differences between dyslexics and non-dyslexics and differences across age groups. Compared with non-dyslexics, dyslexic adults presented consistent evidence of greater creativity in tasks requiring novelty or insight and more innovative styles of thinking; in contrast, dyslexic primary and secondary school children performed on a level with their non-dyslexic peers on a test which involved making drawings from a number of different shapes (figural creativity). Little evidence was found for an association between creativity and enhanced visuo-spatial skills or between creativity and handedness. Despite evidence being provided for the hypothesized creative talents of dyslexics, it was not possible to confirm that these talents were constitutional in nature or that they were associated with enhanced functioning of the right hemisphere.

Language functions recover particularly well, while visuo-spatial skills are more affected by brain damage, regardless of its localization. This study investigated the lateralization of language and visual search after childhood stroke. Methods: Ten patients with unilateral stroke (aged 10-19 years, five left-, five right-sided lesion) and 20 healthy controls (aged 8-20 years) completed a neuropsychological test battery and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) intended to activate predominantly right (visual search) and left-sided functional networks (language). Results: After stroke, patients demonstrated atypical lateralization of visual search functions (8/10 patients, left lateralization) more often than that of language (4/10 patients, right lateralization). There was a dissociation between the lateralization of productive and semantic language (4/10 patients, 1/20 controls) and between the lateralization of simple and complex visual search (3/10 patients, 3/20 controls). In patients, atypical contralateral activations occurred in the same areas that showed decreasing activation during development in healthy participants. Conclusion: The lateralization of functions depends upon the cognitive function measured. Dissociation between the lateralization of different language or visual search tasks can occur. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

These methods rely primarily upon the detection of differences in within sibship variances expected for segregating and non‐segregating sibships when a major locus is present. In the present study, computer simulation was used to investigate power and robustness of the test statistics. Power of the analyses depends upon the specific major locus model, but, in general, their application is quite practical for small samples. The test statistics were shown to be sensitive to deviations from normality, but robust under the conditions of either a polygenic or environmental model. Application of the test procedures to sibship data from the Boulder Family Study led to significant results for a three‐dimensional spatial rotation test, but results for height and weight were non‐significant. The simplest interpretation of the results for the spatial performance test wasin tcrms of a sex‐linked major locus. Copyright © 1978, Wiley Blackwell.

Aged 11 years 6 months, the patient displayed significant intellectual disability with proportionate impairments in attentional-executive, memory, and visuo-spatial abilities despite appearing socially "able." This discrepancy may be explained by good social-emotional skills masking his intellectual disability, by decline in cognitive abilities over time, or by unusual neuroradiological abnormalities not previously examined in Roifman syndrome. Here, we present results from a structural MRI scan, neurocognitive evaluations repeated 2 and 5 years post-baseline and assessments of face and emotional processing. The MRI revealed partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, bilateral hypoplastic hippocampi but bilaterally intact amygdala. No evidence was found for decline in the patient's neurocognitive profile. Emotional processing data indicated an age-appropriate pattern of reactivity to emotional stimuli and preserved facial identity recognition abilities, but impairments in recognition of negative facial expressions. The results confirmed a stable pattern of intellectual disability, and indicated that Roifman syndrome may be associated with major structural neuro-anatomical abnormalities. We suggest that the relative strengths in emotion and face processing are consistent with the patient's apparently able social behavior, and with intact amygdalar function. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Biological Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2006.01.011	Previous studies in animals have revealed effects of both prenatal and current testosterone on brain organization and behavior. However, it is unclear how these effects translate to the human brain. Here, we refine previous procedures to clarify the relative contribution of prenatal versus current testosterone indices to cognitive function. Sixty-nine subjects performed four computerized tasks measuring mental rotation, targeting, figure-disembedding and perceptual discrimination. Using stepwise regression analyses, performance was related to free testosterone assayed in saliva samples and to second-to-fourth finger length ratios (2D:4D), a putative index of prenatal testosterone exposure. The exclusive predictor for mental rotation was found to be sex, while 2D:4D was found to be the sole predictor of targeting, exhibiting a curvilinear relation, and figure-disembedding performance, showing a linear relation. These findings suggest a substantial role for prenatal testosterone but not current testosterone in determining cognitive performance.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-007-0419-8	It has been hypothesised that autism is an extreme version of the male brain, caused by high levels of prenatal testosterone (Baron-Cohen 1999). To test this proposal,  associations were assessed between three visuo-spatial tasks and prenatal  testosterone, indexed in second-to-fourth digit length ratios (2D:4D). The study  included children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, ASD (N = 28), and chronological as  well as mental age matched typically-developing children (N = 31). While the group  with ASD outperformed the control group at Mental Rotation and Figure-Disembedding,  these group differences were not related to differences in prenatal testosterone  level. Previous findings of an association between Targeting and 2D:4D were  replicated in typically-developing children and children with ASD. The implications  of these results for the extreme male brain (EMB) theory of autism are discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

There is substancial evidence on post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation benefits, but its implementation is generally limited by the use of paper-and-pencil methods, insufficient personalization, and suboptimal intensity. Virtual reality tools have shown potential for improving cognitive rehabilitation by supporting carefully personalized, ecologically valid tasks through accessible technologies. Notwithstanding important progress in VR-based cognitive rehabilitation systems, specially with Activities of Daily Living (ADL's) simulations, there is still a need of more clinical trials for its validation. In this work we present a one-month randomized controlled trial with 18 stroke in and outpatients from two rehabilitation units: 9 performing a VR-based intervention and 9 performing conventional rehabilitation. Methods: The VR-based intervention involved a virtual simulation of a city - Reh@City - where memory, attention, visuo-spatial abilities and executive functions tasks are integrated in the performance of several daily routines. The intervention had levels of difficulty progression through a method of fading cues. There was a pre and post-intervention assessment in both groups with the Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination (primary outcome) and the Trail Making Test A and B, Picture Arrangement from WAIS III and Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 (secondary outcomes). Results: A within groups analysis revealed significant improvements in global cognitive functioning, attention, memory, visuo-spatial abilities, executive functions, emotion and overall recovery in the VR group. The control group only improved in self-reported memory and social participation. A between groups analysis, showed significantly greater improvements in global cognitive functioning, attention and executive functions when comparing VR to conventional therapy. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cognitive rehabilitation through the Reh@City, an ecologically valid VR system for the training of ADL's, has more impact than conventional methods. Trial registration: This trial was not registered because it is a small sample study that evaluates the clinical validity of a prototype virtual reality system. © 2016 The Author(s).

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-7610.00768	Williams syndrome (WS) is a rare genetic disorder which, among other characteristics, has a distinctive cognitive profile. Nonverbal abilities are  generally poor in relation to verbal abilities, but also show varying levels of  ability in relation to each other. Performance on block construction tasks  represents arguably the weakest nonverbal ability in WS. In this study we examined  two requirements of block construction tasks in 21 individuals with WS and 21  typically developing (TD) control individuals. The Squares tasks, a novel  two-dimensional block construction task, manipulated patterns by segmentation and  perceptual cohesiveness to investigate the first factor, processing preference  (local or global), and by obliqueness to examine the second factor, the ability to  use mental imagery. These two factors were investigated directly by the Children's  Embeded Figures Test (CEFT; Witkin, Oltman, Raskin, & Karp, 1971) and a mental  rotation task respectively. Results showed that individuals with WS did not differ  from the TD group in their processing style. However, the ability to use mental  imagery was significantly poorer in the WS group than the TD group. This suggests  that weak performance on the block construction tasks in WS may relate to an  inability to use mental imagery.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1
database	Farran, E.K.	2008	journalArticle	Strategies and biases in location memory in Williams syndrome	Research in Developmental Disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2007.07.002	Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) demonstrate impaired visuo-spatial abilities in comparison to their level of verbal ability. In particular, visuo-spatial construction is an area of relative weakness. It has been hypothesised that poor or atypical location coding abilities contribute strongly to the impaired abilities observed on construction and drawing tasks [Farran, E. K., & Jarrold, C. (2005). Evidence for unusual spatial location coding in Williams syndrome: An explanation for the local bias in visuo-spatial construction tasks? Brain and Cognition, 59, 159-172; Hoffman, J. E., Landau, B., & Pagani, B. (2003). Spatial breakdown in spatial construction: Evidence from eye fixations in children with Williams syndrome. Cognitive Psychology, 46, 260-301]. The current experiment investigated location memory in WS. Specifically, the precision of remembered locations was measured as well as the biases and strategies that were involved in remembering those locations. A developmental trajectory approach was employed; WS performance was assessed relative to the performance of typically developing (TD) children ranging from 4- to 8-year-old. Results showed differential strategy use in the WS and TD groups. WS performance was most similar to the level of a TD 4-year-old and was additionally impaired by the addition of physical category boundaries. Despite their low level of ability, the WS group produced a pattern of biases in performance which pointed towards evidence of a subdivision effect, as observed in TD older children and adults. In contrast, the TD children showed a different pattern of biases, which appears to be explained by a normalisation strategy. In summary, individuals with WS do not process locations in a typical manner. This may have a negative impact on their visuo-spatial construction and drawing abilities. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Developmental Science	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00894.x	Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) show a specific deficit in visuo-spatial abilities. This finding, however, derives mainly from performance on small-scale laboratory-based tasks. This study investigated large-scale route learning in individuals with WS and two matched control groups (moderate learning difficulty group [MLD], typically developing group [TD]). In a non-labelling and a labelling (verbal information provided along the route) condition, participants were guided along one of two unfamiliar 1-km routes with 20 junctions, and then retraced the route themselves (two trials). The WS participants performed less well than the other groups, but given verbal information and repeated experience they learnt nearly all of the turns along the route. The extent of improvement in route knowledge (correct turns) in WS was comparable to that of the control groups. Relational knowledge (correctly identifying spatial relationships between landmarks), compared with the TD group, remained poor for both the WS and the MLD group. Assessment of the relationship between performance on the large-scale route-learning task and that on three small-scale tasks (maze learning, perspective taking, map use) showed no relationship for the TD controls, and only a few non-specific associations in the MLD and WS groups. © 2009 The Authors.

Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) have impaired spatial abilities. This includes a deficit in spatial navigation abilities such as learning the route from A to B. To-date, to determine whether participants attend to landmarks when learning a route, landmark recall tasks have been employed after the route learning experience. Here, we combined virtual reality and eye tracking technologies, for the first time, to measure landmark use in typically developing (TD) children and participants with WS during route-learning. Method: Nineteen individuals with WS were asked to learn a route in a sparse environment (few landmarks) and in a rich environment (many landmarks) whilst their eye movements were recorded. Looking times towards landmarks were compared to TD children aged 6, 8 and 10 years. Changes in attention to landmarks during the learning process were also recorded. Results: The WS group made fewer looks to landmarks overall, but all participants looked for longer at landmarks that were at junctions and along the paths of the maze than landmarks that were in the distance. Few differences were observed in route learning between the sparse and rich environments. In contrast to the TD groups, those in the WS group were as likely to look at non-unique landmarks as landmarks at junctions and on paths. Discussion: The current results demonstrate that attention to landmarks during route learning reflects the types of landmarks remembered in memory tasks, that individuals with WS can learn a route if given sufficient exposure, but that this is accomplished within the context of an impaired ability to select appropriate landmarks. © 2016 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Brain and Cognition	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bandc.2005.05.011	Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) display poor visuo-spatial cognition relative to verbal abilities. Furthermore, whilst perceptual abilities are delayed, visuo-spatial construction abilities are comparatively even weaker, and are characterised by a local bias. We investigated whether this differentiation in visuo-spatial abilities can be explained by a deficit in coding spatial location in WS. This can be measured by assessing participants' understanding of the spatial relations between objects within a visual scene. Coordinate and categorical spatial relations were investigated independently in four participant groups: 21 individuals with WS; 21 typically developing (TD) children matched for non-verbal ability; 20 typically developing controls of a lower non-verbal ability; and 21 adults. A third task measured understanding of visual colour relations. Results indicated first, that the comprehension of categorical and coordinate spatial relations is equally poor in WS. Second, that the comprehension of visual relations is also at an equivalent level to spatial relational understanding in this population. These results can explain the difference in performance on visuo-spatial perception and construction tasks in WS. In addition, both the WS and control groups displayed response biases in the spatial tasks. However, the direction of bias differed across the groups. This finding is explored in relation to current theories of spatial location coding. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Experiment 1 measured the ability of participants to discriminate between oblique and between nonoblique orientations. Individuals with WS showed a smaller effect of obliqueness in response time, when compared to controls matched for nonverbal mental age. Experiment 2 investigated the possibility that this deviant pattern of orientation discrimination accounts for the poor ability to perform mental rotation in WS (Farran, Jarrold, & Gathercole, 2001). A size transformation task was employed, which shares the image transformation requirements of mental rotation, but not the orientation discrimination demands. Individuals with WS performed at the same level as controls. The results suggest a deviance at the perceptual level in WS, in processing orientation, which fractionates from the ability to mentally transform images. © 2004 Psychology Press Ltd.

These poor visuo-spatial abilities have been ascribed to a local processing bias by some [R. Rossen, E.S. Klima, U. Bellugi, A. Bihrle, W. Jones, Interaction between language and cognition: evidence from Williams syndrome, in: J. Beitchman, N. Cohen, M. Konstantareas, R. Tannock (Eds.), Language, Learning and Behaviour disorders: Developmental, Behavioural and Clinical Perspectives, Cambridge University Press, New York, 1996, pp. 367-392] and conversely, to a global processing bias by others [Psychol. Sci. 10 (1999) 453]. In this study, two identification versions and one drawing version of the Navon hierarchical processing task, a non-verbal task, were employed to investigate this apparent contradiction. The two identification tasks were administered to 21 individuals with WS, 21 typically developing individuals, matched by non-verbal ability, and 21 adult participants matched to the WS group by mean chronological age (CA). The third, drawing task was administered to the WS group and the typically developing (TD) controls only. It was hypothesised that the WS group would show differential processing biases depending on the type of processing the task was measuring. Results from two identification versions of the Navon task measuring divided and selective attention showed that the WS group experienced equal interference from global to local as from local to global levels, and did not show an advantage of one level over another. This pattern of performance was broadly comparable to that of the control groups. The third task, a drawing version of the Navon task, revealed that individuals with WS were significantly better at drawing the local form in comparison to the global figure, whereas the typically developing control group did not show a bias towards either level. In summary, this study demonstrates that individuals with WS do not have a local or a global processing bias when asked to identify stimuli, but do show a local bias in their drawing abilities. This contrast may explain the apparently contrasting findings from previous studies. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in human neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.669034	Given the developmental inter-relationship between motor ability and spatial skills, we investigated the impact of physical disability (PD) on spatial cognition.  Fifty-three children with special educational needs including PD were divided into  those who were wheelchair users (n = 34) and those with independent locomotion  ability (n = 19). This division additionally enabled us to determine the impact of  limited independent physical exploration (i.e., required wheelchair use) on spatial  competence. We compared the spatial performance of children in these two PD groups  to that of typically developing (TD) children who spanned the range of non-verbal  ability of the PD groups. Participants completed three spatial tasks; a mental  rotation task, a spatial programming task and a desktop virtual reality (VR)  navigation task. Levels of impairment of the PD groups were broadly commensurate  with their overall level of non-verbal ability. The exception to this was the  performance of the PD wheelchair group on the mental rotation task, which was below  that expected for their level of non-verbal ability. Group differences in approach  to the spatial programming task were evident in that both PD groups showed a  different error pattern from the TD group. These findings suggested that for  children with both learning difficulties and PD, the unique developmental impact on  spatial ability of having physical disabilities, over and above the impact of any  learning difficulties, is minimal.

A battery of tests assessing non-verbal reasoning, visuo-spatial mental imagery, and academic achievement in geometry (i.e., geometric knowledge and geometric problem-solving competencies) was presented to 162 8-9.5-year-old pupils attending primary school. After controlling for age, significant associations were found between non-verbal reasoning abilities and knowledge in geometry (r =.31, p =.013) and geometric problem-solving skills (r =.35, p =.005), respectively. Similarly, using age as covariate, mental imagery abilities were significantly related to geometric knowledge (r = -.28, p <.001) and geometric problem-solving skills (r = -.24, p =.002), respectively. Furthermore, pupils with high visuo-spatial mental imagery abilities outperformed their peers with low visuo-spatial competences in the geometry tasks and further visuo-spatial abilities measure computed by their teachers. Finally, male participants showed better geometry skills than females. © The Author(s) 2021.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Nonetheless, despite its relevance, for many decades non-verbal abilities have been considered secondary to those implicated in further academic attainments, such as writing and reading. First, a definition of visuo-spatial abilities will be presented, then an overview of the main findings concerning the contribution of visuo-spatial working memory and related non-verbal abilities in early childhood and in primary school will be illustrated. Moreover, the impact of the atypical development of visuo-spatial abilities at school, that is, a definition of the so called Non Verbal Syndrome will be presented.

Developmental medicine and child neurology	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2009.03272.x	AIM: Cognitive visual dysfunctions (CVDs) reflect an impairment of the capacity to process visual information. The question of whether CVDs might be classifiable  according to the nature and distribution of the underlying brain damage is an  intriguing one in child neuropsychology. METHOD: We studied 22 children born preterm  (12 males, 10 females; mean age at examination 8y, range 6-15y; mean gestational age  30wks, range 28-36wks) with periventricular leukomalacia, spastic diplegia, normal  intelligence (mean Full-scale IQ 84; mean Verbal IQ 97; mean Performance IQ 74), and  normal visual acuity, focusing on higher visual functions. Brain magnetic resonance  images (MRI) were analysed to establish the presence of lesions along the primary  optic pathway, in the occipitoparietal and occipitotemporal regions. RESULTS: Most  children displayed an uneven cognitive profile, with deficits in visual object  recognition, visual imagery, visual-spatial skills, and visual memory, and sparing  of visual associative abilities, non-verbal intelligence, and face and letter  recognition. Conventional brain MRI did not document major alterations of parietal  and temporal white matter, or cortical alteration of areas involved in visual  associative functions. INTERPRETATION: We suggest a widespread involvement of higher  visual processing systems, involving both the ventral and dorsal streams, in preterm  children with periventricular leukomalacia. The lack of major alterations on  conventional MRI does not exclude the possibility of malfunctioning of higher visual  processing systems, expressing itself through discrete CVDs. Possible mechanisms  underlying these neuropsychological deficits are discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

While a child with NLD may present similarly to a child with ADHD-PI, research suggests that the underlying deficits of attention problems in each disorder are different.  This study examines potential contributions of neuropsychological measures to differential diagnosis of NLD and ADHD-PI.  Participants included 214 children ages 6 to 12 years old with 17 meeting screening criteria for ADHD-PI and 20 for NLD.  Bootstrapped independent samples t-tests revealed significant differences between groups on neuropsychological measures that assess line orientation, recognition of part-whole relationships, and visual-spatial fluency.  Bootstrapped logistic regression revealed that visual-spatial and executive functioning measures predicted membership in the NLD group, while semantic and phonemic verbal fluency measures did not predict inclusion.  Findings suggest that executive dysfunction, especially as seen in executive tasks that also place demand on visual-spatial ability, may be an important component of the cognitive profile needed for an NLD diagnosis.  Neuropsychological measures that examine visual-spatial fluency, line orientation, and the recognition of part-whole relationships may be particularly helpful for differential diagnosis of NLD and ADHD-PI.

Researchers have identified learning disability subtypes and discovered a link between math-related learning difficulties and perceptual-motor, spatial and organizational deficits. Learning difficulties are typically not diagnosed until the middle primary grades following repeated academic failure, however clumsiness, which has also been linked to difficulties with academic learning, can often be detected earlier. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between motor proficiency and preacademic difficulties in the young child; specifically the relationship between early development of visual spatial skills, sequencing and arithmetic ability. Fifty children, ages 4 years 3 months to 5 years 8 months, were tested during two 30-40 minute sessions using: (1) the Miller Assessment for Preschoolers (MAP), a screening test designed to identify children at-risk for learning difficulties; (2) a pursuit tracking task (Buck, Leonardo & Hyde, 1981); (3) number/counting concept items (Miller, 1990). Subjects were divided into high and low performance groups based on total MAP score, specified MAP spatial items and number/counting concept items, and their performance on the pursuit tracking task examined.

We proposed a mediational path model in which we presumed that family literacy activities and parental encouragement of symbolic play acted as mediating variables, mediating the effect of parental education, family possessions and parent-to-child speech on child' language. The sample included 99 families with children, aged from 1 to 6 years. The data were collected in the family home, mostly via direct observation and by using a semi-structured interview with parents. The findings suggest that high-SES parents and parents who used a more complex and supportive speech, more frequently involved their children in different literacy activities. The effect of the parent-to-child speech on child's language proved to be mediated by parental use of mental transformations during symbolic play with a child. © Društvo psihologov Slovenije, ISSN 2350-5141.

Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS	https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617720001198	OBJECTIVES: Multiple studies have found evidence of task non-specific slow drift rate in ADHD, and slow drift rate has rapidly become one of the most visible  cognitive hallmarks of the disorder. In this study, we use the diffusion model to  determine whether atypicalities in visuospatial cognitive processing exist  independently of slow drift rate. METHODS: Eight- to twelve-year-old children with  (n = 207) and without ADHD (n = 99) completed a 144-trial mental rotation task.  RESULTS: Performance of children with ADHD was less accurate and more variable than  non-ADHD controls, but there were no group differences in mean response time. Drift  rate was slower, but nondecision time was faster for children with ADHD. A Rotation  × ADHD interaction for boundary separation was also found in which children with  ADHD did not strategically adjust their response thresholds to the same degree as  non-ADHD controls. However, the Rotation × ADHD interaction was not significant for  nondecision time, which would have been the primary indicator of a specific deficit  in mental rotation per se. CONCLUSIONS: Poorer performance on the mental rotation  task was due to slow rate of evidence accumulation, as well as relative  inflexibility in adjusting boundary separation, but not to impaired visuospatial  processing specifically. We discuss the implications of these findings for future  cognitive research in ADHD.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Success or failure experiences in early childhood on tasks requiring cognitive abilities could have a strong influence on an individual's educational and career choices. This thesis focuses on the role of cognitive functions.    In the first experiment, gender differences in performance on an ICT-relevant cognitive task---the Useful Field of View (UFOV) task---were discovered for the first time. The second experiment demonstrated that gender differences in UFOV may be reduced by training with action video games. Significant training benefits for women were also found on the Mental Rotation Test (MRT), which is another ICT-relevant cognitive task. Furthermore, attitudes toward ICT also became more positive after training.

The age groups used corresponded to the pre-operational and concrete operational Piagetian stages of cognitive development. In addition to completing a battery of tests measuring V-SA and VA, children undertook a wayfinding task in a forward and reverse direction. High V-SA children exhibited superior wayfinding skills to low V-SA children. In contrast, VA failed to influence wayfinding performance. Further analysis revealed that the effects of V-SA were only reliable in young children, suggesting that older children develop additional representational abilities that are neither visuo-spatial nor verbal in nature. Applications of these findings are discussed in terms of their implications for environmental design and planning. © 2000 Academic Press.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Compared to other cognitive functions, spatial orientation has been studied less in preschool ages. Some brain areas, such as the hippocampus and the temporal as well as the parietal and frontal cortices, are involved in spatial orientation. Therefore, when these brain regions are altered in neurological conditions or in atypical development in children, we would expect impairment of spatial abilities. The aim of this study is to review studies, published in recent years, that use egocentric and allocentric spatial orientation tasks for assessing spatial memory in preschool children, with the final goal of finding out which tests could be included in a clinical neuropsychological evaluation. We observed that although egocentric spatial orientation emerges first during development, allocentric spatial orientation tasks are employed at very early ages. Most of these tasks are performed in real environments, allowing children’s self-movements and using environmental modifications, but technologies such as virtual or augmented reality are increasingly used. Other aspects are discussed, such as the lack of consensus in the nomenclature, the difficulty of tracing the course of development of spatial orientation, or the ecological validity of the tests used. We finally observed that there is greater interest in studying the allocentric framework than the egocentric one, which makes it difficult to compare the use of the two frames of reference during a neuropsychological evaluation in preschool-aged children. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Applied neuropsychology. Child	https://doi.org/10.1080/21622965.2019.1709464	Preterm children with very low birth weight (<1,500 g) and extremely low birth weight (<1,000 g) have an increased risk of experiencing neuropsychological delays.  The purpose of this study is to characterize the neuropsychological profile of very  and extremely low birth weight preterm children and discover what maternal  conditions, diseases, procedures, and alterations in preterm newborns could be  related to their later neuropsychological development. Eighty-nine preterm children  (aged from 5 to 7 years) were assessed on their intelligence quotient (IQ),  executive function, memory, and visuospatial memory in a single session, using the  RIST and NEPSY-II test. Parents provided sociodemographic data. Preterm children  showed lower scores than normative values on impulsivity, visual short-term memory,  and spatial relation abilities. Extremely-low-birth weight preterm children also  showed less inhibitory control and worse mental rotation skills. Neonatal surgical  procedures, late-onset sepsis, and periventricular hemorrhages had the greatest  impact on neurodevelopment. When one or more of these conditions are present, memory  is the most affected neuropsychological function, followed by visuospatial skills,  inhibitory control, and IQ. It is important to take into account the presence of  maternal conditions, diseases, interventions, and neonatal alterations in preterm  newborns in order to determine the risk of neuropsychological delays in later  development.

Brain and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1532	INTRODUCTION: Spatial orientation relies mainly on two frameworks. The egocentric depends on our own position and point of view. The allocentric relies on  remembering, recalling, and recognizing environmental stimuli called landmarks. The  aim of this study was to analyze the egocentric and allocentric spatial memory  performance in children of different ages using two experimental memory card-placing  tasks. We also aimed to examine relationships between spatial memory and other  cognitive, physiological, and behavioral factors that, potentially, could be  associated with spatial memory performance. Those were other visuospatial functions,  the regular behavior of the child, cortisol levels, and daily life spatial memory.  METHODS: We assessed 62 children (5, 6, and 7 years) using card-placing tasks. We  used RIST for IQ evaluation and subtest from NEPSY-II for visuospatial ability  assessment. Collection of saliva sample was carried out for cortisol analysis.  Parents completed BASC questionnaire for behavioral evaluation and ECM-Q  questionnaire for daily life spatial memory evaluation. RESULTS: Our results showed  that older children performed better on mental rotation. Directionality, map  interpretation, and daily memory were directly associated with both egocentric and  allocentric orientation. Egocentric performance was positively related to leadership  abilities but negatively to depression and atypicality, while allocentric  performance was directly associated with adaptive behavior but inversely with  hyperactivity. Finally, cortisol values were positively associated with allocentric  performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows the development of different spatial  abilities between 5 and 7 years, as well as the relationship between orientation  performance, visuospatial skills, behavior, and cortisol.

Psychological research	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-018-1104-6	Research has shown that mental rotation (MR) can be improved through training. However, studies with preschool children are very scarce, due in part to the lack of  consensus as to the age at which this ability arises and can be trained, and due to  the difficulties of working on the understanding of this ability when it begins to  develop. The present study was designed to observe the effect of an MR training on  1st (3-4-year-old children) and 3rd year (5-6-year-old children) of Early Childhood  Education (preschool), as well as the development of this ability between both  courses. Finally, this study aimed to analyze the differential increase of the  training effect in relation to the initial MR ability of the participants. The  results showed a significant improvement in the participants who underwent training  in 3rd year of preschool, with the trained group showing a marginal improvement in  1st year of preschool. The older group showed lower error rates in training  performance than the younger group, the latter having a linear decrease in  performance as the angular disparity increased. In addition, in relation to  training, a greater increase of MR was observed in the 3rd year preschoolers with  lower scores in the pretest. These results suggest that MR is in full development  and that it is a spatial ability that can be trained at preschool ages. In addition,  the possibility of enhancing this ability to a greater extent in preschoolers who  exhibit lower initial MR level is especially relevant.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00753	Currently, there is evidence that spatial skills training leads to an improvement of such skills, although studies with children in the Preschool stage are very scarce.  This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of mental rotation (MR) training and  sex differences in preschool children. Two experiments were carried out. Experiment  1 included 59 children of 1st course (aged between 3 and 4 years) and Experiment 2,  61 children of 2nd course (aged between 4 and 5 years) of Preschool Education,  distributed into control and training groups. The results showed a significant  improvement in the MR ability of the training group (measured through a different  test than the one used for training) only in the older children, and a tendency  toward significance in the younger participants. Moreover, no sex differences in MR  or group differences across age groups were found. These results regarding MR  training support the malleability of spatial skills approach, particularly in 4-5  year-old preschoolers. This malleability should be enhanced in our educational  system, as well as the implementation of educational and social policies that tend  toward equality between sexes in the development of spatial skills. This can promote  an equitable access to academic careers requiring high spatial skills such as  engineering, science, technology or mathematics, in which nowadays women are  underrepresented.

PeerJ	https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10095	Several studies have tried to establish the factors that underlie mathematical ability across development. Among them, spatial and motor abilities might play a  relevant role, but no studies jointly contemplate both types of abilities to account  for mathematical performance. The present study was designed to observe the roles of  spatial and motor skills in mathematical performance. A total of 305 children aged  between 6 and 8 years took part in this study. A generalized linear regression model  with mathematical performance as a dependent variable was performed. Results  revealed that Block design (as a visuospatial reasoning measure) accounted for  mathematical performance, especially among 6- and 7-year-olds but not in  8-year-olds. After controlling for the effect of the block design, mental rotation  and manual dexterity predicted mathematical performance. These findings highlight  the role of underlying cognitive (spatial) and motor abilities in supporting  mathematical achievement in primary school children.

There is evidence that variations in the spatial language young children hear, which directs their attention to important aspects of the spatial environment, may be one of the mechanisms that contributes to these differences. To investigate how play affects variations in language, parents and children were assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: free play with blocks, guided play, or play with preassembled structures (Study 1). Parents in the guided play condition produced significantly higher proportions of spatial talk than parents in the other two conditions, and children in the guided play condition produced significantly more spatial talk than those in the free play condition. Study 2 established baselines of spatial language during activities not involving spatial materials. Proportions of spatial words were lower than those in any of the conditions of Experiment 1. In sum, interaction with blocks naturally elicits elevated levels of spatial language, especially in the context of guided play, suggesting simple-to-execute educational interventions. © 2011 The Authors.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.13067	The neural representation of visual-spatial functions has traditionally been ascribed to the right hemisphere, but little is known about these representations in  children, including whether and how lateralization of function changes over the  course of development. Some studies suggest bilateral activation early in life that  develops toward right-lateralization in adulthood, while others find evidence of  right-hemispheric dominance in both children and adults. We used a complex  visual-spatial construction task to examine the nature of lateralization and its  developmental time course in children ages 5-11 years. Participants were shown two  puzzle pieces and were asked whether the pieces could fit together to make a square;  responses required either mental translation of the pieces (Translation condition)  or both mental translation and rotation of the pieces (Rotation condition). Both  conditions were compared to a matched Luminance control condition that was similar  in terms of visual content and difficulty but required no spatial analysis. Group  and single-subject analyses revealed that the Rotation and Translation conditions  elicited strongly bilateral activation in the same parietal and occipital locations  as have been previously found for adults. These findings show that visual-spatial  construction consistently elicits robust bilateral activation from age 5 through  adulthood. This challenges the idea that spatial functions are all  right-lateralized, either during early development or in adulthood. More generally,  these findings provide insights into the developmental course of lateralization  across different spatial skills and how this may be influenced by the computational  requirements of the particular functions involved.

Children aged 5-11 years and a group of adults drew diamonds via information provided through a computer screen. The screen display was either upright or rotated 180°. Results showed that the absence of direct vision of the hand yielded more perturbation in the youngest group of children compared to all other groups. In spite of some initial difficulty, all children reached accurate control after five trials. When faced with spatial rotations of the visual field, youngsters were again more perturbed than others. All children showed the same rate of adaptation to visual rotations, but they differed on adaptive strategies. Five- and 7-year-olds shifted to a feedforward mode of control consisting of the production of a rapid gesture, followed by error evaluation in order to correct their next movement. Older children were characterised by a progressive integration of reafferent visual and proprioceptive information. It resulted in an increase in duration of strokes and reduced speed, meaning enhanced on-line retrieval of information. However, 9-year-old children experienced more difficulty recuperating sensory information during movement than 11-year-olds, and kept using error feedback. Finally, visuomanual coordination in children aged 11 years, while slightly differing from that of adults, was not yet totally mature.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Three groups of children (aged 6, 8 and 11 years) and a group of adults performed pointing movements without direct feedback from their arm displacements. Visual information, provided by a video camera, was disturbed by rotations of 0°, 45°, 90°, 135° or 180°. Six-year-old children showed poor accuracy for 180° rotations. These results suggest that the youngest children use unidirectional representations to convert visual information into motor sequences. At 8 years of age, children showed a shift from unidirectional to bidirectional representations, as reflected by reduced errors for 180° rotations. Eleven-year-old children and adults showed the same type of representations, i.e., bidirectional. However, as reflected by their slower movement time and slower modifications in temporal accuracy across trials, the oldest children have not yet reached maturation in their adaptive process when compared to adults.

Maps store spatial information and simplify navigation, computation, problem solving and critical thinking. Humans, even adults, face difficulties in using maps. Recent researchers, however claim that even pre-schoolers can develop space and map concepts using appropriate learning environments with the support of their teachers. Early spatial ability development has multiple benefits because it supports the construction of concepts in several other fields. With the spread of mobile devices, GPS and digital maps have become elements of the children's reality as tools for solving everyday problems. Considering the above facts, it makes reasonable that many organizations propose the age of 3-4 years for the introduction of maps. ICT can promote spatial ability, even for pre-schoolers, e.g. by LOGO programming or using GIS. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is not published research concerning location depended mobile games for the development of spatial ability of young children. The paper presents the experimental evaluation of a treasure hunt mobile game, designed for young children spatial ability development. The game uses a story as pretext for the hunting for a coin in the school's yard. During the hunting, the children solve 7 spatial ability puzzles/challenges, observing the physical space and following the audio recorded instructions. The children use the digital map and their GPS location trace to navigate from stop to stop. The results show that the game is engaging and supports the development of i) map reading, for orientation and navigation, and ii) fundamental spatial concepts (e.g. right and left) along with other concepts (e.g. number, colour, pattern). The research reveals also the mediating role of the teacher for the transformation of the personal meaning of the children's experience to formal knowledge. © The Authors, 2016. All Rights Reserved.

Four hypotheses regarding patterns of intellectual functioning and spatial ability were tested. A previous suggestion that the development of boyhood femininity is associated with higher than average IQ was not supported, since the IQs of the feminine boys and their brothers did not differ. A report of enhanced verbal ability as compared with perceptual organization also was not replicated in these feminine boys. On Kaufman's 'Freedom from Distractibility' factor, the feminine boys and their brothers obtained scores as low as the psychiatric controls; that is, all three groups were equally distractible. It was suggested that anxiety contributed to poor performance on this factor. Unlike the control groups, the feminine boys obtained low scores on a test of spatial ability (Block Design) as compared to their scores on a verbal task (Vocabulary). The association between a feminine gender role and relatively poor spatial ability was discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

It has been found that both children and adults with visual impairments can struggle with complex spatial tasks that require a metric representation of space. Nonetheless the variability of methods employed to assess spatial abilities in absence of vision is wide, especially in the case of visually impaired children. For this reason, it would be necessary to define a battery of tests that appropriately assess different aspects of spatial perception and to investigate its reliability in order to provide a standard assessment of spatial abilities not only in experimental but also in clinical settings. The aim of this study is to determine the test–retest reliability of a battery of six spatial tasks (BSP, Blind Spatial Perception) and provide the first gold standard for assessing spatial cognition deficits in visually impaired children. Thirty visually impaired children aged 6–17 participated in two identical sessions, at a distance of 10 weeks, in which they performed six spatial tasks: auditory bisection, auditory localization, auditory distance discrimination, auditory reaching, proprioceptive reaching, and general mobility. Test–retest reliability was assessed using the test-retest scatter plots, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), and coefficient of variation (CV). The results showed good-to-excellent reliability for all six tests, with average ICC values ranging from 0.77 to 0.89 and average CV values ranging from 3.44% to 15.27%. In conclusion, the newly proposed battery (BSP) results as a reliable tool to identify spatial impairments in visually impaired children. © 2019 Finocchietti et al.

Annu. Int. Conf. IEEE Eng. Med. Biol. Soc. EMBS	https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320248	This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of the Audio Bracelet for Blind Interaction (ABBI) system for improving mobility and spatial cognition in visually impaired children. The bracelet is worn on the wrist and the key feature is to provide an audio feedback about body movements to help visually impaired children to build a sense of space. Nine early blind children took part at this study. The study lasted 12 weeks. Once per week each child participated in a 45-minutes ABBI rehabilitation with trained professionals. He also had to use it one hour per day at home alone or with one relative. The mobility and spatial cognition abilities were measured before and after a 12-weeks rehabilitation program with three different tests. Results showed that the use of the Audio Bracelet for Blind Interaction allowed the early blind children to significantly improve their mobility and spatial abilities. Although an extended study including a larger number of participants is needed to confirm these data, the present results are encouraging. They do suggest that ABBI could be used for rehabilitate the sense of space in visually impaired children. © 2015 IEEE.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Due to the reduced penetrance, many mutation carriers remain clinically asymptomatic, despite the presence of subclinical abnormalities, mainly in the motor control circuitry. Our aim was to investigate whether the DYT1 mutation impairs the inner simulation of movements, a fundamental function for motor planning and execution, which relies upon cortical and subcortical systems, dysfunctional in dystonia. Methods: DYT1 manifesting patients, DYT1 non-manifesting carriers and control subjects were asked to fixate body (hand, foot, face) or non-body (car) stimuli on a computer screen. Stimuli were presented at different degrees of orientations and subjects had to mentally rotate them, in order to give a laterality judgement. Reaction times and accuracy were collected. Results: DYT1 carriers, manifesting and non-manifesting dystonic symptoms, were slower in mentally rotating body parts (but not cars) than control subjects. Conclusions: The DYT1 gene mutation is associated with a slowness in mental simulation of movements, independently from the presence of motor symptoms. Significance: These findings suggest that the cognitive representation of body movements may be altered subclinically in dystonia, thus contributing to the endophenotypic trait of disease. © 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

Meanwhile, cognitive impairments in this area are required to be widely studied. This study aimed at using Computerized Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised (CACE-R) as an effective and new neurocognitive monitoring tool to diagnose children with benign brain tumors (BBT) and malignant brain tumors (MBT) after surgery. Materials and Methods: In the present causal-comparative study, 83 children aged 10 to 14 years old with BBT and MBT, who were treated in Mahak (a pediatric oncology support center in Tehran, Iran) during 6 months, participated. They underwent surgery and fractionated radiotherapy (at a dose of 53 Gy). After meeting the inclusion criteria, they were evaluated by a computerized version of ACE-R. Results: In this study, 33.33% of children with MBT vs 28.89% of BBT used shunts and 28.89% of them experienced relapse and 22.82% dropped out of school. About 17.77% of mothers were not graduated from high school. These factors predicted the memory, fluency, and language of these children. Furthermore, the results of this study showed a significant difference between children with BBT and MBT in terms of attention/orientation, memory, fluency, language, and visual-spatial abilities in ACE-R (P<0.001). Conclusion: Children with BBT compared with those with MBT experienced more problems in attentionorientation function, short-and long-term memory, fluency, language, and spatial-visual ability. These results emphasized that only leisure induced by tumor growth did not cause cognitive impairment, but the nature and function of the tumor also contribute to damage of the brain activity. © Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences 2020, by the authors.

On each of 40 trials, after exploring a randomly generated nonsense form using only finger motion, Ss judged a tactually presented comparison form as either the same as or different from the 1st stimulus. In Condition 1, a single stimulus form and the comparison form were successively presented to the same hand. In Condition 2, stimulus forms were simultaneously presented to both hands; however, a comparison form was presented to only one hand. Results indicate that the left hand (right hemisphere) was more accurate than the right hand (left hemisphere) for 5th-grade Ss and adults, but no significant differences between hands were found for 1st- and 3rd-grade Ss. Overall, Condition 2 was more difficult than Condition 1, but similar laterality effects were found in both groups. Sex differences were found only in the adult group in which males made somewhat fewer errors than females.

Journal of school psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsp.2014.10.002	Although the effect of stereotype threat concerning women and mathematics has been subject to various systematic reviews, none of them have been performed on the  sub-population of children and adolescents. In this meta-analysis we estimated the  effects of stereotype threat on performance of girls on math, science and spatial  skills (MSSS) tests. Moreover, we studied publication bias and four moderators: test  difficulty, presence of boys, gender equality within countries, and the type of  control group that was used in the studies. We selected study samples when the study  included girls, samples had a mean age below 18years, the design was  (quasi-)experimental, the stereotype threat manipulation was administered  between-subjects, and the dependent variable was a MSSS test related to a gender  stereotype favoring boys. To analyze the 47 effect sizes, we used random effects and  mixed effects models. The estimated mean effect size equaled -0.22 and significantly  differed from 0. None of the moderator variables was significant; however, there  were several signs for the presence of publication bias. We conclude that  publication bias might seriously distort the literature on the effects of stereotype  threat among schoolgirls. We propose a large replication study to provide a less  biased effect size estimate.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Developmental medicine and child neurology	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8749.1989.tb03981.x	Two studies investigated the construct validity of Boder's classification of dyslexic children, using spectral analysis of electroencephalograms recorded during  cognitive tasks. Children were classified as being dysphonetic (auditory-phonetic  disabilities), dyseidetic (visual spatial disabilities) or mixed (deficient in both  processes). The first study examined 21 dyslexic children between seven and 10 years  of age and six control children. On three of six cognitive tasks there were  significant differences between the dyslexic subgroups, and between the dyslexic and  control children. The second study involved 33 eight- and nine-year-old dyslexic  children and 31 controls. The results of two of seven cognitive tasks confirmed  subtype differences. Significant differences in left temporal-parietal theta  activity in the electroencephalograms of the dyseidetic children suggest that their  reading disabilities may be the result of over-use of linguistic abilities rather  than deficient visual-spatial skills.

Internal consistencies are high for all measures except Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and Delayed Picture Memory. Two-month, test-retest reliabilities are also reported. The twin sample is representative in terms of both means and variances when compared to normative data from standardization samples, and twin correlations for height and weight are similar to those obtained in six other twin studies. Because all measures were highly correlated with age (average correlation with age was 0.64), scores were age adjusted. Previous twin studies of specific cognitive abilities in adolescents and adults found genetic variance for nearly all tests. In contrast, our study of young twins yielded significant genetic influence for only 1 of the 11 measures, PIAT Reading Recognition, and suggested the possibility of genetic influence on 2 others (vocabulary and WISC-R mazes). Environmental influences seem to dominate, particularly for nonverbal measures, as children begin their education. In accord with other studies, we found that between-family environmental factors have an important influence on the development of nearly all of the measures of specific cognitive abilities. However, we found that our tests of perceptual speed and memory were substantially influenced by within-family environmental factors independent of error. © 1980 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Children (N = 78; Age M = 9.36) completed assessments of VSM, arithmetic strategies, and arithmetic accuracy. Consistent with previous findings, VSM predicted arithmetic accuracy in children. Extending previous findings, the current study showed that the relation between VSM and arithmetic performance was mediated by the frequency of children's use of decomposition strategies. Identifying the role of arithmetic strategies in this relation has implications for increasing the math performance of children with lower VSM. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The link between children's visuospatial working memory and arithmetic accuracy is well documented. Frequency of decomposition strategy use is positively related to children's arithmetic accuracy. Children's spatial skill positively predicts the frequency with which they use decomposition. What does this study add? Short-term visuospatial memory (VSM) positively relates to the frequency of children's decomposition use. Decomposition use mediates the relation between short-term VSM and arithmetic accuracy. Children with limited short-term VSM may struggle to use decomposition, decreasing accuracy. © 2016 The British Psychological Society	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Scientific reports	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74886-0	The cross-sex shift hypothesis predicts that gay men should perform more like heterosexual women on important neurocognitive tasks on which men score higher than  women, such as mental rotation. Studies also suggest sex differences exist in the  neural correlates of mental rotation. However, no studies have taken sexual  orientation into account or considered within-group variation attributable to  recalled gender nonconformity (a developmental trait reliably associated with human  nonheterosexuality). We quantified the neural correlates of mental rotation by  comparing two groups of gay men, gender conforming (n = 23) and gender nonconforming  (n = 23), to gender conforming heterosexual men (n = 22) and women (n = 22). We  observed a sex difference between heterosexual men and women in the premotor  cortex/supplementary motor cortex and left medial superior frontal gyrus. We also  observed a sex difference as well as a cross-sex shift in gay men who recalled being  gender nonconforming as children in the right superior frontal gyrus, right angular  gyrus, right amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus, and bilaterally in the middle temporal  gyrus and precuneus. Thus, cross-sex shifts may be associated with underlying  developmental factors which are associated with sexual orientation (such as gender  nonconformity). The results also suggest that gay men should not be studied as a  homogenous group.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Psychoneuroendocrinology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2016.07.222	Cranial radiotherapy is a known risk factor for neurocognitive impairment in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Understanding the nature  of cognitive dysfunction during adulthood in ALL survivors is important as it has an  impact on major life situations. Thirty-eight (21 women) ALL survivors were  investigated 34 years after diagnosis. Median-age was 38 (27-46) years. All were  treated with a CRT dose of 24Gy and 11 years (3-13) of complete hormone  supplementation. Comparisons were made to 29 matched controls. Assessments of  magnetic resonance spectroscopy (white and grey matter metabolic alterations), brain  volume and neuropsychological tests were performed. ALL survivors demonstrate a  generally lower performance in neuropsychological tests. ALL survivors scored lower  than controls in vocabulary (p<0.001), memory (p<0.001), learning capacity  (p<0.001), spatial ability (p<0.001), executive functions and attention (p<0.001) 34  years after ALL treatment. Compared to controls ALL survivors had reduced white  matter (WM) (492 vs 536cm(3), p<0.001) and grey matter (GM) volumes (525 vs  555cm(3), p=0.001). ALL survivors had lower levels of WM N-acetyl aspartate/creatin  (NAA/Cr) (1.48 vs 1.63, p=0.004), WM NAA+NAAG (N-acetylaspartylglutamate)/Cr (1.61  vs 1.85, p<0.001) and lower levels of GM NAA/Cr (1.18 vs 1.30, p=0.001) and GM  NAA+NAAG/Cr (1.28 vs 1.34, p=0.01) compared to controls. ALL survivors had higher  levels in WM MI (Myoinositol)/NAA (0.65 vs 0.56, p=0.01) concentrations compared to  controls. There was a significantly negative correlation of years since ALL  diagnosis to WM NAA+NAAG/Cr (r=-0.4, p=0.04) in ALL survivors. The present study  shows impaired brain metabolism detected by MRS, reduced brain volumes and  neurocognitive impairment in childhood ALL survivors treated with cranial  radiotherapy and chemotherapy, despite complete hormone substitution. We also report  an impairment of metabolites correlated to time since treatment and a progressive  impairment in sustained attention, suggesting an accelerated aging in the irradiated  brain. Following these survivors many decades, or throughout life, after treatment  with cranial radiotherapy and chemotherapy is highly warranted for a broader  understanding of long-term outcome in this patient group.

Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)	https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186X.2019.1571279	Background: Cranial radiotherapy (CRT) is a known risk factor for neurocognitive impairment in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Diffusion  tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) are MRI techniques that  quantify microstructural changes in brain white matter (WM) and DKI is regarded as  the more sensitive of them. Our aim was to more thoroughly understand the nature of  cognitive deficits after cranial radiotherapy (CRT) in adulthood after childhood  ALL. Material and methods: Thirty-eight (21 women) ALL survivors, median age 38  (27-46) years, were investigated at median 34 years after diagnosis. All had been  treated with a CRT dose of 24 Gy and with 11 years of complete hormone  supplementation. DTI and DKI parameters were determined and neurocognitive tests  were performed in ALL survivors and 29 matched controls. Results: ALL survivors  scored lower than controls in neurocognitive tests of vocabulary, memory, learning  capacity, spatial ability, executive functions, and attention (p < .001). The  survivors had altered DTI parameters in the fornix, uncinate fasciculus, and ventral  cingulum (all p < .05) and altered DKI parameters in the fornix, uncinate  fasciculus, and dorsal and ventral cingulum (p < .05). Altered DTI parameters in the  fornix were associated with impaired episodic verbal memory (r = -0.40, p < .04).  The left and right uncinate fasciculus (r = 0.6, p < .001), (r = -0.5, p < .02) as  well as the right ventral cingulum (r = 0.5, p < .007) were associated with impaired  episodic visual memory. Altered DKI parameters in the fornix, right uncinate  fasciculus (r = 0.3, r = 0.05, p = .02), and ventral cingulum (r = 0.3, p = .02)  were associated with impaired results of episodic visual memory. Conclusion: ALL  survivors with cognitive deficits demonstrated microstructural damage in several WM  tracts that were more extensive with DKI as compared to DTI; this might be a marker  of radiation and chemotherapy neurotoxicity underlying cognitive dysfunction.

Effectiveness of training in visual animation/construction or in verbal labeling was also considered. Prior to training, the 209 Japanese and American 7-, 10-, and 13-year-olds completed the Raven's Progressive Matrices and tests of perceptual reasoning and spatial relations. No outstanding differences were apparent. However, on the test of 108 figural matrices, speed/accuracy trade-off decisions differed for the two cultures. In contrast to American children, Japanese children's error decrease was accompanied by relatively little latency increase between the ages of 7and 10. This finding is attributed to Japanese children's expeditious style of considering task-related information. Moreover, this Japanese style appears to temper traditional gender differences in effectiveness of visual versus verbal training and in encoding spatial rotations. © 1989, Sage Publications.

Behavioural brain research	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0166-4328(00)00159-5	The Kiel locomotor maze requires participants to choose five targets from among 20 locations marked by small red lights on the floor of a dimly lit circular  environment having four wall-mounted extramaze cues and two intramaze cues at floor  level. In the present study, acquisition of the real task was examined in  11-year-old children following prior accurate training in a virtual version,  following misleading virtual training, or following no training. The virtual version  was displayed on a desk-top computer monitor. Acquisition testing in the real maze  was either locomotor or non-locomotor. Good transfer was achieved from virtual to  real versions. Children's exploration of the real maze prior to real maze  acquisition training revealed a clear transfer of spatial information previously  learned in the virtual version. Children taught the correct target configuration in  the simulation made fewer errors and more rapid, confident responses to targets in  the real maze than children given no training. However, acquisition was also better  following misleading training than no training, suggesting that a non-specific  components of performance also transferred. Male superiority was only seen following  misleading training, which was interpreted in terms of male superiority in mental  rotation. After acquisition, a single probe trial was performed, in which proximal  cues and participants' starting position were rotated, but this had equivalent  effects on all groups' performance. It is clear that transfer of spatial information  occurs from the simulated Kiel maze to the real version. This has implications for  its use in diagnosis and training.

PloS one	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003566	BACKGROUND: In this study we investigated the association between instrumental music training in childhood and outcomes closely related to music training as well as  those more distantly related. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Children who received  at least three years (M = 4.6 years) of instrumental music training outperformed  their control counterparts on two outcomes closely related to music (auditory  discrimination abilities and fine motor skills) and on two outcomes distantly  related to music (vocabulary and nonverbal reasoning skills). Duration of training  also predicted these outcomes. Contrary to previous research, instrumental music  training was not associated with heightened spatial skills, phonemic awareness, or  mathematical abilities. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While these results are  correlational only, the strong predictive effect of training duration suggests that  instrumental music training may enhance auditory discrimination, fine motor skills,  vocabulary, and nonverbal reasoning. Alternative explanations for these results are  discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

It has become usual practice to dichotomise water-level responses by the subjects into right vs wrong using a certain tolerance limit (departure from the horizontal measured in degrees) and to fit a mixture of binomials to the raw scores resulting from a series of water-level tasks. The present study questions this procedure. Based on a series of 12 water-level tasks (round bottles at 12 different angles of orientation) presented to 431 subjects, both children and adults, females and males, the following results were obtained. First, considering the task difficulties (proportions of correct answers) and the scores, the effect of age was significant, but that for sex was not. Second, a mixture of binomials were shown to be inappropriate due to their ignoring the heterogeneity of the task difficulties, whereas latent class models, due to their taking this heterogeneity as well as that of the subjects into account, were successful in rendering a complete and well-rounded description of the data as observed for the eight water-level tasks showing bottles with orientations corresponding to 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 o'clock. Third, the Rasch model was valid as justification for the simple interpretation that subjects and tasks have a unidimensional scale in common with each other and that the raw score is the sufficient statistic for the subjects' performance. Fourth, employing the linear logistic test model, the task difficulty parameters according to the Rasch model could be attributed to a single parameter associated with the angle of inclination of the bottle. In all, the results do not give a final answer to the question of whether the concept of types (classes) or that of a continuous trait is the better of the two, but they do give rise to some warnings against the use of a mixture of binomials for modeling data on water-level tasks.

We trained PWS individuals with the deletion subtype in two different RAM paradigms that tapped different aspects of spatial memory. To evaluate the extent of spatial deficit in PWS individuals, it seemed interesting to compare their performances with those of individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) in which deficits in spatial abilities have been well described. The two syndromic groups were compared to typically developing (TD) individuals mental-age and gender matched. The findings evidenced the impairment of PWS individuals in solving the RAM task with variable severity depending on the paradigm requests. Since the RAM is a task that allows the acquisition of spatial competences through the movement, we advance that the spatial deficits observed in PWS individuals may be related to the malfunctioning of spatial and motor integrative processing. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

In the present spatial task, WS participants had to explore an open space to search nine rewards placed in buckets arranged according to three spatial configurations: a cross, a 3 × 3 matrix and a cluster composed by three groups of three buckets each. The findings demonstrate that WS individuals were impaired in efficiently exploring the environment and in building cognitive spatial maps. In exploring the three spatial configurations, they performed worse than control subjects on all parameters analyzed. In fact, WS individuals took more time to complete the task, made more errors, performed a reduced number of error-free trials, displayed lower search efficiency, exhibited shorter spatial spans, showed a higher number of no-visits and displayed marked tendencies to perseverate and to neglect some buckets. Furthermore, WS individuals showed disorganized explorative patterns in comparison to control children. WS influenced performances differentially as a specific effect of the susceptibility of the configurations to being explored in a principled way. In the cross configuration that had strong spatial constraints, both groups exhibited their worst performances. In the matrix configuration, the altered explorative strategies of the WS subjects primarily affected their central exploration. The performances in the cluster configuration indicated that chunking was a strategy of strength in both TD and WS groups. In conclusion, WS individuals' deficits exhibited in the present explorative test may be considered an index of their difficulties in spatial orientation and motion perception displayed in the real world. The marked impairment in spatial information processing is discussed in neuro-anatomical alterations reported in WS. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00287	Williams syndrome (WS) is associated with a distinct profile of relatively proficient skills within the verbal domain compared to the severe impairment of  visuo-spatial processing. Abnormalities in executive functions and deficits in  planning ability and spatial working memory have been described. However, to date  little is known about the influence of executive function deficits on navigational  abilities in WS. This study aimed at analyzing in WS individuals a specific  executive function, the backward inhibition (BI) that allows individuals to flexibly  adapt to continuously changing environments. A group of WS individuals and a mental  age- and gender-matched group of typically developing children were subjected to  three task-switching experiments requiring visuospatial or verbal material to be  processed. Results showed that WS individuals exhibited clear BI deficits during  visuospatial task-switching paradigms and normal BI effect during verbal  task-switching paradigm. Overall, the present results suggest that the BI  involvement in updating environment representations during navigation may influence  WS navigational abilities.

In this evaluation, primary emphasis was placed on the role of metacognitive factors in precipitating emergence of map reading skills and in allowing for their successful expression.    Each child was randomly assigned to one of four map design conditions. During pretraining, each child's knowledge of map conventions and usage was assessed. During the experimental task, where and how often children referred back to the map for guidance and contingent route traversal success was measured. All experimental sessions were videotaped.    Four, five and six year old children came into the experimental situation with different levels of map-related knowledge. All groups demonstrated improvement in these skills after training. However, knowing about maps was not shown to covary with knowing how to use them during the experimental task.    As anticipated, older children were able to reach map-designated goals with less difficulty than younger children. Even for the oldest children map design was critical. Mimetic maps resulted in better performance than alternative itinerary maps. An additional finding was that girls appeared to lag a year behind the boys they were compared to.    Supplementary analyses indicated that map use by fours was rare. Fives were willing to try to rely on a map for guidance but experienced difficulty in converting map referral into errorfree route traversal. Sixes were both more strategic than fives in deciding when to rely on the provided map and better able to consistently convert reliance into correct route traversal choices. Although six year old performance was relatively more sophisticated than that of the younger groups, six year olds demonstrated considerable difficulty in utilizing a map as a tool for reorienting after error.    This study provides evidence that during the four to six year old period, young children are developing the metacognitive, spatial ability, and symbolic interpretation skills necessary for map reading.

The variables scaled are: for SP, spatial manipulation experience, miscellaneous spatial experience, and parental encouragement of independence; for PSA, visual detail experience; for VF, verbal expression experience; for VC, language learning experience and parental encouragement of school achievement; and, for artistic interest, artistic experience. The types of experiences scaled are childhood activities, parental encouragements, parental modeling, and childhood materials. Scales are scored from both self- and parent-report versions of the ELEQ.    A sample of 248 Minnesota high school students was used to collect criterion-related validity data on the ELEQ scales; small supplemental samples of students and parents were used to collect test-retest reliability data.    Overall, the study results show the ELEQ scales to have: fairly high test-retest reliability; moderate interrater reliability; patterns of interrelationships, sex differences and relationships to socioeconomic status that are consistent with findings in the broader literature; and, stronger relationships to the criterion attributes than those produced by SES measures. Moreover, the hypothesized differential criterion-relationships were clearly evidenced by the spatial manipulation, language learning, and artistic experience variables, and partially evidenced by the parental encouragement of independence and school achievement variables. Conversely, the hypothesized criterion-relationships for the visual detail, miscellaneous spatial, and verbal expression experience variables were supported.    When the different types of experiences contributing to each variable were scaled separately, childhood activity and parental encouragement scales consistently emerged as having greater criterion-related validity than childhood materials and parental modeling scales. Additionally, childhood activities emerged as the scales with the lowest relationship to SES, and the greatest likelihood of showing sex differences.

Games-based Learn.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84996993132&partnerID=40&md5=a694312fbfa2a8426588e955b0adf50f	In the "A me gli occhi" project, a virtual reality game addressing spatial perspective taking is used with a group of primary school children (ages 8-10) with the aim of supporting the development of visual thinking. Several studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between spatial reasoning and success in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Visual thinking skills predict a young person's achievement in STEM areas; people with good spatial abilities are more likely to engage in STEM studies and later in STEM related jobs. There are great differences among people in spatial reasoning abilities; nevertheless, they can be trained with long lasting improvements affecting STEM results. An intervention to increase spatial abilities at an early age may have positive effects on the person's future. We have developed a virtual reality game specifically designed to make the player feel as if the virtual world were real, with a special attention to its usability for all, including children with mild intellectual disabilities. The game is available in three different levels of immersion. The first phase of the project focused on the identification of the optimal level of immersion for the task and the definition of the best age group to be addressed. In the second phase, which is ongoing, the children, divided into balanced teams, will participate to a tournament using the same game. Specific moments when the stronger members of the team will teach the weaker ones will be organized. At the end of the experimental period, students' ability in spatial perspective taking will be measured again. Data will be correlated to their abilities with respect to STEM subjects and improvements will be compared to those of students who have not taken part to the training phase of the project. © The Authors, 2016.

The authors surveyed 25 children's story-books, ranging in reading level from pre-school to grade four, for the kinds of locatives (spatial concepts) used to communicate, and the kinds of spaces used to illustrate, each locative. Results suggest that story-books for children reflect Bracken's developmental progression as to locative terms in story-books for children of different ages. Results also suggest prototype locatives (which are a basic subset of locatives that can be used to communicate spatial relationships) in the development of spatial image schemata. Lastly, results indicate an absence of references to geographic spaces. Recommendations are made that encourage the creation of children's story-books strong in geographical content.

It allows for assessment of mental rotation abilities in children younger than 5 years, using a task comparable to ones used with older children and adults. Children saw pairs of asymmetrical ghost figures, either as three-dimensional cut-outs or two-dimensional paper versions, in seven orientations. One of the ghosts fit into a hole if rotated right-side up - the other ghost was its mirror image and would not fit. Children were asked to turn the ghosts in their heads and choose the one that would fit into the hole. The number of children who chose the correct ghost above chance in the three-dimensional version of the task increased dramatically from 10% of 3-year-olds to 95% of 5-year-olds; average accuracy also increased significantly, from 54% to 83%. The two-dimensional paper version yielded similar results. These results indicate considerable development in mental rotation between 3 and 5 years. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To address this gap, we created scenes of toy photographers taking pictures of layouts of objects from different angles, and presented them to 4- to 8-year-olds (N = 80). Children were asked to choose which one of four pictures could have been taken from a specific viewpoint. Results showed that this new technique confirmed the classic pattern of developmental progress on this kind of spatial skill: (1) 4-year-olds responded near chance level, regardless of layout complexity, (2) there was a growing ability to inhibit egocentric choices around age 6 with layouts of low complexity (one object), (3) performance increased and egocentric responses decreased dramatically around age 7, (4) even at age 8, children still showed considerable individual variability. This perspective taking task can thus be used to address important questions about the supports for early spatial development and the structure of early intellect. © 2014 Frick, Möhring and Newcombe.

A toy on a turntable was fully covered and then rotated 90°. When revealed, the toy had turned with the turntable (probable event), remained at its starting orientation (improbable event in Experiment 1), or turned to the opposite side (improbable event in Experiment 2). Results demonstrated a developmental progression between 14 and 16 months of age in infants' sensitivity to spatial object relations and their ability to track the orientation of an object during hidden rotation. Experiment 3 showed that 14-month-olds' performance improved with hands-on training, highlighting the role of action experience in cognitive development. © 2013 Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

Psychological research	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-018-1008-5	Using a longitudinal approach, this study investigated the relational structure of different spatial transformation skills at kindergarten age, and how these spatial  skills relate to children's later mathematics performance. Children were tested at  three time points, in kindergarten, first grade, and second grade (N = 119).  Exploratory factor analyses revealed two subcomponents of spatial transformation  skills: one representing egocentric transformations (mental rotation and spatial  scaling), and one representing allocentric transformations (e.g., cross-sectioning,  perspective taking). Structural equation modeling suggested that egocentric  transformation skills showed their strongest relation to the part of the mathematics  test tapping arithmetic operations, whereas allocentric transformations were  strongly related to Numeric-Logical and Spatial Functions as well as geometry. The  present findings point to a tight connection between early mental transformation  skills, particularly the ones requiring a high level of spatial flexibility and a  strong sense for spatial magnitudes, and children's mathematics performance at the  beginning of their school career.

Psychological research	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-016-0785-y	Developmental research on spatial perspective taking has shown that young children are able to solve perspective-taking problems under favorable circumstances, but  they have difficulties succeeding in classic tasks involving a conflict between  one's own perspective and that of another observer. To date, little is known about  the reasons for young children's difficulties in dealing with incongruent  perspectives. Based on the assumption that one's own perspective has to be ignored  to imagine someone else's perspective, it was investigated whether perspective  taking is related to inhibitory control in 6-year-olds (N = 140). An adapted version  of the 'Fruit Stroop task', appropriate for preschool children, was used to assess  inhibitory control. Perspective taking was assessed using the 'Perspective-Taking  Test for Children'. Other spatial and nonspatial abilities were assessed to  investigate the specificity of the relation. Results showed a significant  correlation between perspective taking and inhibitory control, even when controlled  for age, verbal-IQ, and socio-economic status. However, no significant correlations  between inhibition and other spatial abilities were found, indicating a specific  relation between inhibition and perspective taking. A linear regression analysis  showed that, even after accounting for effects of control variables as well as other  mental transformation abilities, inhibition accounted for a significant part of the  variance in perspective-taking performance. The present findings provide valuable  information on what contributes to individual differences in perspective taking,  which is an important aspect of everyday cognition and bears relevance for reasoning  in technical domains.

In this study, we investigated the influence of a rotational hand movement on mental rotation performance from a developmental perspective. Children at the age of 5, 8, and 11 years and adults performed a mental rotation task while simultaneously rotating their hand (guided by a handle). The direction of the manual rotation was either compatible or incompatible with the direction of the mental rotation. Response times increased with increasing stimulus orientation angles, indicating that participants of all age groups used mental rotation to perform the task. A differential effect of the compatibility of manual rotation and mental rotation was found for 5-year-olds and 8-year-olds, but not for 11-year-olds and adults. The results of this study suggest that the ability to dissociate motor from visual cognitive processes increases with age.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Cognitive processing	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-012-0534-0	Mental rotation is an important spatial skill. However, there is controversy concerning its early development and susceptibility to intervention. In the present  study, we assessed individual differences in the mental rotation abilities of  children between 3½ and 5½ years of age, using a touch screen paradigm to simplify  task demands. A figure or its mirror image was presented in 8 different  orientations, and children indicated in which of two holes the figure would fit by  touching one of the holes on the screen. Task instructions were varied in three  conditions, giving the children the opportunity to gather manual or observational  experience with rotations of different stimuli, or giving no additional experience.  Children's error rates and response times increased linearly with increasing angular  disparity between the figure and the hole by the age of 5 years, but 4-year-olds  were found to respond at chance for all angular disparities, despite the use of a  touch screen paradigm. Both manual and observational experience increased the  response accuracy of 5-year-olds, especially for children already performing well.  However, there was no effect on 4-year-olds. Results point to an emerging readiness  to use mental rotation and profit from observational and manual experience at age 5.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2013.04.001	Recent evidence indicates that 6-month-old infants' mental rotation of objects profits from prior manual experience, whereas observational experience does not have  the same beneficial effect. The current study investigated whether older infants, at  8 and 10 months, succeed in a mental rotation task after observational experience  only and whether performance is related to infants' motor development. Using the  violation-of-expectation paradigm, infants (N = 40) were presented with an  asymmetrical object that was moved straight down behind an occluder. After the  occluder was lowered, infants saw either the original object (possible event) or a  mirror image of the original object (impossible event) in one of five different  orientations (0° to 180° in steps of 45°). Results indicated that it was not until  10 months of age that infants looked longer at the impossible outcome. Analyses  including parent questionnaire data showed that mental rotation performance was  related to infants' motor development, emphasizing the importance of action  experience for early cognitive development.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.02049	Recent research has shown close links between spatial and mathematical thinking and between spatial abilities and motor skills. However, longitudinal research examining  the relations between motor, spatial, and mathematical skills is rare, and the  nature of these relations remains unclear. The present study thus investigated the  relation between children's motor control and their spatial and proportional  reasoning. We measured 6-year-olds' spatial scaling (i.e., the ability to reason  about different-sized spaces), their mental transformation skills, and their ability  to balance on one leg as an index for motor control. One year later (N = 126), we  tested the same children's understanding of proportions. We also assessed several  control variables (verbal IQ and socio-economic status) as well as inhibitory  control, visuo-spatial and verbal working memory. Stepwise hierarchical regressions  showed that, after accounting for effects of control variables, children's balance  skills significantly increased the explained variance in their spatial performance  and proportional reasoning. Our results suggest specific relations between balance  skills and spatial as well as proportional reasoning skills that cannot be explained  by general differences in executive functioning or intelligence.

Trends in cognitive sciences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2014.05.011	Mental representation and transformation of spatial information is often examined with mental rotation (MR) tasks, which require deciding whether a rotated image is  the same as or the mirror version of an upright image. Recent research with infants  shows early discrimination of objects from mirror-image versions. However, even at  the age of 4 years, many children perform at near chance level on more standard  measures. Similar age discrepancies can be observed in other domains, including  perspective taking, theory of mind, and intuitive physics. These paradoxical results  raise the questions of how performance relates to competence and how to  conceptualize developmental change. There may be a common underlying mechanism: the  development of the ability to imagine things and mentally transform them in a  prospective fashion.

The high spatial ability of these young chess players  suggested by the high performance IQs may go some way towards explaining why males  tend to be more numerous than females among high-standard chess players.

In contrast, the activational effect of hormones (i.e., the effect of current hormone levels) on cognitive performance during later life remains controversial This study examined the effects of androgens on cognitive functioning in women. Women with hyperandrogenism, a hormonal disorder starting during late childhood or adolescence, were compared to women with normal hormone levels in five areas of cognitive functioning: spatial ability, verbal fluency, perceptual speed and accuracy, attentIon, and verbal and nonverbal memory.    Twenty-three women with hyperandrogenism were compared to 24 age, education, SES, and IQ matched control women. Groups did not differ in their general ability in the five cognitive areas examined. However, significant negative correlations were noted between free testosterone levels and verbal fluency, attention and perceptual speed and accuracy. In contrast to expectations, free testosterone levels were also negatively correlated with spatial ability. This may have been the result of reduced spatial experience in women with hyperandrogenism, which, in part, appeared to be due to increased weight. The results suggest that free testosterone levels have a small influence on cognitive functioning in women and offer modest support to the hypothesis that hormones have an activational effect on brain functioning.

Moreover, MI seems to rely on a network involving motor related regions including fronto-parietal areas and subcortical structures, supporting the view that MI and motor execution are very similar processes (Hétu et al., 2013). This ability has been shown to emerge between 5 and 7 years of age and improve during childhood and adolescence (Molina, Tijus, & Jouen, 2008; Spruijt, van der Kamp, & Steenbergen, 2015). The fine tuning of MI development is commonly observed by 9 years of age (Caeyenberghs, Tsoupas, Wilson, & Smits-Engelsman, 2009) and throughout adolescence (Smits-Engelsman & Wilson, 2013; Skoura, Vinter, & Papaxanthis, 2009). Additionally, to date, most studies addressing MI ability have used the mental rotation (Adams, Lust, Wilson, & Steenbergen, 2017) and mental chronometry (Dahm & Rieger, 2016) paradigms while little research has been done to investigate MI ability through other perspectives, such as accuracy and vividness via questionnaires. Therefore, there is a void in current research literature to where little is known about the development of these perspectives of MI ability across the lifespan and MI’s association with motor proficiency.Study 1 (Chapter 2) investigates age differences in components of MI ability and the association of motor proficiency. This study investigates differences of MI ability between children (n = 101) and young adults (n = 140) and the potential association of motor proficiency. Advanced statistical methods were used to compared differences between groups and to determine which dependent variables contributed to the differences. Results indicated that young adults were significantly more accurate and rated their MI significantly more vivid across all subscales in MI ability when compared to children. Furthermore, between-subject effects for MI accuracy showed that young adults had higher scores than children on three of the four subscales and the action subscale significantly predicted motor proficiency.Additionally, studies have shown that children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), a condition defined by problems in motor coordination, experience problems with tasks thought to rely on internal models of motor control. Study 2 (Chapter 3) compared components of MI ability between typically developing (TD, n = 51) and children with DCD (n= 42). Results indicated that children with DCD were significantly less accurate than TD children, but there were no significant differences in vividness.The findings of these investigations provide crucial insight into the development of MI ability and the association between MI ability and motor proficiency. Developing a better understanding of MI ability and the associated effects of MI deficits on an individual’s motor proficiency can help improve motor skill interventions. Future investigations should further explore the development of MI ability into middle-aged and older adults and the unique characteristics of both components of MI ability. In addition, validating the Florida Praxis Imagery Questionnaire (FPIQ; Ochipa et al., 1997) should be conducted in order to ensure that this questionnaire is appropriately capturing MI accuracy. Lastly, further investigation into the subscales and their potential relationship with MI ability and motor proficiency could help create better motor imagery training.

The child's task was to put a rod into the longer groove of the two stimulus boards presented simultaneously in various spatial arrangements. Main results were as follows: The children could learn to discriminate the line length, and the Weber's ratio in the optimal condition was about. 18. The accuracy of the discrimination improved with age, and was influenced by the various spatial arrangements of the stimuli. To explain these results, a mental transformation framework was suggested, whereby the discrimination of line length was performed by a mental superposition of line segments. That is, when two parallel line segments were superposed by the parallel translation in the representational space, the translation being analyzed into the vector of the direction along the lines and the vector of the direction perpendicular to them, the accuracy of the discrimination of the length was almost prescribed by the norm of the former vector. © 1983, The Japanese Psychological Association.

The present study examined the effects of the color of the bricks (either pink or blue) and the femininity/masculinity of the object built on boys’ and girls’ play with LEGO® sets. Children (n = 116, Mage = 7.27 range = 5–10) were given the opportunity to build with LEGO® brick sets, both instructed and free play tasks. For the instructed task, the type of object (feminine: cat; masculine: dinosaur) and color of the bricks (pink, blue) were counterbalanced across participants. Their play was coded for accuracy of following the instructions and time to complete the task. In the free play task, brick color (pink, blue) was counterbalanced across participants, and structures were coded for femininity/masculinity and the number of bricks used. Overall, children took longer to build a feminine object with blue bricks than with pink bricks. In the free-play task, boys built more masculine objects than girls did, regardless of the color of bricks they were given. Results showed that boys completed the LEGO® tasks faster than did girls, controlling for interest in and experience with LEGO® play. These findings suggest that toy color and type can impact how children interact and play with toys. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2020.104923	This study examined the bidirectional relationships among Chinese children's mathematics, executive functioning, and visual-spatial skills during their  transition from kindergarten to primary school. Participants were 172  Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong children (mean age at Time 1 = 62.75 months; 88 male)  and their parents. At Time 1 (kindergarten K3), children were administered the  measures of mathematics (calculation and applied problems), executive functioning  (working memory and inhibitory control), and visual-spatial skills. They were  reassessed on these measures at Time 2 (primary 1) 1 year later. Results from the  cross-lagged panel model showed that, controlling for child age, gender, and family  socioeconomic status, children's visual-spatial skills at Time 1 were significantly  predictive of their mathematics at Time 2 and children's executive functioning and  visual-spatial skills reciprocally predicted each other across times. However,  children's mathematics at Time 1 were not predictive of their executive functioning  or visual-spatial skills at Time 2.

To this aim, 14 unilaterally and 2 bilaterally amelic participants performed a task requiring the classification of hands depicted in different degrees of rotation as either a left or a right hand. On the same task, 24 normally limbed participants recapitulated previously reported effects; that is, that the hand motor dominance and, more generally, a lifelong use of hands are important determinants of left-right decisions. Unilaterally amelic participants responded slower to hands corresponding to their absent, compared with their existing, hand. Moreover, left and right hand amelic participants showed prolonged reaction times to hands (whether left or right) depicted in unnatural orientations compared with natural orientations. Among the bilateral amelics, the individual with phantom sensations, but not the one without, showed similar differentiation. These findings demonstrate that the visual recognition of a hand never physically developed is prolonged, but still modulated by different rotation angles. They are further compatible with the view that phantom limbs in hand amelia may constrain motor imagery as much as do amputation phantoms. © 2008 The International Neuropsychological Society.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00428.x	In a mental rotation task, children 5 and 6 years of age and adults had to decide as quickly as possible if a photograph of a hand showed a left or a right limb. The  visually presented hands were left and right hands in palm or in back view,  presented in four different angles of rotation. Participants had to give their  responses with their own hands either in a regular, palms-down posture or in an  inverted, palms-up posture. For both children and adults, variation of the posture  of their own hand had a significant effect. Reaction times were longer the more  awkward it was to bring their own hand into the position shown in the stimulus  photograph. These results, together with other converging evidence, strongly suggest  that young children's kinetic imagery is guided by motor processes, even more so  than adults'.

Reilly and G. Mulhern (1995), the authors examined the relationship between self-estimated and psychometrically measured IQs in men and women. In this study, 53 male and 140 female British undergraduates estimated their overall IQs. About 4 months later, they completed a spatial-intelligence (mental-rotation) test. The men estimated their scores significantly higher (120) than the women did (116) and also obtained significantly higher test scores (6.94) than the women did (4.43). There was a very modest but significant correlation between self-estimated IQ and actual IQ score (r =.16). The correlation was significant for the men (r =.27, n = 53) but not for the women (r =.09, n = 140). Removal of a small number of outliers had no significant effect on the results. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This paper describes how different types of exploration of a VR scene by 6 y-old children affected their performance in a series of spatial tasks. Individual children explored a desktop virtual world where we varied both the visual perspective on the VR scene (route vs. survey view) and the level of exploration control (active vs. passive movement). We measured children's knowledge of the spatial layout of the environment through their memory of objects' location in the virtual scene and through the analysis of their wayfinding abilities within the scene. The results indicate that children were able to develop and display different levels of allocentric knowledge about the virtual world depending on the way they had familiarized with it and on the characteristics of the task demands. This finding contributes to inform the design of VR technologies aimed at supporting or evaluating spatial abilities in children of this age. © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00837	Congenitally deaf individuals exhibit enhanced visuospatial abilities relative to normally hearing individuals. An early example is the increased sensitivity of deaf  signers to stimuli in the visual periphery (Neville and Lawson, 1987a). While these  enhancements are robust and extend across a number of visual and spatial skills,  they seem not to extend to other domains which could potentially build on these  enhancements. For example, congenitally deaf children, in the absence of adequate  language exposure and acquisition, do not develop typical social cognition skills as  measured by traditional Theory of Mind tasks. These delays/deficits occur despite  their presumed lifetime use of visuo-perceptual abilities to infer the intentions  and behaviors of others (e.g., Pyers and Senghas, 2009; O'Reilly et al., 2014). In a  series of studies, we explore the limits on the plasticity of visually based  socio-cognitive abilities, from perspective taking to Theory of Mind/False Belief,  in rarely studied individuals: deaf adults who have not acquired a conventional  language (Homesigners). We compared Homesigners' performance to that of two other  understudied groups in the same culture: Deaf signers of an emerging language  (Cohort 1 of Nicaraguan Sign Language), and hearing speakers of Spanish with minimal  schooling. We found that homesigners performed equivalently to both comparison  groups with respect to several visual socio-cognitive abilities: Perspective Taking  (Levels 1 and 2), adapted from Masangkay et al. (1974), and the False Photograph  task, adapted from Leslie and Thaiss (1992). However, a lifetime of visuo-perceptual  experiences (observing the behavior and interactions of others) did not support  success on False Belief tasks, even when linguistic demands were minimized.  Participants in the comparison groups outperformed the Homesigners, but did not  universally pass the False Belief tasks. Our results suggest that while some of the  social development achievements of young typically developing children may be  dissociable from their linguistic experiences, language and/or educational  experiences clearly scaffolds the transition into False Belief understanding. The  lack of experience using a shared language cannot be overcome, even with the benefit  of many years of observing others' behaviors and the potential neural reorganization  and visuospatial enhancements resulting from deafness.

On formal neuropsychological testing, C.O. obtained high scores on tests of general intelligence, episodic memory, language, executive functions, selective attention, visual recognition and visual-spatial abilities. On more specific tasks of familiar and unfamiliar face recognition, C.O. scored above the controls' means on perceptual tests, but obtained highly pathological results on mnesic-associative tests. His disorder of recognition of familiar people was not due to loss of person-specific information, since he obtained highly abnormal naming scores when presented with photographs of famous people but borderline or mildly abnormal scores in a tasks in which he had to name celebrities from verbal definitions. On the other hand, C.O.'s recognition disorder could not be considered to be a form of 'associative prosopagnosia' since a similar defect was observed when he was requested to access information about famous persons through their voice rather than their face. Two alternative interpretations are advanced to explain C.O.'s inability to access his relatively spared person-specific knowledge not only through the person's face but also through the person's voice. The first hypothesis is that, before accessing the person-specific information, unimodal recognition channels must converge into a multimodal, non-verbal person-recognition system and that the right anterior temporal cortices play a crucial role in this integrative activity. The second hypothesis is that the face-recognition units have privileged access to person-specific semantic knowledge and that other recognition subsystems require coactivation of the face-recognition units in order to access person-specific semantic information.

The purpose of this study was to delineate a characterization of language difficulties in a sample of Italian children with achondroplasia and analyze how an untreated language disorder can develop into a learning disability. METHODS: Seventeen Italian children (average age: 5 years and 8 months) with a clinical diagnosis genetically confirmed of achondroplasia were enrolled. Each child underwent a neuropsychological evaluation depending on the age, which included the following areas: intelligence, language, visual-spatial skills, memory, academic achievements, behavior. RESULTS: Most of ACH patients showed delayed speech development milestones. Cognitive evaluation revealed average abilities. All the ACH children have received a diagnosis of language impairment (DSM-5 "The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5° edition"): "Speech sound disorder" in the pre-school-age group, "Language disorder" with impairment of both verbal expression and verbal comprehension in the school age children. CONCLUSIONS: Several studies on general population demonstrated that children with developmental speech and language problems are at considerable risk for learning disability. Considering that in our ACH sample the language disorder has been diagnosed in all children, we expect a higher prevalence of learning disabilities in ACH than in general population. © 2016 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

The study reviewed association of spatial ability, computer experience, and sex of the student with the changes in levels of students' analysis, synthesis, and math problem-solving abilities. Students were pre and post tested for two levels of critical thinking (analysis and synthesis), and level of spatial ability using the Scott-Foresman Developing Cognitive Abilities Test (DCAST) (Beggs and Mouw, 1980). Included in the pre/post test was a validated math problem-solving test to demonstrate changes in the students' abilities to solve problems in mathematics that incorporated the levels of analysis and synthesis. Pre-testing included a researcher-designed computer experience instrument. Two groups (experimental and control) of at least 30 students were randomly assigned from each of the two schools for study.    Results of the study demonstrated that the use of "The Factory" and traditional math instruction was not significantly better than traditional math instruction plus other varied computer activity in enhancing junior-high student's abilities to solve math problems, analyze, or synthesize information. Sex and computer experience were not related to changes in math problem-solving, analysis, or synthesis. Spatial ability was weakly associated with the change in these same variables.

The development of effective intervention programs requires a detailed functional diagnosis of a child's individual strengths and weaknesses. The identification of performance profiles greatly facilitates "tailored" intervention planning. Dyscalculia therapy will be most effective by adhering to a deficit-oriented approach. Specifically, intervention efforts should emphasize the simultaneous establishment of core numerical skills and conceptual arithmetical knowledge. Nonetheless, as dyscalculia frequently is accompanied by deficits in non-numerical cognitive domains (such as language, attention, executive functions, visual-spatial skills, tactile and proprioceptive abilities), therapeutic interventions should consider the latter deficits, too. The most effective teaching method is deficit-oriented and " investigative" (combining constructive, contextual and problem-oriented teaching approaches). As developmental dyscalculia is frequently accompanied by negative emotions (such as math anxiety which in turn might even lead to psychosomatic complaints), effective dyscalculia intervention should be targeted at socio-emotional factors as well. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

One of the issues in the field of perception is whether the visual and somesthetic systems are capable of giving rise to spatial frame work and /or an appreciation in space independent to each other or in combination. Earlier studies have traced out the importance of previous visual experience in execution of spatial imagery task. In this study we investigated the ability of haptic scaling tasks of visually impaired and sighted participants in imagery tasks. The results obtained showed that in addition to earlier visual experience in a sighted person, factors like orientations, configurations and user familiarity are also important in determining some of the spatial abilities in human brain. For visually impaired person, these factors have limited influence i.e., as long as the task is simple and not very complex. © Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12230	Prior research has demonstrated a male advantage in spatial skills and science achievement. The present research integrated these findings by testing the potential  role of spatial skills in gender differences in the science performance of  eighth-grade students (13-15 years old). In (N = 113), the findings showed that  mental rotation ability mediated gender differences in physical science and  technology/engineering test scores. In (N = 73,245), science performance was  examined in a state population of eighth-grade students. As in , the results  revealed larger gender differences on items that showed higher correlations with  mental rotation. These findings underscore the importance of considering spatial  training interventions aimed at reducing gender differences in the science  performance of school-aged children.

Conf. Electr. Eng., Comput. Sci. Autom. Control, CCE	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE.2019.8884492	A study of the behavior of the head movements linked to the visual fixations in girls and boys was carried out while tracking a 2D pattern. With this in mind we reach to formulate the question: Do the boys and girls make different trajectories following a pattern? The purpose of this article is answer this question and help to understand this subject. Thus, in this paper a head-tracking device was developed based on the use of hardware and software capable of illustrating head tracking movements and visual fixations within two patterns with 40 infants (16 boys and 24 girls) for one pattern and 21 infants (8 boys and 13 girls) with ages between 4 and 13 years old, following the ethic code of the declaration of Helsinki. The individual used dark glasses with a pinhole to follow the pattern. A 3-axis accelerometer (X, Y, Z) was attached to a harness on the head, which detects movements of the head in tracing an image and then allows capture the information using a Labview interface. Differences in patterns follow-up between genders were quantified. The multifactorial origin of spatial skills made us wonder if we could observe variances in head movements in boys and girls while tracking a pattern. The results show that the trajectories changed for each individual and also the distance of fixations for each gender varied using a specific 2D pattern. The study shows that the fixation tended to be homogeneous in the center, but changed on the edges of both images. The register suggested that the way that boys and girls follow a pattern is different. The average of the relationships of the distances of the fixations in the girls is a little higher; making us to recognize the fact that girls had a higher average distance for fixation than boys in both cases. Besides, it is shown the tracking and the visual fixations. © 2019 IEEE.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The purpose of this article is to look at the connections between human dignity and art at the Constitutional Court. Is the performance of dignity in the art collection a utopian ideal, achievable objective, or unrealised potential? I argue that the art collection is a kind of visual jurisprudence that responds to, but also comprises, conceptions of human dignity as a right, a value and a touchstone of democracy — conceptions that are closely entwined with South Africa's human rights governance, but that manifest in very different ways. At the same time that human dignity becomes realised by the spatial transformation of the site of the court, it remains in the art collection something that must ever be worked towards. This article arises out of six months of participant observation fieldwork at the Constitutional Court, conducting 54 semi-structured interviews with people involved in the collection. © 2016 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Journal of school psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsp.2018.02.004	Little is known about the development of number knowledge (NK) and the antecedents of low-persistent NK profiles in early childhood. We documented the developmental  trajectories of NK across the transition from preschool to elementary school, their  predictive validity with respect to later math achievement, and the child and family  early-life factors associated with low NK profiles. Children's NK was assessed four  times at regular intervals between the ages 4 and 7 years in a large, representative  population-based sample. Developmental trajectories of NK were established for 1597  children. These children were also assessed with respect to several features of  their family environment at 5, 17, and 29 months, as well as their cognitive skills  at age 41 months. Analyses revealed a best-fitting 4-trajectory model, characterized  by Low-Increasing (10% of the children), Moderate-Increasing (39%), Moderate-Fast  Increasing (32%) and High-Increasing (19%) groups. Children of these trajectory  groups differed significantly with respect to math achievement at ages 8 and  10 years, with the Low-Increasing group persistently scoring lower than the other  groups throughout these years. Children of Low-Increasing NK group were from  household of lower income and father with low educational background, poorer early  cognitive development, and more importantly, reduced visual-spatial skills and  memory-span. Children displaying reduced cognitive abilities and impoverished living  conditions early in life are at greater risk of low NK throughout late preschool and  school entry, with ensuing difficulties in math achievement. They deserve early  preventive attention to help alleviate later mathematic difficulties.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

These various adaptive functions are the raisons d' être of the large array of cognitive modules that comprise the human mind. These modules are not designed for direct, conscious fitness calculations, but for responding efficiently to stimuli that were probabilistically associated with positive or negative fitness outcomes in ancestral human environments. Two methods - cross- species comparison and reverse engineering - can be used to test adaptive hypotheses about the existence and function of particular cognitive modules.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00676	Background: In motor imitation, taking a partner's perspective often involves a mental body transformation from an embodied, ego-centered viewpoint to a  disembodied, hetero-centered viewpoint. Impairments of both own-body-transformation  (OBT) and abnormalities in visual-spatial processing have been reported in patients  with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In the  context of a visual-motor interactive task, studying OBT impairments while  disentangling the contribution of visual-spatial impairments associated with motor  coordination problems has not been investigated. Methods: 85 children and  adolescents (39 controls with typical development, TD; 29 patients with ASD; 17  patients with developmental coordination disorder, DCD), aged 6-19 years,  participated in a behavioral paradigm in which participants interacted with a  virtual tightrope walker (TW) standing and moving with him. The protocol enables to  distinguish ego-centered and hetero-centered perspectives. Results: We show that (1)  OBT was possible but difficult for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, as  well as for TD children, when the task required the participant to perform a mental  rotation in order to adopt a hetero-centered perspective. (2) Using multivariate  models, hetero-centered perspective score was significantly associated with age, TW  orientation, latency, and diagnosis. ASD and TD groups' performances were close and  significantly correlated with age. However, it was not the case for DCD, since this  group was specifically handicapped by visual-spatial impairments. (3) ASD and DCD  did not perform similarly: motor performance as shown by movement amplitude was  better in DCD than ASD. ASD motor response was more ambiguous and hardly readable.  Conclusion: Changing perspective in a spatial environment is possible for patients  with ASD although delayed compared with TD children. In patients with DCD, their  visual-spatial impairments negatively modulated their performances in the  experiment.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Sophian, Ed., Origins of cognitive skills (pp. 229-293), Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum). Forty-two preschool/kindergarten children were administered the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) and the Arithmetic subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) and were videotaped as they solved 25 simple addition problems. Strategies, and their associated reaction times, used in problem solving were classified in accordance with the strategy choice model. A variable which represented adaptive strategy choices for solving addition problems was significantly correlated with the Arithmetic subtest of the WRAT and with the Arithmetic, Geometric Design, and Mazes subtests of the WPPSI. Component scores for a memory retrieval variable were significantly related to performance on both tests of arithmetic ability; the greater the facility of information retrieval from long-term memory the better the performance on the traditional measures. This pattern of correlations suggested strategy choices for solving addition problems were related to both the numerical and spatial ability domains, whereas the speed of executing the component process of fact retrieval was related only to arithmetic ability. In all, the study provided strong support for the convergent validity of the strategy choice model and modest support for its discriminant validity. Finally, the relationship between information-processing models and reference ability measures was discussed. © 1989.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

These children (n = 42), a group of children who showed variable achievement test performance across grades (n = 16), and a control group of academically normal peers (n = 35) were administered a series of experimental and psychometric tasks. The tasks assessed number comprehension and production skills, counting knowledge, arithmetic skills, working memory, the ease of activation of phonetic representations of words and numbers, and spatial abilities. The children with variable achievement test performance did not differ from the academically normal children in any cognitive domain, whereas the children in the LD groups showed specific patterns of cognitive deficit, above and beyond the influence of IQ.

However, less work has examined the potential for domain-specific and cross-domain relations and, more specifically, examined such relations in younger populations. To bridge the gap, the present study examined: (1) the potential causal direction of the relation between spatial and math skills while also accounting for the potential impact of reading skills on this relation and (2) the domain specificity of cognitive anxieties (spatial and math anxiety) as they relate to their relative cognitive skill in children. In a sample of 599 first graders, we examined potential reciprocal relations between math and spatial skills over two waves of data collection, while considering the potential impact of reading on these relations. Results suggest the existence of bidirectional causal relations between spatial and math skills, which remained significant when accounting for reading skills. We also examined the potential domain-specific and cross-domain relations between math and spatial anxiety and their respective cognitive skills, as well as the potential impact of accounting for reading skills on these relations. Results of these models suggest domain-specific relations between math anxiety and skills, but there is no evidence of domain-specific links between spatial anxiety and skills at this age. These results suggest that spatial skills and math anxiety may be potential targets for interventions to improve math outcomes.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, little research has examined this relation longitudinally. The present study examines the development of and reciprocal relations between spatial and math skills in elementary school students. We administered two spatial tasks and a math task to 312 first- through third-grade students who were tested in the spring for three consecutive school years. Linear growth models showed increases for each skill across the three school years. A random intercepts cross-lagged panel analysis indicated that controlling for task-specific (i.e., autoregressive) growth, there was a relation between spatial visualization/mental rotation at Year 1 and math performance at Year 2. In addition, math scores in Year 2 predicted Year 3 spatial visualization/mental rotation skills as well as Year 3 spatial perception skills. Further, there were significant differences in task performance depending on grade in school, and there were gender differences in spatial perception and sometimes math performance. Thus, we find some evidence for reciprocal relations between spatial and math skills over development, but our results suggest that the particular type of spatial skill measured is important to consider in studying these relations.

German children (N = 519) completed the Mental Rotations Test (MRT) in the 5th and 6th grades (interval: one year; age range at time 1: 10-11 years). Boys on average outperformed girls on both occasions (dT1 = 0.45; dT2 = 0.35). Strong quantitative change was reflected in increased test scores from time 1 to time 2. The increase was equivalent for girls (d = 1.04) and boys (d = 1.05). Qualitative change was investigated in a multigroup latent transition analysis (LTA) of the MRT items. LTA confirmed findings from prior studies showing that children used different solution strategies to solve the MRT problems. Girls tended to use less efficient strategies than did boys. Moreover, LTA revealed that participants showing inefficient solution strategies at time 1 tended to improve their performance less than students who already showed more elaborate strategies at time 1. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, it is still unclear to what extent the magnitude of the sex differences varies across age, and whether the differences increase with age. In this study, we reanalyzed data from a cross-sectional investigation of N=1624 German students who were tested with the Peters et al.

Perceptual and Motor Skills, 60, 343–350.]. Sex differences in favor of males were found for all age groups (9–23 years), with d values ranging from .52 to 1.49. Structural equation analyses revealed that overall, sex alone accounted for 16.1% of the variance in latent MRT scores. Furthermore, mental rotation scores increased with age for both genders (ΔR2=.126). The increase was stronger for males than for females as indicated by a small but significant interaction between sex and age (ΔR2=.003). Our findings thus suggest a slight increase in the sex differences as a function of age.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A multigroup latent class analysis of 24 items of the Mental Rotations Test (MRT) was conducted in a sample of 1,695 German pupils and students to find out how many solution strategies can be identified for the items of this test. The results showed that five subgroups (latent classes) can be distinguished. Although three of the subgroups differ mainly in the number of items reached, one class shows are very low performance. In another class, a special solution strategy is used. This strategy seems to involve analytic rather than mental rotation processes and is efficient only for a special MRT item type, indicating that not all MRT items require a mental rotation approach. In addition, the multigroup analysis revealed significant sex differences with respect to the class assignment, confirming prior findings that on average male participants perform mental rotation tasks faster and better than female participants. Females were also overrepresented in the analytic strategy class. The results are discussed with respect to psychometric and substantive implications, and suggestions for the optimization of the MRT items are provided.

Ninety-two children with a DSM-IV-TR ADHD diagnosis, aged 7–13, receiving NFB (n = 33), MPH (n = 28), or PA (n = 31), were re-assessed 6-months after the interventions. NFB comprised theta/beta training on the vertex (cortical zero). PA comprised moderate to vigorous intensity exercises. Outcome measures included parent and teacher behavioral reports, and neurocognitive measures (auditory oddball, stop-signal, and visual spatial working memory tasks). At follow-up, longitudinal hierarchical multilevel model analyses revealed no significant group differences for parent reports and neurocognitive measures (p = .058–.997), except for improved inhibition in MPH compared to NFB (p = .040) and faster response speed in NFB compared to PA (p = .012) during the stop-signal task. These effects, however, disappeared after controlling for medication use at follow-up. Interestingly, teacher reports showed less inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity at follow-up for NFB than PA (p = .004–.010), even after controlling for medication use (p = .013–.036). Our findings indicate that the superior results previously found for parent reports and neurocognitive outcome measures obtained with MPH compared to NFB and PA post intervention became smaller or non-significant at follow-up. Teacher reports suggested superior effects of NFB over PA; however, some children had different teachers at follow-up. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Very preterm born children showed deficits in visual-spatial abilities (medium to large effect sizes) but not in visual closure perception. Tests reporting broad visual perceptive indices showed inconclusive results. In addition, impaired visual-motor integration was found (medium effect size), particularly in boys compared to girls. The observed visual-spatial and visual-motor integration deficits may arise from affected occipital-parietal-frontal neural circuitries. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research suggests the involvement of spatial skills, especially during arithmetic skill acquisition. We assessed the predictive effect of mental rotation on different arithmetic components in children halfway through elementary school. At this stage, additions and subtractions are already well mastered, while multiplications and divisions are newly acquired. Although mental rotation positively correlated with arithmetic performances regardless of operation, only multiplication, division and completion performances were significantly predicted by mental rotation when controlling for age, gender as well as domain-specific symbolic number skills and visuospatial short-term memory. This highlights the differential effects of mental rotation on arithmetic and suggests a particular importance for newly acquired arithmetic material. These findings extend previous research on the relation between spatial skills and arithmetic and yield practical information for mathematical education and instruction. © 2019, PsychOpen.

Forty-three infants were tested using a simplified Shepard-Metzler task to measure mental rotation performance. Prior to the mental rotation task, infants were given the opportunity to manually rotate either a vertically- or a horizontally-striped cylinder around the same vertical movement axis as the mental rotation objects (see Antrilli & Wang, 2016). Results revealed that while there were no signs of mental rotation in non-crawlers, crawlers in the vertical-stripe condition showed a novelty preference, whereas crawlers in the horizontal-stripe condition preferred to look at the familiar test object during the mental rotation task. This suggests that crawling is associated with a more differentiated processing of self-generated rotation-specific visual cues than non-crawling. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Fifty-nine 7-month-old infants were tested in a preferential looking task with a real object and its pictorial counterpart. All of the infants also participated in a manual object exploration task, in which they freely explored five toy blocks. Results revealed a significant positive relationship between infants’ haptic scan levels in the manual object exploration task and their gaze behavior in the preferential looking task: The higher infants’ haptic scan levels, the longer they looked at real objects compared to pictures. Our findings suggest that the specific exploratory action of haptically scanning an object is associated with infants’ visual preference for real objects over pictures.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2018.01.001	The current study investigated whether 9-month-old infants' mental rotation performance was influenced by the magnitude of the angle of object rotation and  their crawling ability. A total of 76 infants were tested; of these infants, 39 had  been crawling for an average of 9.0 weeks. Infants were habituated to a video of a  simplified Shepard-Metzler object (Shepard & Metzler, 1971), always rotating forward  through a 180° angle around the horizontal axis of the object. After habituation, in  two different test conditions, infants were presented with test videos of the same  object rotating farther forward through a previously unseen 90° angle and with a  test video of its mirror image. The two test conditions differed in the magnitude of  the gap between the end of the habituation rotations and the beginning of the test  rotations. The gaps were 0° and 54°. The results revealed that the mental rotation  performance was influenced by the magnitude of the gaps only for the crawling  infants. Their response showed significant transition from a preference for the  mirror object rotations toward a preference for the familiar habituation object  rotations. Thus, the results provide first evidence that it is easier for  9-month-old crawling infants to mentally rotate an object along a small angle  compared with a large one.

In addition to affecting written tasks, visual-spatial deficits also have implications for the social functioning of children. Children who are not able to accurately process visual-spatial information will have difficulty processing the visual, nonverbal cues present in social situations including facial expressions, hand movements, and body posture (Nowicki & Duke, 1992). These social perception deficits make social interactions difficult for these children. As a result of their social differences, they are likely to get negative reactions from others, have social skills deficits (Petti, Voelker, Shore, and Hayman-Abello, 2003), and have much difficulty fitting in with same-aged peers. These social skills deficits will likely lead to internalized adjustment problems in which these children feel isolated, withdrawn, and depressed around their peers. This sequence of events, visual-spatial deficits, followed by social perception deficits, followed by social skills deficits, which ultimately lead to internalized emotional problems, is implied, but not empirically proven, in a study by Petti and colleagues (2003). In addition to experiencing greater socioemotional problems than other LD subtypes, visual-spatial and social deficits of children with NVLD have been shown to worsen with age (Casey, Rourke and Picard, 1991).    This dissertation study investigated the relation between these four constructs (i.e., visual-spatial skills, social perception, social skills, and internalized emotional functioning). It was hypothesized that social perception and social skills mediate the relationship between visual-spatial skills and internalized emotional functioning. In addition, these deficits were expected to increase as these children get older.  As NVLD and AS are commonly co-morbid with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder-Predominantly Inattentive Type (ADHD: PI; Gross-Tsur & Shalev, 1995; Voeller, 1996), this diagnostic group was compared to children diagnosed with ADHD: PI. An additional aim of this study was to differentiate the classification of Learning Disability (LD) by demonstrating the socioemotional functioning differences between individuals with NVLD/ADHD: PI and their counterparts—individuals with a Verbal Learning Disability (VLD/ADHD: PI).    Seventy-one children, ranging in age from 8-14 participated in the study and were assigned to one of three groups (e.g., NVLD/AS with ADHD: PI, VLD with ADHD: PI, or ADHD: PI) based on pre-determined criteria. The NVLD/AS group, as expected, showed impairments in all areas (i.e., visual-spatial skills, social perception, social skills, and internalized socioemotional functioning) and significantly differed from one or both of the other groups on each of the four domains. Support was not found for the age effects for the NVLD/AS group. That is, visual-spatial and internalized socioemotional scores did not worsen with increasing age as expected. Also, visual-spatial skills were not significantly related to internalizing socioemotional functioning, and the hypothesized mediation variables were not statistically significant.    The current study contributes to the understanding of individuals with NVLD, an under-studied population. The proposed visual-spatial skills deficits and social perception deficits in Rourke's (1989) theoretical model were supported. This study also offers some insight into the internalizing socioemotional functioning of children with NVLD. It clarifies the heterogeneity of socioemotional functioning among LD children, suggesting that it is children with the LD subtype, namely NVLD, who are at greater risk for social problems.

Childhood onset kidney disease is generally a noncurable and progressive condition that leads to kidney failure by early adulthood. Fortunately, improved identification of kidney problems allows for early intervention, which is thought to slow progression toward end-stage renal disease. In addition, medical interventions for pediatric end-stage renal disease have also improved, allowing children to take advantage of lifesaving renal replacement treatments such as dialysis and kidney transplantation. In spite of improvements in identification and treatment, CKD causes both direct and indirect insults to a variety of organ systems. This paper reviews recently published studies pertaining to the neurocognitive and psychosocial impact of CKD on children of various ages and at various stages of kidney failure. Specific attention is focused on summarizing peer reviewed research that describes associations between kidney functioning and cognitive functioning, language acquisition, visual spatial abilities, memory, and executive functioning. In addition, peer reviewed research describing psychosocial outcomes associated with CKD related to academic achievement, social-behavioral functioning, and quality of life are summarized. The authors also identified disease-specific factors that likely mediate neurocognitive outcomes (e.g., anemia, hypertension, cardiovascular) and endorse the importance of continued interdisciplinary research collaborations that will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for improved neurocognitive functioning after transplantation. The authors conclude this review by describing a multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, National Institutes of Health funded study that is currently examining the developmental outcomes of children with mild to moderate CKD. The authors speculate that the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Prospective Cohort Study (CKiD) findings will provide additional evidence-based guidance for clinicians and researchers working with children and adolescents with deteriorating kidney function to improve medical and developmental outcomes. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

As the life expectancy of DS persons is rapidly increasing, this decline is becoming a dramatic health problem. The aim of this study was to thoroughly evaluate a group of 67 non-demented persons with DS of different ages (11 to 66 years), from a neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric and psychomotor point of view in order to evaluate in a cross-sectional study the age-related adaptive and neuropsychological features, and to possibly identify early signs predictive of cognitive decline. The main finding of this study is that both neuropsychological functions and adaptive skills are lower in adult DS persons over 40 years old, compared to younger ones. In particular, language and short memory skills, frontal lobe functions, visuo-spatial abilities and adaptive behaviour appear to be the more affected domains. A growing deficit in verbal comprehension, along with social isolation, loss of interest and greater fatigue in daily tasks, are the main features found in older, non demented DS persons evaluated in our study. It is proposed that these signs can be alarm bells for incipient dementia, and that neuro-cognitive rehabilitation and psycho-pharmacological interventions must start as soon as the fourth decade (or even earlier) in DS persons, i.e. at an age where interventions can have the greatest efficacy. © 2014 Ghezzo et al.

The complexity of this skill lies in the many factors that compose it. Some researchers tend to believe that spatial perception is a one-breeder concept, while others talk about two main factors, three or even more. Accordingly, several theories on the evolution of spatial perception have been developed, while the factors referring to the advancement of spatial perception such as gender, age and social factor have been investigated. The present research effort focuses on the development of spatial perception and on the skill of mental rotation through the exploitation of a virtual reality learning game. The design of the virtual environment took place in the context of a Master Program within the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, while it is planned to carry out research using the “Children’s Mental Transformation Task (CMTT)” questionnaire. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01528	The present study investigated the use of a tablet computer to assess figure-tracing skills and their relationships with psychological (visual-perceptual processes,  cognitive processes, handwriting skills) and physiological (body mass index,  isometric strength of arms) parameters with school-children of second  (7-8-year-olds) and fourth (9-10-year-olds) grades. We were also interested in  gender differences. The task required tracing of geometric figures on a template,  shown on a tablet screen in light gray, for the segments that make up the target  figure, one at a time. This figure-tracing tablet test allows acquisition and  automated analysis of four parameters: number of strokes (pen lift) for each  segment; oscillations of lines drawn with respect to reference lines; pressure of  pen on tablet; and average speed of tracing. The results show a trade-off between  speed and quality for the tablet parameters, with higher speed associated with more  oscillations with respect to the reference lines, and lower number of strokes for  each segment, in both male and female children. The involvement of visual-motor  integration on the ability to reduce the oscillations in this tablet test was only  seen for the male children, while both the male and female children showed a  relationship between oscillations and more general/abstract visual-spatial  processes. These data confirm the role of visual-motor processes in this  figure-tracing tablet test only for male children, while more general visual-spatial  processes influence the performance in the tablet test for both sexes. We conclude  that the test proposed is useful to screen for grapho-motor difficulties.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias	https://doi.org/10.1177/153331750401900110	This descriptive study took advantage of a scheduled environmental renovation in a secured dementia care unit. A convenience sample of 19 residents who were relocated  to the unit completed a performance-based orientation task involving locating their  own room. The study included a brief structured interview and tests of psychological  function (cognition, depression, and visual-spatial ability) two months after  admission. Intrusions (uninvited entry into another resident's room) were tracked  for one week. Eighty-four percent of participants were able to find their own rooms  during the orientation task. The majority of participants reported use of color (n =  13) and structure (n = 12) as cues for locating their rooms. Thirty-eight percent of  those who could find their own rooms also intruded into others' rooms; these  intrusions were most commonly related to seeking social interaction. The results  attest to the importance of understanding the multiple factors that determine  environmental use in this population.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Since the disease usually breaks out during adolescence, we hypothesized that visual processes that normally develop during adolescence will be affected in schizophrenic adolescents. Method: To test this hypothesis, we tested object naming and mental rotation performance in adolescents with schizophrenia and contrasted it with the performance of two control groups of healthy adolescents and young adults. To further examine the differences during development, we compared the standard performance scores of the three research groups. Results: Comparing the adolescent patients with healthy participants of the same age, we obtained significant difference of functioning in both tests. Moreover, Performance was lower as the disease broke out at an earlier age. Conclusion: The significant correlation between the age of onset of schizophrenia with severity of perceptual damage suggests that the onset of schizophrenia halts the normal development of the visual system. One limitation of the study is the difficulty to test whether the defects are due to the onset of the disease or innate cognitive deficits. Another limitation in this study is scarcity of patients is, but the significant statistical results cover up the theoretical association with reality testing, which is discussed. © 2015, Ariella Gigi.

Two-dimensional spatial orientation ability was assessed in 52 female and 38 male college students with both information-processing and paper-and-pencil tasks. Retrospective indices of pubertal timing and previous experiences with spatial-related activities, as well as measures of the subject's adult sex-role orientation were also obtained. The direction of influence inferred from the pattern of mean differences and the results of simple and multiple regression analyses suggest that gender differences in mental rotation rate as assessed by the information-processing measure are linked to gender differences in spatial-related adolescent experiences, and to a lesser extent, adolescent pubertal timing. On the other hand, gender differences in test accuracy did not appear to be significantly related to gender differences in maturational timing, adolescent activities, or adult sex-role orientation. Implications of these findings for the locus of gender differences in spatial ability and its potentially experiential nature are discussed. © 1989.

Attending to faces and interpreting the important socio-communicative cues presented allows us to understand other’s cognitive states, emotions, wants and desires. This information enables successful social encounters and interactions to take place. Children with ASD not attending to these important social cues on the face may cause some of the socio-communicative impairments observed within this population. Examining how children with ASD attend to faces will enhance our understanding of their communicative impairments. Aim The present thesis therefore aimed to use eye-tracking methodology to examine attention allocation to faces for communicative cues in children with ASD. Method The first line of enquiry examined how children with ASD (n = 21; age = 13y7m) attended to faces presented within their picture communication systems compared to typically developing children matched on chronological age, verbal ability age and visuo-spatial ability age. The next investigation was conducted on the same group of children and examined how children with ASD attended to faces of different familiarity including, familiar, unfamiliar and the child’s own face. These faces were also presented with direct gaze or averted gaze to investigate how this would impact on the children’s allocation of attention. The final exploration highlighted how children with ASD (n = 20; age = 12y3m) attended to socially salient information (faces) and non-socially salient information (objects) presented within social scenes of varying complexity, compared to typically developing controls. Again groups were matched based on chronological age, verbal ability age, and visuo-spatial ability age. Results Children with ASD were shown to allocate attention to faces presented within their picture communication symbols similarly compared to their typically developing counterparts. All children were shown to fixate significantly longer on the face images compared to the object images. The children with ASD fixated for similar amounts of time to the eye and mouth regions regardless of familiarity and gaze direction compared to their controlled matches. All groups looked significantly longer at the eye areas compared to the mouth areas of the faces across all familiarity types. The children also fixated longer on the eye and mouth regions of direct gazing faces compared to the regions presented on the averted gazing faces. The children with ASD fixated on the faces and objects presented within social scenes similar to their typically developing counterparts across all complexity conditions. The children were shown to fixate significantly longer on the objects compared to the faces. Conclusions Children with ASD showed typical allocation of attention to faces. This suggests that faces are not aversive to them and they are able to attend to the relevant areas such as eye and mouth regions. This may have been influenced by the inclusion of high functioning children with ASD. However these results may also suggest that attention allocation and gaze behaviour are not the only factors which contribute to the socio-communicative impairments observed in ASD.

The participants were 23 language-impaired (LI) children (12 from special boarding schools, 11 from language units within mainstream primary schools), whose performance was compared with that of 23 non-language-impaired (NLI) children. The children were matched for age, their overall age range being between 7;0-ll;ll (mean age 8;6). Tasks involved the production and utilisation of plan drawings of a model house. With one exception, results indicated that the LI children showed no deficit in ability on such tasks, and indeed out-performed their NLI peers on many of them.

Research on the developmental trajectories of spatial scaling beyond the pre-school years has been limited by a lack of suitable scaling measures for older children. Here we developed an age-appropriate discrimination scaling task, and demonstrated that children (N = 386) achieve performance gains in spatial scaling skills between 5 and 8-years-of-age, after which no significant improvements were found. Furthermore, the results support the use of relative distance strategies for task completion. These findings contrast to localisation paradigms, where performance reaches a plateau by age 6 and mental transformation strategies are used for scaling. The finding that scaling skills continue to develop until 8 years highlight the potential of scaling interventions in the early primary school years. Such interventions may infer direct benefits on spatial thinking and indirect advantages for science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) achievement. © 2018 The Authors	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2017.04.016	Strong spatial skills are associated with success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) domains. Although there is convincing evidence  that spatial skills are a reliable predictor of mathematical achievement in  preschool children and in university students, there is a lack of research exploring  associations between spatial and mathematics achievement during the primary school  years. To address this question, this study explored associations between  mathematics and spatial skills in children aged 5 and 7years. The study sample  included 12,099 children who participated in both Wave 3 (mean age=5; 02 [years;  months]) and Wave 4 (mean age=7; 03) of the Millennium Cohort Study. Measures  included a standardised assessment of mathematics and the Pattern Construction  subscale of the British Ability Scales II to assess intrinsic-dynamic spatial  skills. Spatial skills at 5 and 7years of age explained a significant 8.8% of the  variation in mathematics achievement at 7years, above that explained by other  predictors of mathematics, including gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and  language skills. This percentage increased to 22.6% without adjustment for language  skills. This study expands previous findings by using a large-scale longitudinal  sample of primary school children, a population that has been largely omitted from  previous research exploring associations between spatial ability and mathematics  achievement. The finding that early and concurrent spatial skills contribute to  mathematics achievement at 7years of age highlights the potential of spatial skills  as a novel target in the design of mathematics interventions for children in this  age range.

C.; Farran, Emily K.	2019	journalArticle	The developmental relations between spatial cognition and mathematics in primary school children.	Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12786	Spatial thinking is an important predictor of mathematics. However, existing data do not determine whether all spatial sub-domains are equally important for mathematics  outcomes nor whether mathematics-spatial associations vary through development. This  study addresses these questions by exploring the developmental relations between  mathematics and spatial skills in children aged 6-10 years (N = 155). We extend  previous findings by assessing and comparing performance across Uttal et al.'s  (2013), four spatial sub-domains. Overall spatial skills explained 5%-14% of the  variation across three mathematics performance measures (standardized mathematics  skills, approximate number sense and number line estimation skills), beyond other  known predictors of mathematics including vocabulary and gender. Spatial scaling  (extrinsic-static sub-domain) was a significant predictor of all mathematics  outcomes, across all ages, highlighting its importance for mathematics in middle  childhood. Other spatial sub-domains were differentially associated with mathematics  in a task- and age-dependent manner. Mental rotation (intrinsic-dynamic skills) was  a significant predictor of mathematics at 6 and 7 years only which suggests that at  approximately 8 years of age there is a transition period regarding the spatial  skills that are important for mathematics. Taken together, the results support the  investigation of spatial training, particularly targeting spatial scaling, as a  means of improving both spatial and mathematical thinking.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12909	There is evidence that spatial thinking is malleable, and that spatial and mathematical skills are associated (Mix et al. [2016] Journal of Experimental  Psychology: General, 145, 1206; Mix et al. [2017] Journal of Cognition and  Development, 18, 465; Uttal et al. [2013] Psychological Bulletin, 139, 352).  However, few studies have investigated transfer of spatial training gains to  mathematics outcomes in children, and no known studies have compared different modes  of spatial instruction (explicit vs. implicit instruction). Based on a sample of 250  participants, this study compared the effectiveness of explicit and implicit spatial  instruction in eliciting near transfer (to the specific spatial skills trained),  intermediate transfer (to untrained spatial skills) and far transfer (to mathematics  domains) at age 8. Spatial scaling and mental rotation skills were chosen as  training targets as previous studies have found, and proposed explanations for,  associations between these skills and mathematics in children of this age (Journal  of Experimental Psychology: General, 145, 2016 and 1206). In this study, spatial  training led to near, intermediate and far transfer of gains. Mental visualization  and proportional reasoning were proposed to explain far transfer from mental  rotation and spatial scaling skills respectively. For most outcomes, except for  geometry, there was no difference in the effectiveness of implicit (practice with  feedback) compared to explicit instruction (instructional videos). From a  theoretical perspective, the study identified a specific causal effect of spatial  skills on mathematics skills in children. Practically, the results also highlight  the potential of instructional videos as a method of introducing spatial thinking  into the classroom.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

There is no information, however, as to whether the results of psychological research are relevant and applicable to geography. This paper summarizes psychologists’ views of spatial skills, discusses them from a geographical perspective, and reports the results of five map-use experiments that were analyzed for sex-based differences among participants. Two of the studies, one with fourth-grade students and one with undergraduates, tested the students’ ability to use cartographic illustrations as an aid to learning geographic information. The remaining experiments investigated how well male and female children and adults could perform typical map-use tasks such as route planning, symbol identification, visual search and estimation, and right/left orientation. In both sets of studies, the main sex-based differences were found in the younger age groups, where boys’ performance was superior to girls’. Among college students, map-use scores for females and males were almost identical. These results suggest that the findings of psychologists regarding sex-based and developmental patterns in spatial abilities may not be directly transferable to geography. © 1984, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In 3 experiments, the authors explored how well 3- to 6-month-old infants could discriminate between optic flow patterns that simulated changes in heading direction. The results suggest that (a) prior to the onset of locomotion, the majority of infants discriminate between optic flow displays that simulate only large (> 22°) changes in heading, (b) there is minimal development in sensitivity between 3 and 6 months, and (c) optic flow alone is sufficient for infants to discriminate heading. These data suggest that spatial abilities associated with the dorsal visual stream undergo prolonged postnatal development and may depend on locomotor experience.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01997	Reading is a highly complex process in which integrative neurocognitive functions are required. Visual-spatial abilities play a pivotal role because of the  multi-faceted visual sensory processing involved in reading. Several studies show  that children with developmental dyslexia (DD) fail to develop effective visual  strategies and that some reading difficulties are linked to visual-spatial deficits.  However, the relationship between visual-spatial skills and reading abilities is  still a controversial issue. Crucially, the role that age plays has not been  investigated in depth in this population, and it is still not clear if  visual-spatial abilities differ across educational stages in DD. The aim of the  present study was to investigate visual-spatial abilities in children with DD and in  age-matched normal readers (NR) according to different educational stages: in  children attending primary school and in children and adolescents attending  secondary school. Moreover, in order to verify whether visual-spatial measures could  predict reading performance, a regression analysis has been performed in younger and  older children. The results showed that younger children with DD performed  significantly worse than NR in a mental rotation task, a more-local visual-spatial  task, a more-global visual-perceptual task and a visual-motor integration task.  However, older children with DD showed deficits in the more-global visual-perceptual  task, in a mental rotation task and in a visual attention task. In younger children,  the regression analysis documented that reading abilities are predicted by the  visual-motor integration task, while in older children only the more-global  visual-perceptual task predicted reading performances. Present findings showed that  visual-spatial deficits in children with DD were age-dependent and that  visual-spatial abilities engaged in reading varied across different educational  stages. In order to better understand their potential role in affecting reading, a  comprehensive description and a multi-componential evaluation of visual-spatial  abilities is needed with children with DD.

In the first experiment 5‐6‐year‐old non‐conserver children were selected during a pre‐test that comprised three spatial transformation tasks. During the test phase, 56 children worked on spatial transformation tasks with an adult partner in four socially marked conditions in which the correctness of the adult model varied. All subjects were individually post‐tested on the same tasks with unmarked content. Results showed that, under the same marked conditions in the test phase, more progress took place, at the post‐test phase, when subjects had interacted with an incorrect adult model than when they had interacted with a correct one. In the second experiment the hypothesis of an interaction between the nature of the material and the kind of social interaction was examined by means of a factorial design in which the factors were adult versus child partner and marked versus unmarked material. The procedures in the pre‐ and post‐test phase were carried out in the same way as in Experiment I. In the test phase 61 non‐conserver children interacted with partners who presented completely incorrect model. The results of post‐test phase indicated that there was a main effect of social marking although findings of a condition in which children interact with another child on unmarked material also have shown a certain amount of progress. The findings are discussed with respect to the psycho‐social model of cognitive development. Copyright © 1987 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, DNMTP training of rats can take two months, and we aimed to reduce this. Methods: Two experiments were conducted on rats in an operant DNMTP task. Improvements were made on the training procedure. The method was validated by replicating the effect of scopolamine on working memory. The experiments also explored the influence of physostigmine in reversing impairment induced by scopolamine. Thus in experiment 1, ten Lewis rats were trained in an operant DNMTP task (1, 2, 4 and 8 s delay intervals) before 9 of them received vehicle, scopolamine, saline or combinations of scopolamine and physostigmine. In experiment 2, ten Lewis rats (5 old and 5 young) were trained in the same task (1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 s delay intervals). There were six treatments: 0.05 mg/kg scopolamine, 0.1 mg/kg physostigmine or 0.15 mg/kg physostigmine, control involving saline or involving no injection and no handling, and finally a combined treatment of 0.05mg/kg scopolamine and 0.15 mg/kg physostigmine. In both experiments scopolamine significantly reduced correct responses, nose-pokes and lever presses compaired to control conditions. Furthermore, in experiment 2, there was insignificant difference between saline and combined scopolamine/physostigmine for correct responses and for delay prior to pressing the sample lever. As expected, there was significant difference between scopolamine and combined scopolamine/physostigmine for correct responses, for delay prior to pressing the sample lever and for delay prior to pressing the non-matching lever. As a result, the animals were ready for drug injection after 17 days from habituation and the method ensured that there were no dropouts due to left or right lever preference. This is a shorter training period than previously thought necessary. The brief training method was validated by replicating the effect of scopolamine on working memory.

This allowed solving the homogeneity problem (insufficient unidimensionality of test material) by which earlier research in this field was affected. The empirical correlations from our sample of 134 families were compared with the theoretically predicted values. Present data do no corroborate the model; however, the problems of its general falsification are discussed. The fact that differences in performance in favour of males exist in the parental generation but not in the filial generation accentuates the importance of environmental factors.

The aim of the study was to evaluate if the relation between story-telling and-acting improved cognitive and motor development of preschooler children respect to a control group. Both experimental groups, regardless the type of toy, improved their non-verbal fluid reasoning competence, narrative abilities and, surprisingly, also imitating hand positions skills. Most interestingly, children who played with construction toy have marked improvement in their visuospatial abilities. © 2018 FrancoAngeli.	AE	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		1	1	1	NA	1	0	0	1

Compared with sham-operated rats, their performance was impaired in both initial entry and repeat entry errors over 12 consecutive problems, using immediate starting replacement for the 6 trials per problem. The configurations of the 12 maze problems are independent, and deficits were seen over the entire course of the testing. This study indicates that Hebb-Williams maze performance deficits after unilateral entorhinal cortex lesion are persistent and can be seen up to 6 months after injury.

The present article first reviews methods of studying children's understanding of maps and discusses the implications of different approaches. Then, using Piaget's theory as a starting point, the current evidence about development and acquisition of aspects of map understanding in preschool and early school age is reviewed. Finally, a new item material for the systematic assessment of various components of map understanding is introduced.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Recently, however, interest seems to be increasing again, one reason being the growing availability of virtual-reality methods that enable researchers to study spatial cognition in the laboratory in completely new ways. Other methodological advances concern the measurement of brain activity while solving spatial tasks and the study of spatial abilities in very young children. Thus, the '.30 barrier' may be overcome through the development of innovative data-collection as well as statistical methods that offer researchers new possibilities to study both inter- and intraindividual differences. By featuring some of these new developments, we hope that this special issue will stimulate new research efforts.

Results from a small randomised controlled trial	PLoS ONE	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206874	Background Cancer related cognitive impairments have been subjectively reported and objectively detected in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and are known to have a profound negative impact on productivity, psychosocial well-being and overall quality of life. Moderate levels of walking are known to be of benefit to the psychosocial well-being of those affected by breast cancer and for managing cognitive impairment in healthy adults, children, and the elderly. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a home-based, self-managed, moderate intensity walking intervention on subjective and objective cognitive functioning in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods A home-based, self-managed intervention that consisted of moderate levels of walking was compared to usual care among breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy in a randomised controlled trial. Outcome measures included changes in subjective (CFQ) and objectively detected cognitive functioning (Stroop, SART and two subscales from the WAIS-Digit Span and Block Design). Fifty participants were randomised to either the intervention group (n = 25), who completed 12 weeks of moderate intensity walking, or to the control group (n = 25) mid-way through chemotherapy. Results Compared with the control group, the self-managed walking intervention had positive effects on perceived cognitive function but not on sustained attention, executive function, memory or visual spatial skills when assessed objectively using neuropsychological measures. Conclusion This home-based, self-managed intervention is beneficial for protecting against perceived cognitive decline in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. There is a need for further research to objectively assess cognitive decline within this population with larger sample sizes of patients. © 2018 Gokal et al.

A randomised controlled trial: study protocol	BMC Public Health	https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-015-1751-0	Background: Evidence suggests chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer is associated with side effects such as cognitive impairment in domains of memory, attention, concentration and executive function. Cognitive impairments reported by patients have been associated with higher levels of emotional distress. To date, intervention studies to alleviate cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy have focused on psycho-educational techniques or cognitive training. Studies have not yet considered physical activity as a potential for alleviating cognitive problems. Physical activity interventions are reported to be effective in alleviating emotional distress and fatigue in those with breast cancer. They have also been reported to improve cognitive functioning in the elderly, in those suffering with dementia and in children. We propose that physical activity could also help to alleviate cognitive impairments in women diagnosed with breast cancer. The study has been designed using a recently developed taxonomy of behaviour change techniques to reliably report the content of the intervention to allow future replication. Method: This study will deliver a home-based moderate intensity walking intervention to women diagnosed with breast cancer mid-way through their chemotherapy treatment and will compare them to patients receiving usual care alone. The primary outcome measure for this intervention is changes in an objective measure of memory assessed using the Digit Span. Secondary outcome measures include: objective measures of executive function; attention; visual spatial skills; self report cognitive function; self-report fatigue; anxiety; depression; mood and self-esteem. As emotional distress has been associated with self-reporting of cognitive problems, this intervention will further test whether emotional distress mediates between the amount of walking undertaken during the intervention period and levels of self-reported cognitive functioning. Discussion: The development of an effective intervention for preventing difficulties in emotional and cognitive functioning of cancer patients' post-treatment will help to guide health care professionals to improve patients' overall quality of life. It will also provide direction for future research, ultimately to improve the day to day functioning of breast cancer survivors.

Alongside psychosocial difficulties, evidence suggests chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer is associated with perceived cognitive impairment and that which is objectively detected in domains of memory, attention, concentration and executive function. As these concerns are becoming more prominent, research has shifted towards managing these side effects and helping to improve overall quality of life and well-being of breast cancer patients and survivors. To our knowledge, intervention studies have not yet considered physical activity as a potential for maintaining cognitive difficulties in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Physical activity interventions are reported to be effective in alleviating emotional distress and fatigue in those with breast cancer. It has also been reported to improve cognitive functioning in the elderly, in those suffering with dementia and in children. It is proposed that physical activity could also help to manage cognitive impairment in female breast cancer patients and improve levels of psychosocial functioning. The aim of this PhD research was to implement a home-based, self-managed, physical activity intervention to alleviate cognitive and psychosocial difficulties experienced by female breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The intervention was designed using goal setting techniques enabling patients to self-manage their walking schedules and minimise input from NHS staff. Method: The randomised controlled trial compared a home-based, self-managed walking intervention to usual care alone among breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Fifty participants were randomised to either the intervention group (n=25), receiving 12 weeks of moderate intensity walking, or the control group (n=25) mid-way through chemotherapy. Participants in the intervention group were provided with a pedometer and were asked to set goals and keep weekly diaries outlining the duration, intensity and exertion of their walking. Levels of psychosocial and cognitive functioning were assessed pre and post intervention in both groups. Primary outcome measures for this intervention were changes in cognitive functioning. Four domains of cognitive functioning were assessed using neuropsychological tests and subjective functioning was measured using The Cognitive Failures Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures were on psychosocial functioning. Results: The self-managed intervention had positive effects on fatigue, self-esteem, mood, levels of physical activity and stage of motivational readiness but not anxiety and depression. Positive benefits of walking were also detected in perceived cognitive function but not in sustained attention, executive function, memory and visual spatial skills when assessed objectively. Qualitative data indicated that the self-managed intervention was feasible, adhered to and received positively during active chemotherapy. Conclusion: The home-based self-managed intervention was beneficial for improving psychosocial well-being and maintaining perceived cognitive functioning among breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.

review	Golbeck, Susan L.	1998	journalArticle	Peer collaboration and children's representation of the horizontal surface of liquid	Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/S0193-3973(99)80056-2	The role of peer collaboration in the acquisition of Euclidean spatial knowledge was examined in 10 and 12 year-olds (N = 85). Following a pre-test on the Piagetian water-level task, children received supplemental experience observing liquid in tipped containers in one of three conditions; alone, with a peer of comparable ability (Matched Dyad) or with a peer of differing ability (Unmatched Dyad). Individual post testing occurred after the intervention. Based upon a model of cognitive change emphasizing the role of sociocognitive conflict in the disequilibration and reequilibration of thought, children working with peers were expected to show greater change in their understanding of horizontality than children working alone. Results supported the hypothesis that children working with peers would show greater change than children working alone. Children in the Matched condition and the less competent partners in the Unmatched condition showed a significant improvement from pre-test to post test. Twelve year olds were more accurate than ten year olds. Males outperformed females, although this difference was not significant. Within the Matched condition significantly more talk occurred than in the Unmatched condition. There was also a significant relationship between the frequency of Organizational comments and cognitive change. Findings demonstrate the value of peer interaction for supporting spatial thinking in middle childhood. Implications or classroom instruction are considered.

To evaluate capabilities among U.S. students, we assessed spatial reasoning skills in 345 introductory geology and upper-level structural geology students. The test measured students' abilities to disembed, visualize, and mentally rotate objects. The results highlight an uneven distribution of spatial skills with a minimum score of 6% and a maximum score of 75% correct responses. Spatial skills are positively correlated with standardized test scores, motivation for learning, STEM major declaration, and number of science courses taken. Our analysis also indicates that the cumulative, informal training of childhood play has the ability to increase spatial reasoning. Spatial skill scores were significantly higher among students who played action, construction, or sports video games in childhood. Male and female students display significant differences in spatial skills, especially for mental rotation, with males outperforming females. However, gender disparities are fully mediated after adjusting for a variety of academic factors and whether students frequently played with construction-based toys. This indicates that gender differences are experiential rather than biological in origin. This study suggests that both formal academic training and extracurricular activities appear to develop spatial skills throughout students' lives and indicates that systematic testing of spatial skills and formal training opportunities for students would facilitate improved spatial reasoning among students. We hypothesize that formal training opportunities for spatial reasoning could increase the potential pool of students who successfully enter STEM careers, including the geosciences, especially among women. © 2018 The Authors.

The current study examined associations between engineering play with wooden unit blocks and mathematics and spatial skills of children with and without disabilities. Participants included 110 preschoolers (44% female; 25% children with disabilities), ages 49–72 months (M = 58.47, SD = 4.46), from the Midwest United States. A confirmatory factor analysis resulted in one engineering play factor including six of the nine engineering play behaviors with good model fit. Correcting for nesting and controlling for demographic covariates in marginal regression models, there was a significant positive association between engineering play and spatial horizontal rotation skills, β = .19. Moderation analyses revealed a significant positive association between engineering play and geometry for children with disabilities, β = .28. Practice or Policy: Findings provide initial evidence that engineering play is related to mathematics and spatial development and may be an important educational approach for supporting cognitive skills and school readiness in typically developing children and children with disabilities. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Early research from this perspective supports its use in framing play as a key learning context. However, no research to date has examined associations between engineering play and other factors linked with early school success, such as executive function, mathematical ability, and spatial ability. Additionally, more research is needed to further validate a new engineering play observational measure. This study had two main goals: (1) to gather early validity data on the engineering play measure as a potentially useful instrument for documenting the occurrence of children's engineering play behaviors in educational contexts, such as block play. This was done by testing the factor structure of the engineering play behaviors in this sample and their association with preschoolers' planning, a key aspect of the engineering design process; (2) to explore associations between preschoolers' engineering play and executive function, mathematical ability, and spatial ability. Participants included 110 preschoolers (62 girls; 48 boys; M = 58.47 months) from 10 classrooms in the Midwest United States coded for their frequency of engagement in each of the nine engineering play behaviors. A confirmatory factor analysis resulted in one engineering play factor including six of the engineering play behaviors. A series of marginal regression models revealed that the engineering play factor was significantly and positively associated with the spatial horizontal rotation transformation. However, engineering play was not significantly related to planning ability, executive function, informal mathematical abilities, or other spatial transformation skills. Follow-up analyses revealed significant positive associations between engineering play and planning, executive function, and geometry for only a subgroup of children (n = 27) who had individualized education program (IEP) status. This was the first of a series of studies planned to evaluate the potential of the engineering play perspective as a tool for understanding young children's development and learning across multiple developmental domains. Although most hypotheses regarding engineering play and cognitive skills were not supported, the study provided partial evidence for the reliability and validity of the engineering play observation measure. Future research should include larger sample sizes with more statistical power, continued refinement of the engineering play observation measure, examination of potential associations with specific early learning domains, including spatial ability and language, and more comparisons of engineering play between typically developing children and children with disabilities.

Behavior genetics	https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01066806	A number of studies have lent support to the sex-linked major gene theory of spatial ability. Expectations arising from this theory (although not necessarily unique to  it) are that spatial ability can be measured in children, that it is the same as  spatial ability in adults, and that an individual's position in a distribution of  spatial ability remains unchanged over time. Results of a longitudinal experiment  utilizing test scores of 76 high school students and their earliertest scores  provide confirmatory evidence for these expectations.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2012.01185.x	Performing action has been found to have a greater impact on learning than observing action. Here we ask whether a particular type of action - the gestures that  accompany talk - affect learning in a comparable way. We gave 158 6-year-old  children instruction in a mental transformation task. Half the children were asked  to produce a Move gesture relevant to the task; half were asked to produce a Point  gesture. The children also observed the experimenter producing either a Move or  Point gesture. Children who produced a Move gesture improved more than children who  observed the Move gesture. Neither producing nor observing the Point gesture  facilitated learning. Doing gesture promotes learning better than seeing gesture, as  long as the gesture conveys information that could help solve the task.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The computed tomography (CT) scans of 29 hydrocephalic children with extracranial shunts were evaluated to determine ventricular size. The subjects were then placed into three groups which included slit ventricles, normal ventricles, and enlarged ventricles. Give a lack of descriptive research about children with slit ventricles, the study: (a) describes the neuropsychological and social-emotional characteristics of children with slit ventricles, (b) compares those children with slit ventricles to their counterparts with normal and enlarged ventricles, and (c) describes neuropsychological consequences associated with ventricular size. When compared to the normal and enlarged ventricle groups, those children with slit ventricles tended to perform better across all measures, although the groups were not found to be statistically significantly different. The children with slit ventricles were found to manifest a lower Performance than Verbal IQ and attain Full Scale IQs which placed them in the low average range of ability. Those subjects with normal and enlarged ventricles attained lower Performance IQ scores when compared to the slit ventricle group. Neuropsychological testing indicated slowed fine motor performance, impaired spatial skills, poor concentration and attention, and impulsivity. The social-emotional and personality measures indicate that the slit ventricle subjects are functioning within normal limits when compared to their nonhandicapped peers on standardized instruments.

Results were broken down by sex and VRQ.    The purpose of the study was to determine which, if any, of the above characteristics (which research has identified as common to all high-achieving scientists) demonstrated a significant positive relationship to school science achievement. Such a relationship could facilitate early identification of those students with potential for high achievement in science.    The sample consisted of 244 English twelve-year-olds with a VRQ of 118 or higher. Spatial ability and VRQ were assessed using a National Foundation for Educational Research standardized test. Three tests developed by Dr. T. J. Harvey of the University of Bath, England, were used to assess biology, physics, and chemistry achievement. Curiosity and science interest levels were measured by the Self-Appraisal of Curiosity and a Science Interest Inventory developed by the author.    Twelve hypotheses were tested. Findings of the study indicated that, in the total sample, spatial ability correlates more significantly with science achievement than does VRQ. However, although males demonstrated significantly greater spatial ability than females, there were fewer significant differences in their science achievement and no significant differences in their science interest levels. Significant differences were found in curiosity levels, and correlations of curiosity and interest with science achievement yielded significant positive coefficients. When data were grouped on the basis of the pupils' stated career choices, categorized as science or nonscience occupations, highly significant coefficients were obtained when the physics and chemistry scores of the science-career group were correlated with their interest scores.

We hope this issue finds you and your families safe and well. Throughout the difficulties of 2020, music, dance, writing, theatre, film, art, and creative pursuits have brought many a sense of joy, peace, and connection. We hope this continues in 2021 and beyond. In this issue, we again bring you articles across aesthetics, creativity, and arts as varied as responses to activist art, workplace idea diversity, and the benefits of drawing, with our new extended page count for even more research. We begin this issue with Trawinki et al.’s study on naïve observers’ liking for portraits. Next, Diessner et al. take on the question of whether olfactory and gustatory sensations can be considered aesthetically beautiful. Moving from aesthetic reaction to artistic production, we next have two articles on visual art creation and one on contact improvisation dance practice. Chamberlain et al. find that when taking a foundational drawing course over the course of 5 months, participants show improvement on mental rotation, representational drawing, disembedding figures, and attentional switching. In our last section, we present seven articles on aspects of creativity, showing the variety and depth of tasks, instructions, settings, and outcomes measured within experimental creativity research. First, McIntosh et al. used a restaurant development task to investigate connections between participant forecasting of idea quality (positive and negative) and postidea self-evaluation of quality and originality. Then Johnson et al. use a semantic distance assessment of idea novelty and diversity across four experiments to test creative output. s. Then Callan et al. use structured interview microanalyses to investigate self-regulated learning on a creative problem-solving task for fifth- and sixth-grade students. Next, Steele et al. looked at the effects of creative paradoxes, such as exploration-exploitation, when developing creative products. Then Taylor looked at task instructions’ effects on self-control and creative cognition. Van Dam et al. then looked at employee workplace perception of supervisor’s process for idea adoption. Finally, Tolins and Fox Tree looked at collaborative performance through lexical divergence in a collaborative humor task.

They included two student groups (beginners and confirmed) and two performer groups (adolescent and adult). They maintained their equilibrium on the platform under different visual and position conditions. The displacements of the seesaw platform were calculated from accelerometer measures. Fast Fourier transform processing of stabilograms allowed spectral frequency analysis. The total spectrum energy and the energies of the three frequency bands (0-0.5 Hz, 0.5-2 Hz, 2-20 Hz) were determined. For all groups, ANOVA indicated that values were higher for eyes-closed than for eyes-open conditions. The visual dependence differed according to age: For 14-year-old students the postural control for dynamic equilibrium was less visually dependent than for 11-year-old students. The 18-year-old dancers, although professional, were more dependent on vision than 14-year-old student dancers. These 18-year-old dancers were still adolescent because they had recently undergone growth acceleration which could disturb their proprioceptive references and internal body representations. Thus, visual input may dominate over the other sensory inputs in the regulation of postural control. (C) Elsevier, Paris.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This ability is useful for orientation and navigation in anatomy and dissection, and may influence anatomy learning. First and second-year undergraduate medical students (N = 194, 56% female) scored well in SA (70, 25 [Median, IQR], men scored more than women: 70, 20 vs 60, 30; p < 0.01). Three months later, 104 students retook the SA test and scored higher than on the first (75, 20; Difference -5.7, p < 0.01); 29 of them (intervention group) received two sessions of Spatial Awareness Training (SATr), their post-training scores were not significantly different than those of the control group (n = 75) (Difference 0.24, p 0.95). Women in the intervention group scored more in the second test (p 0.03), than women in the control group (p 0.1), with no post –intervention difference between them (p 0.3). Men in both groups improved on the second test (Int. p < 0.001; Ctrl. p 0.02) with no post-test difference (p 0.1). Participants with scores in the bottom quartile in SA did poorly in the final anatomy score compared to the rest (p < 0.001), no correlation between SA scores and anatomy was apparent. In addition, the intervention group underwent testing in Manual Dexterity (MDx), the ability to use hands and fingers for specific tasks; this group improved after SATr (93.5 vs 103.3, p 0.02). There was no correlation between MDx and SA. Post-hoc power was 0.51. Improvement in SA and MDx scores may result from a learning effect and/or learning anatomy. Whilst SA and MDx may improve with time in the medical programme, the introduction of a compact programme of Spatial Awareness Training did not show significant benefits in spatial ability or anatomy. Future studies may aim at increasing sample size, power and duration of the intervention in a fully experimental design.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

These deictic words have the role of orienting another person’s attention to an object on space. The overall goal of this work is to explore the ways in which the study of demonstratives can be used to understand the development of joint attention, communication, spatial organisation, and the understanding of perspectives. Chapter 1 is an introduction to deictic communication. It presents a literature review of adults’ mapping of demonstratives onto space, and of children’s acquisition of demonstratives. Then, chapters 2 to 4 are three studies that focus on different stages of development: 18 to 24 months in Chapter 2, 3 to 5 years old in chapter 3, and 7 to 11 in Chapter 4. The study in Chapter 2 focuses on infants’ acquisition of demonstratives. Open-source corpus linguistics and parental report data were used to describe infants’ use of demonstratives in English and Spanish. Unlike previously thought, demonstratives emerged typically after the 50th word and in two-word utterances. Chapter 3 presents a study on children’s understanding of demonstratives’ distance contrast. Results indicate this is achieved by age 4, but no relation with theory of mind, visual perspective taking or spatial skills was found. The study in Chapter 4 focused on unconstrained demonstrative production and conceptualisation of space. Results show that demonstrative choice was immature at 7 years and still developing at 11 years. Children were sensitive to object characteristics (ownership), indicating that demonstrative use reflects conceptual instead of physical proximity distinctions from early on. Finally, Chapter 5 is a general discussion of the findings and future directions. In sum, the acquisition of demonstratives is a protracted process that emerges in infancy and extends beyond the school years.	AE	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		ASK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		5	5	1	NA	5	0	0	1

Method: In order to examine effects of age, gender, communication mode and use of cochlear implants on AWARDNeuropsychological battery performance, we analyze the results obtained by a group of 67 prelingually deaf children divided in three age groups (3-5, 6-8 and 9-16 years old) in tasks of vocabulary, selective attention, visuo-spatial skills, visual memory, abstract reasoning, sequential processing and praxis. Results: When comparing the different age groups, the results showed significant differences in most of the neuropsychological tasks. In addition, the communication mode was related significantly to performance on some tasks. Discussion and conclusion: AWARDNeuropsychological battery could become a useful tool for cognitive assessment of school-age deaf children who using different communication mode. Recently this battery has been implemented with adaptive web technology, allowing easy and quick access to the tool between professionals working with deaf children. © Education &amp; Psychology I+D+i and Editorial EOS (España).

In array rotation, the subject faces an array and is asked what they would see if the array were rotated.  In viewer rotation, they are asked what they would see if they, the viewer, moved round to another viewpoint.  The tasks are logically similar.  Both involve imagining a change in the relation between viewer and array that would result from a rotational transformation, and so mental rotation is often referred to as a single component of spatial ability.  There is also a tendency to assume that mental rotation tasks are solved using rotation processes.Using a developmental approach, seven experiments with children aged 3-11 years, demonstrated the importance of distinguishing between the two types of mental rotation.In Experiments 1-5, unspeeded tasks were used, reflecting the conditions of everyday life.  The strategies that emerged were either non-rotational, or involved rotation of single features of the array, and were different for array rotation and viewer rotation.  A previous claim, that this difference was a result of the type of spatial framework that young children use, was refuted.Experiments 6 and 7 used speeded RT tasks to encourage the use of rotational strategies.  Performance on a classic array rotation task was compared with performance on a new viewer rotation task and revealed a double dissociation, in which some subjects were at ceiling on one task and at chance on the other task.  Moreover, the relation between the speeds of rotation on the two tasks was weak, although the relation between the non-rotational aspects was strong.  This suggested that there are two distinct mental rotation processes.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	youngest participants 3yo, mental rotation	3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Psychological research	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-019-01170-w	Given the interest in improving executive functions, the present study examines a promising combination of two training techniques: neurofeedback training (NFT) and  working memory training (WMT). NFT targeted increasing the amplitude of individual's  upper Alpha frequency band at the parietal midline scalp location (Pz), and WMT  consisted of an established computerized protocol with working memory updating and  set-shifting components. Healthy participants (n = 140) were randomly allocated to  five combinations of training, including visual search training used as an active  control training for the WMT; all five groups were compared to a sixth silent  control group receiving no training. All groups were evaluated before and after  training for resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) and behavioral executive  function measures. The participants in the silent control group were unaware of this  procedure, and received one of the training protocols only after study has ended.  Results demonstrated significant improvement in the practice tasks in all training  groups including non-specific influence of NFT on resting-state EEG spectral  topography. There was only a near transfer effect (improvement in working memory  task) for WMT, which remained significant in the delayed post-test (after 1 month),  in comparison to silent control group but not in comparison to active control  training group. The NFT + WMT combined group showed improved mental rotation ability  both in the post-training and in the follow-up evaluations. This improvement,  however, did not differ significantly from that in the silent control group. We  conclude that the current training protocols, including their combination, have very  limited influence on the executive functions that were assessed in this study.

The eco-centric policy for sustainable development is proposed instead of the currently dominant economic growth paradigm to prevent systemic environmental problems worldwide. The principal solution for Sustainable Development lies in mental transformation towards an eco-centric mindset that prioritizes socio-ecological objectives in human well-being. A Modernized Educational Policy that focuses on eco-centric human development from childhood throughout the lifespan is proposed in order to shape the socio-ecological human mentality and behavior. This educational policy is complemented by appropriate institutional, economic and technological policy tools. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With help of this model the results of studies according to the genetic, somatic and psychosocial domains are reviewed. Microdeletions of the elastin, LIM kinasis, Syntaxin and RFC2 genes are reported, which could explain the somatic (e.g. cardiovascular abnormalities, facial dysmorphology) and the neuropsychological phenotype as well. The latter is defined by a dissociation between verbal and visuo-spatial abilities. Studies show relatively good performance according to different verbal abilities and pronounced weaknesses in the gross, fine and visuospatial domains. Further, social-emotional characteristics of individuals with WBS as friendly and open manner towards other people on one side and behaviour problems as hyperactivity and social problems (e.g. lacking friendships to peers) on the other side are reported. Articles to the different domains are reviewed and the consequences for the praxis and scientific approaches are discussed.	AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Moral dilemmas consisting of information about a character's motives and the consequences of these actions were devised such that the order, concreteness, and imageability of information were systematically varied. Results show that 5-yr-old males, but not females, favored recent information while the other variables had no impact on Ss' moral judgments. Overall, the number of 5-yr-olds who used motive information was not significantly different from the number who used outcome information. In the 4th study, the reasoning strategy was examined rather than the content of children's judgments. Three distinct strategies of reasoning were observed: (a) focusing on either the motive or outcome to the exclusion of the other, (b) switching focus from one piece of information to the other, and finally (c) considering both aspects of the dilemma at a time. These abilities had significant parallels in a spatial rotation task. (15 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved). © 1977 American Psychological Association.

Men with lower T performed better than other groups on measures of spatial/mathematical ability, tasks at which men normally excel. Women with high T scored higher than low-T women on these same measures. T concentrations did not relate significantly to scores on tests that usually favor women or that do not typically show a sex difference. These results support suggestions of a nonlinear relationship between T concentrations and spatial ability, and demonstrate some task specificity in this respect.

Journal of mental deficiency research	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2788.1977.tb00041.x	Psychological tests were administered to a complete population of severely retarded children aged 0-14, from one area of south-east London. The fifty-six children  selected for the present study included all those who had obtained scores on  measures of social maturity, visuo-spatial skills not involving symbolic concepts,  and level of language comprehension. The results show very low correlations between  the age-related quotients obtained for each measure. This suggests that, in severely  retarded children, marked discrepancies can occur between different areas of  cognitive and social development. Some children could be classified as moderately or  mildly retarded on one type of test but as profoundly retarded on another. The  profiles on the tests can be related to diagnosis and behaviour pattern. The  findings highlight the problems of assessment and educational placement of retarded  children.

Cognitive changes and seizures are the most commonly reported presenting manifestation. Stroke-like episodes have also been documented in these individuals. We describe a rare adolescent with Hashimoto encephalopathy who presented with stroke-like symptoms. Patient Description A previously well 15-year-old girl experienced sudden-onset language disturbance and right hemiparesis. Her symptoms resolved, but weeks later, she began experiencing refractory seizures, episodes of status epilepticus, and cognitive decline. An extensive evaluation was unremarkable, but thyroid peroxidase antibodies were elevated, and a diagnosis of Hashimoto encephalitis was made. Steroid therapy was initiated, and her symptoms resolved with return to baseline cognitive function. Conclusion Hashimoto encephalopathy is a highly treatable condition that may be considered in the differential diagnosis of children and adolescents presenting with stroke-like symptoms. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

No visual exposure to the forms was given. Eight sequential conditions presented the first stimulus and then the second, each for up to 10 seconds exposure, to either the left or right hand in the left or right hemispace. Two simultaneous conditions presented forms at the same time to both hands in either the left or right hemispace for a maximum of 15 seconds. Reaction times, total times, and total scores were recorded. Presentation to the left hand or within the left hemispace during sequential, same-hand conditions did not result in better performance; no interaction between hand and space was found. Total score data gave strong support to the idea that conditions which do not require callosal transfer of information result in superior performance. Transfer from the left hemisphere to the right hemisphere (versus transfer from right to left) required lower reaction times, but did not result in higher scores. Sequential conditions yielded lower reaction times, but not higher total scores, compared to simultaneous conditions. Within simultaneous conditions, left hemispace presentation did not yield better reaction times or total scores. Conditions in which hand and space location was the same were not superior in performance when compared to incompatible or crossed hand and space conditions. Males had longer reaction times and total times; accuracy was the same for both sexes. Between the ages of 10 and 14 years there was a significant increase in total correct responses. Reliability coefficients were generally above 0.09. Concurrent validity measures and methodological problems are discussed.	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, to understand the decimal system and to operate with numbers is extremely sophisticated and is subject to a multitude of influencing factors. In the last twenty years, developmental psychology and neuropsychology have contributed to our understanding of the genesis of our number sense. Researchers located responsible brain areas and identified so called basic number processing skills. As many of these basic number processing skills have their origin in the conception of space, it makes sense to examine the question whether spatial ability can explain individual differences in mental arithmetic performance. This study examines the mental arithmetic performance, basic number processing skills, and spatial abilities of 102 children aged between nine and eleven years to answer the following two research questions: (a) to what extent can individual differences in mental arithmetic performance be explained by spatial abilities? (b) Is there only a direct influence of spatial ability on mental arithmetic performance or are there also indirect effects mediated by basic number processing skills? On the one hand, the results show that spatial abilities can explain individual differences in mental arithmetic performance directly. On the other hand, we found that in line with our hypotheses these influences of spatial abilities on mental arithmetic performance were mediated by basic number processing skills. © 2018, GDM.

We analyzed clinical and neuropsychological features associated with seizure control in patients with MTLE-HS who had not undergone resective surgery. Methods We enrolled 40 patients with medically treated MTLE-HS and retrospectively collected the following data from prospective databases: sex, febrile seizures, central nervous system infection, history of head trauma, cognitive impairment, psychiatric disturbances, history of status epilepticus, age at onset of epilepsy, aura, seizure type and frequency, electroencephalography abnormalities, HS side, AEDs, global cognitive status, and neuropsychological functions such as cognitive processing speed, attention and executive functions, verbal and visual memory, language, and visuospatial ability. These factors were compared between patients who achieved seizure control (no seizures or a > 50% reduction in seizure frequency) with AED treatment and those who continued with poor seizure control (increase or no change in frequency or < 50% reduction) after starting treatment. Results The factors associated with poor seizure control in the multivariate analysis were > 2 seizures per month before treatment (odds ratio [OR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–4.8, p = 0.04), moderate or severe cognitive impairment (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.8–7.6, p = 0.02), and impairment of > 2 neuropsychological functions (OR 2.88, 95% CI 2–6.6, p = 0.04). No associations were observed between poor seizure control and specific neuropsychological function impairment. Conclusions Poor seizure control in MTLE-HS is associated with moderate–severe cognitive impairment but not with a specific profile of impairment. Recognizing poor prognostic features such as a high frequency of monthly seizures prior to starting AED treatment could help to identify patients with medically intractable MTLE-HS who may be good candidates for early epilepsy surgery. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It is proposed that: 1. (1) The sex difference in aggressiveness arises out of the role played by the male in the establishment of dominance hierarchies; this role has remained essentially unchanged during mammalian evolution. 2. (2) The sex differences in fearfulness arise out of the role played by the female in the establishment of dominance hierarchies; this role has changed as between primates and nonprimates. 3. (3) The sex difference in spatial ability is in part connected with the male's role in dominance interactions and in part (at the primate level) with his role in the protection of the group from other conspecific groups and from predators. 4. (4) The sex difference in linguistic ability is due to the existence of the mother- infant pair, it being essential that the adult in whose company the growing infant spends most of its time should expose it to an adequate linguistic environment. 5. (5) Neurally, there is an overlap between the structures (in the frontal neocortex) subserving the verbal control of behaviour and those involved in submissive and fearful behaviour; this has the consequence that, in man, the sex difference in fearfulness is connected to the sex difference in verbal abilities. 6. (6)Each of the points 1-5, listed above, are themselves a consequence of the basic division between the roles played by males and females in reproductive behaviour. © 1971.

Could they act alike? Sex differences in brain are one of the most tempting, energetic and controversial territories for neuroscience. Traditionally, evolutionary scientists, imply that females are more kin on childcare and males are better in intra-group and inter-group competition for resources and mates. However these assumptions were not strongly funded, due to the lack of parameter encounter, for instance, cultural clouts. Today, Baron-Cohen, one of the most important researchers for development psychopathology, strongly supports that male brain is principally indented for systemizing and female brain is principally intended for empathizing, as written on his book THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE. Systemizing refers to the ability of figuring out how things work and extract the underlying rules regulating the behaviour of a system. Empathizing on the other hand, is the ability of identifying another person's emotions and thoughts and respond to them appropriately. These terms subsequently introduced different brain types. Firstly, TYPE S or the male brain indicates the brain of someone with better systemizing skills than empathizing, secondly TYPE E or female brain indicated the brain of someone with better empathizing skills than systemizing. Still there is a third type called TYPE B describing a brain type when both systemizing and empathizing skills are balanced. However, great variations can be seen in pathological cases, for example in Asperger's syndrome. For what is more, the present article does not only focus on Baron-Cohen's point of view. Substantiations and validations from a number of other researchers, proving the male systemizing performance, are taken into account. Studies based on historical evidence, newborn's behaviour experiments, Mental Rotation Test, statistics, biological, genetic and hormonal regulation confirmations are supporting the case, giving males an advantage on scheme adaptation. Nevertheless, there are a number of parameters, possible mistakes and everyday life paradigms that can deplete the above evidences, all analyzed and discussed here. © PHARMAKON-Press.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2016.12.005	The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine whether fluid reasoning (FR) plays a significant role in the acquisition of mathematics skills above and beyond  the effects of other cognitive and numerical abilities. Using a longitudinal cohort  sequential design, we examined how FR measured at three assessment occasions, spaced  approximately 1.5years apart, predicted math outcomes for a group of 69 participants  between ages 6 and 21years across all three assessment occasions. We used structural  equation modeling (SEM) to examine the direct and indirect relations between  children's previous cognitive abilities and their future math achievement. A model  including age, FR, vocabulary, and spatial skills accounted for 90% of the variance  in future math achievement. In this model, FR was the only significant predictor of  future math achievement; age, vocabulary, and spatial skills were not significant  predictors. Thus, FR was the only predictor of future math achievement across a wide  age range that spanned primary school and secondary school. These findings build on  Cattell's conceptualization of FR as a scaffold for learning, showing that this  domain-general ability supports the acquisition of rudimentary math skills as well  as the ability to solve more complex mathematical problems.

I incorporated these findings into a novel play-based intervention for children at-risk for math learning disabilities (MLD). My dissertation work is represented in the following three papers.   In the first paper, I synthesized literature identifying the common cognitive precursors to math learning disabilities. I analyzed how core numerical processing weaknesses (e.g. number sense) in early childhood, restrict the developmental plasticity of mathematical learning. Furthermore, I identified how common weaknesses in other domain-general cognitive abilities (e.g. working memory and processing speed) serve to further exacerbate mathematical learning weaknesses in MLD. Taken together, these findings inform theoretically grounded approaches used to identify children with MLD, and identified promising approaches to early intervention.   In the second paper, I sought to characterize the cognitive factors that are most predictive of future math achievement in typically developing children and adolescents. I analyzed data from a longitudinal study of children between 6 and 21 years old who completed a battery of neuropsychological testing at 3 time points over the course of 5 years. I was specifically interested in the role of fluid reasoning (FR), or the ability to think logically to solve novel problems. Fluid reasoning has not been particularly well characterized in relation to math achievement. Structural equation modeling was employed to compare the relative contribution of spatial abilities, verbal reasoning, age, and FR in predicting future math achievement. This model accounted for nearly 90% of the variance in future math achievement. In this model, FR was the only significant predictor of future math achievement; age, vocabulary, and spatial skills were not significant predictors. The findings build on Cattell’s conceptualization of FR as a scaffold for learning, showing that this domain-general ability supports the acquisition of rudimentary math skills as well as the ability to solve more complex mathematical problems.    In the third paper, I pilot-tested a novel game-play intervention for children at risk for math learning disabilities. The intervention involved playing numeracy and cognitive speed games four days per week for 14 weeks. A single-case-study design was employed to evaluate response to intervention in 3 first- and second-grade students. The intervention took place during an after-school program. All three students demonstrated a significant improvement in weekly arithmetic fluency and marginal improvements in processing speed. However, there was variability during baseline testing in arithmetic fluency scores, limiting causal inference. This study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that game-based interventions that train basic numeracy and processing speed skills, may serve as an effective preventative approach that builds on children’s intrinsic motivation to engage in playful learning.

Girls with TS show deficits in visual-spatial skills as well as reduced  brain volume and surface area in the parietal cortex which supports these cognitive  functions. Thus, measuring the developmental trajectory of the parietal cortex and  the associated visual-spatial cognition in TS may provide novel insights into  critical brain-behavior associations. In this longitudinal study, we acquired  structural MRI data and assessed visual-spatial skills in 16 (age: 8.23 ± 2.5) girls  with TS and 13 age-matched controls over two time-points. Gray and white matter  volume, surface area and cortical thickness were calculated from surfaced based  segmentation of bilateral parietal cortices, and the NEPSY Arrows subtest was used  to assess visual-spatial ability. Volumetric and cognitive scalars were modeled to  obtain estimates of age-related change. The results show aberrant growth of white  matter volume (P = 0.011, corrected) and surface area (P = 0.036, corrected) of the  left superior parietal regions during childhood in girls with TS. Other parietal  sub-regions were significantly smaller in girls with TS at both time-points but did  not show different growth trajectories relative to controls. Furthermore, we found  that visual-spatial skills showed a widening deficit for girls with TS relative to  controls (P = 0.003). Young girls with TS demonstrate an aberrant trajectory of  parietal cortical and cognitive development during childhood. Elucidating aberrant  neurodevelopmental trajectories in this population is critical for determining  specific stages of brain maturation that are particularly dependent on TS-related  genetic and hormonal factors.

The research presented here tested whether video games could contribute to the development of spatial representational skills required for humans to "interface" effectively with computer technology, an increasingly important part of the ecology of modern society. We studied university undergraduates in the U.S. to assess the relationship between expertise in a three-dimensional action arcade video game, The Empire Strikes Back, and the skills of dynamic three-dimensional spatial representation, as assessed in a mental paper-folding test. Study 1 established a correlation between video game expertise and skill in spatial representation. The goal of Study 2 was to establish a causal relationship between video game skill and spatial skill through an experimental paradigm. The predicted experimental effect did not occur-that is, short-term video game practice had no effect on mental paperfolding. However, structural equation modeling did provide strong evidence that video game expertise, developed over the long-term, had a beneficial effect on the spatial skill of mental paper folding. In this form, the hypothesis was confirmed. © 1994.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Schizophrenia Research: Cognition	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scog.2017.07.001	Results from twin, family, and adoption studies all suggest that general intelligence is highly heritable. Several studies have shown lower premorbid intelligence in individuals before the onset of both mood disorders and psychosis, as well as in children and adolescents at genetic high risk for developing schizophrenia. Based on these findings, we aim to investigate if the association between educational achievement in parents and intelligence in their offspring is influenced by schizophrenia or mood disorder in parents. In a large population-based sample of young adult male conscripts (n = 156,531) the presence of a mental disorder in the parents were associated with significantly lower offspring scores on a test of general intelligence, the Børge Priens Prøve (BPP), and higher educational attainment in parents was significantly associated with higher BPP test scores in offspring. A significant interaction suggested that the positive association between maternal education and offspring intelligence was stronger in offspring of mothers with schizophrenia compared to the control group (p = 0.03). The associations between parental education and offspring intelligence are also observed when restricting the sample to conscripts whose parents are diagnosed after 30 years of age. In conclusion, findings from this study show a more positive effect of education on offspring intelligence in mothers with schizophrenia compared to mothers from the control group. This effect could have both environmental and genetic explanations. © 2017 The Authors	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Clinical pediatrics	https://doi.org/10.1177/000992280304200503	Congenital heart disease (CHD) is often associated with intellectual, developmental, and academic late effects related to the diagnosis itself and treatment. This  literature review examines what is currently understood about these intellectual and  academic deficits. It appears that children with CHD, and particularly those with  cyanotic CHD, are at risk for significant impairments in visual spatial skills,  visual motor skills, and overall processing speed. Early neurocognitive  interventions, especially with younger children, may prove beneficial for  remediating some of these deficits.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	2	2	0	0	1

All protein contains phenylalanine which in PKU is toxic to the immature nervous system. Brain damage and mental handicap generally ensue but can be averted by restriction of dietary phenylalanine. Cognitive tests are used to monitor development and thus treatment outcome.  Diet therapy prevents intellectual retardation, but mean IQ falls below age-standards and neuropsychological deficits are found in the executive domain. Questions thus remain about how to optimise treatment. This thesis summarises the history of PKU, reviews the neuropsychological literature, presents an empirical analysis of the IQ subtest profile in children representative of the treated classical PKU population and compares subjects from this group with healthy controls on measures of executive function. The historical and neuropsychological overviews concluded that early treatment practices almost certainly compromised cognitive development. The empirical studies replicated the finding that IQ in treated PKU is significantly depressed, but also indicated that adherence to present United Kingdom treatment guidelines normalises verbal but not spatial ability. Evidence from attentional measures suggested that impaired decision-making speed and poor response inhibition might underlie cognitive deficits found in treated PKU such as poor performance on executive tasks and certain measures of spatial skill. This idea is consistent with the hypothesis that executive functioning is specifically deficient, possibly as a consequence of dopamine depletion in prefrontal cortex. Support for the prefrontal executive hypothesis is at present patchy and circumstantial. Further research is required to establish its validity and whether executive deficit in treated PKU has a bearing on everyday adjustment in the individual patient.  Until this is done, national treatment guidelines should not be revised downward.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

The associated hypoxia before or during the surgery may cause damage in the parasaggital area of the cerebral cortex, with resulting difficulty during tasks requiring visual-spatial and visual-motor skills. This study compares the performance of children who received a heart transplant during infancy to that of nonclinical children with no medical complications on three visual-motor measures, three visual-spatial measures, and two computerized visual-spatial tasks---a Block Design Matching task and a Mental Rotation task. The children who received a heart transplant achieved significantly lower scores than the nonclinical children on all three visual-motor measures and all three visual-spatial measures. However, based on the tests' norms, their scores were significantly lower than expected for only two of the visual-motor measures. For the computerized tasks, the children who received a heart transplant had a lower accuracy than the nonclinical children on the Mental Rotation task, but they performed at a similar level on the Block Design Matching task. For the Mental Rotation task, accuracy was significantly lower when the stimuli were closer to upside down. There were no significant differences between the groups' response times for either task. On the Block Design Matching task, the children in both groups responded faster when the images were the same and when the images were less complex. For the Mental Rotation task, the children in both groups responded faster when the stimulus was a letter "R" rather than when it was an "F" or a "G," when the stimulus was a letter rather than a mirror image of a letter, and when the stimulus was closer to the upright position. Consistent support was found only for the hypothesis that children who received a heart transplant would experience difficulty on the visual-motor measures. The differences between the groups on the visual-spatial measures were probably due to a higher SES for the nonclinical children, and the higher level of accuracy on the Mental Rotation task might have been due to the complexity of the task or other skills required (e.g. working memory).

The Barcelona case	Cities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2017.01.013	Mobility of the young population between 6 and 10-year-old has been continuously decreasing the last decades causing problems of health (obesity) and decreasing the development of spatial skills along with the sense of community. The paper focuses on the road between school and home and deals with a specific project called “Camino Escolar” (School Road) which supports parents in the decision to authorize their children to go and walk alone. The empirical case is developed in Barcelona where 136 School Road projects exist but more precisely analyses two specific districts. The methodology is divided into two phases. In the first phase, we conduct an exploratory study based on interviews with the different stakeholders of the education system and conclude on a list of barriers against the development of the School Road project. In the second one, we ask for the parents to prioritize these barriers according to their grade of importance. The results show the different barriers can be classified into four clusters which are physical insecurities, emotional insecurities, the city infrastructure quality and the project management quality. These findings help public managers to better manage such kind of project in order to prepare future cities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In the present study, relations among prenatal  testosterone levels, spatial play experiences, and mental rotation task performance  were explored in 7-year-old boys and girls. A positive correlation was observed  between prenatal testosterone levels and rate of rotation in girls. The findings  were less clear for boys, but suggested the opposite pattern of results. Relations  between spatial play preferences and mental rotation task performance were not  observed in children of either sex. These findings are consistent with the  hypothesis that testosterone acts on the fetal brain to influence the development of  spatial ability.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The underlying tests are based on the assumption that subjects apply homogeneous strategies. However, recent studies suggest that different individuals make use of different strategies for solving the same items. The study presented here tries to analyse the actual problem-solving processes of 9-10 year-old children solving spatial tasks in individual interviews. The results confirm that children use different solution strategies for spatial problems. As described in various studies with adult subjects holistic and analytical strategies could be identified. In particular the highachievement students are able to use analytic strategies and logical reasoning efficiently also in more complex tasks.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A fMRI study	PLoS ONE	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0178172	Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is commonly diagnosed in childhood and adolescence, and the developing brain has to cope with its deleterious effects. Although brain adaptation to the disease may not result in evident cognitive dysfunction, the effects of T1D on neurodevelopment could alter the pattern of BOLD fMRI activation. The aim of this study was to explore the neural BOLD activation pattern in patients with T1D versus that of healthy matched controls while performing two visuospatial working memory tasks, which included a pair of assignments administered through a block design. In the first task (condition A), the subjects were shown a trial sequence of 3 or 4 white squares positioned pseudorandomly around a fixation point on a black background. After a fixed delay, a second corresponding sequence of 3 or 4 red squares was shown that either resembled (direct, 50%) or differed from (50%) the previous stimulation order. The subjects were required to press one button if the two spatial sequences were identical or a second button if they were not. In condition B, the participants had to determine whether the second sequence of red squares appeared in inverse order (inverse, 50%) or not (50%) and respond by pressing a button. If the latter sequence followed an order distinct from the inverse sequence, the subjects were instructed to press a different button. Sixteen patients with normal IQ and without diabetes complications and 16 healthy control subjects participated in the study. In the behavioral analysis, there were no significant differences between the groups in the pure visuo-spatial task, but the patients with diabetes exhibited poorer performance in the task with verbal stimuli (p < .001). However, fMRI analyses revealed that the patients with T1D showed significantly increased activation in the prefrontal inferior cortex, subcortical regions and the cerebellum (in general p < .001). These different activation patterns could be due to adaptive compensation mechanisms that are devoted to improving efficiency while solving more complex cognitive tasks. © 2017 Guàrdia-Olmos et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)	https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.12162	AIM: To investigate the relationship between mental imagery and specific language impairment (SLI) and explore the assumption that children with SLI are less able to  generate mental images and/or convert them, when compared to typical development  (TD) children of the same age. METHODS: Twenty-four children, aged six to eight,  took part in two tests to see how well they generated and rotated mental images. The  participants were 12 SLI children (six boys and six girls) and 12 TD children (six  boys and six girls), matched by age and gender. RESULTS: The statistical analysis  showed a significant difference between the two groups when it came to generating  mental imagery. However, there were no significant differences with regard to  rotating mental imagery. CONCLUSION: The results suggest imagery deficit in  language-impaired children is not caused by mental rotation, but by other aspects of  image processing, such as generation, maintenance and interpretation of visual  images.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2021.105251	Decades of research have established that spatial skills correlate with numerical skills. However, because both spatial and numerical skills are multidimensional, we  sought to determine how specific spatial skills relate to specific numeracy skills.  We used a cohort-sequential design, assessing a large diverse sample of students  (N = 612, initially in pre-kindergarten [pre-K]-3rd grade, 4-9 years of age) at four  time points spanning 2 years. We examined how initial levels of five spatial skills  (visuospatial working memory [VSWM], mental transformation, mental rotation,  proportional reasoning, and analog magnitude system [AMS] acuity) related to initial  levels and growth rates in exact and approximate calculation skills, and we further  investigated number line estimation as a potential mediator. We found unique  patterns of relations between spatial skills and numeracy. Initial levels of mental  rotation, proportional reasoning, and AMS acuity related to initial levels of exact  calculation skill; initial levels of AMS acuity related to initial levels of  approximate calculation; and initial levels of proportional reasoning related to  initial levels of number line estimation. VSWM and mental transformation did not  relate to numeracy skills after controlling for other spatial skills. Initial levels  of number line estimation related to both exact and approximate calculation after  controlling for spatial skills. Notably, neither spatial skills nor number line  estimation predicted growth in exact or approximate calculation skills. These  results indicate that there is specificity in the time-invariant relations between  spatial skills and numeracy, and they suggest that researchers and educators should  treat spatial skills and numeracy as multidimensional constructs with complex and  unique interrelations.

In turn, a strong linear number representation improves other aspects of numerical knowledge such as arithmetic estimation. We tested this hypothesis using 2 longitudinal data sets. First, we found that children's spatial skill (i.e., mental transformation ability) at the beginning of 1st and 2nd grades predicted improvement in linear number line knowledge over the course of the school year. Second, we found that children's spatial skill at age 5 years predicted their performance on an approximate symbolic calculation task at age 8 and that this relation was mediated by children's linear number line knowledge at age 6.

This research explores the complex dynamisms involved in the Turkish modernization process and demonstrates the schism that exists between the historical periods representing social changes and the spatial periods representing the transformation of Ankara house genotype.    Based on the interpretative examination of selected sources, the continuity and change in domestic life is examined within five sub-categories: namely, the relation between public and private realms within domestic space, the relationship between inhabitants and visitors, the social role of women, the upbringing and significance of children, and the impact of material culture on daily life.    Using space syntax methodology, the formal syntactic aspects of 108 exemplary house plans, all designed by Turkish architects for upper-middle class citizens, are examined to uncover the Ankara house genotype. These houses are digitized and syntactic analyses conducted to examine the permeability and visibility properties of domestic spaces. It is suggested that spatial transformation of apartment designs reflect three distinct genotypes in terms of sector differentiation and relation to the exterior: (a) no sector differentiation one entrance; (b) different sectors, multiple entrances; and (c) different sectors, one entrance.    To present the socio-spatial transformation of Turkish domestic culture, a conceptual framework with three categories is proposed. The first category, the definition of boundaries, involves a diachronic examination of houses focusing on functional spaces and service areas. The second, flexibility of definitions, involves a synchronic examination looking at the changes in activity patterns based on time and occupancy, and discussing fluidity of what is considered public and private. The last category, the in-between, examines the significance of the transition spaces in the house, between inside and outside, and between rooms. Through this framework, both social as well as spatial transformations are considered in understanding of the complex dynamisms that reflect cultural change. This change, i.e. modernization, is defined as an evolutionary process that involves a cultural synthesis as two different ways of living encounter each other.

Positive correlations were found between the years of schooling of the parents and their performance. The correlations were higher for rule-inference tests than for tests of rule application. Holding constant the parents' education reduced the correlations between parents' and children's scores on the tests. However, not all tests were equally affected. The largest changes were again in the rule-inference tests, while the Shepard-Metzler rotation test appeared least affected. The data show a pronounced effect of education on analytical ability and indicate that parent-offspring correlations of such tests should be viewed with caution. © 1983 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Psiholoska Obzorja	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919414798&partnerID=40&md5=cc2cb186a0e42a8745b63be604f4f1d2	This article provides an overview of the theoretical underpinnings and some empirical findings regarding the Mozart effect. The »Mozart effect« refers to an enhancement of performance or change in neurophysiological activity associated with listening to Mozart's music. It was first reported in 1993 by researchers at the University of California, Irvine. They decided to choose Mozart since he started composing at the age of four. Thus they suggested that he was exploiting the inherent repertoire of spatial-temporal firing patterns in the cortex. Causal basis for relations between music ability and spatial reasoning ability is provided by the trion model of cortex. In this research context music is used as a window into higher brain functions. The Mozart effect can be referred to two different phenomena. The first is short-term increase in spatial abilities, the other is the possibility of formal training in music to bring benefits to other areas of human's knowledge. The effect can be found in the subsequently improved performance on spatial test results, increased EEG coherence, increased correlations of neurophysiological activity on the temporal and left frontal areas, increased spatial-temporal reasoning after piano lessons in preschool children, an enhanced learning of a maze by rats, changes in amplitude of alpha rhythm and increased interhemispheric coherence, in changes in EEG power and coherence, especially on the right temporal area, significant decreases in epileptiform activity, and enhanced short-term spatial-temporal reasoning in Alzheimer patients. © Drustvo psihologov Slovenije 2003.

Although sex differences in mental rotation performance can be reliably demonstrated as early as age 5 years old, that is, long before puberty, no data exist as to whether preschooler's mental rotation performance is accompanied by sex differences in functional cerebral asymmetry. Based on the electrophysiological brain correlates of mental rotation, we observed a bilateral parietal brain activity for preschool boys whereas the preschool girls' brain activity was clearly lateralized toward the left hemisphere if and only if mental rotation was needed to solve the task.

Previous research in disabled populations has implicated dysfunctional right hemisphere cognitive processes as a cause of MLD and suggested that impaired visual-spatial skills lead to specific MLD error patterns. In this study of 587 nonidentified children with variable intellectual test profiles, the cognitive predictors necessary for math competency were interpreted from a neuropsychological orientation. Results revealed that complex interactions between WISC-III Verbal and Performance subtests were predictive of math word problems and computation skills, suggesting that semantic/mathematics knowledge, working memory, executive function, novel problem solving, and visual-perceptual-motor processes are necessary for mathematics performance. Contrary to the right hemisphere hypothesis of math competency, results suggest that left hemisphere crystallized abilities and frontal executive functions are most predictive of mathematics achievement for children with variable test profiles. Consistent with theoretical and empirical advances regarding lateralization of function, the numerous predictor commonalities found support a reconceptualization of the left-verbal/ right-nonverbal dichotomy of the cognitive processes underlying mathematics competency.

database	Hale, S.	1990	journalArticle	A global developmental trend in cognitive processing speed.	Child development		Children respond more slowly than young adults on a variety of information-processing tasks. The global trend hypothesis posits that processing  speed changes as a function of age, and that all component processes change at the  same rate. A unique prediction of this hypothesis is that the overall response  latencies of children of a particular age should be predictable from the latencies  of young adults performing the same tasks--without regard to the specific  componential makeup of the task. The current effort tested this prediction by  examining the performance of 4 age groups (10-, 12-, 15-, and 19-year-olds) on 4  different tasks (choice reaction time, letter matching, mental rotation, and  abstract matching). An analysis that simultaneously examined performance on all 4  tasks provided strong support for the global trend hypothesis. By plotting each  child group's performance on all 4 tasks as a function of the young adult group's  performance in the corresponding task conditions, precise linear functions were  revealed: 10-year-olds were approximately 1.8 times slower than young adults on all  tasks, and 12-year-olds were approximately 1.5 times slower, whereas 15-year-olds  appeared to process information as fast as young adults.

However, there continues to be disagreement about the best approach to improve the reading skills of deaf children, whether orally through spoken English or visually through American Sign Language (ASL). Recent research reinforces a bimodal (signed and written) and bilingual (ASL and English) linguistic foundation of reading, in support of Cummins (1991; 2006)'s language interdependence theory.   ASL ability has been found to contribute unique variance in the reading skills of deaf participants within the literature. The current study investigates what unique variance ASL may contribute to written English by analyzing test scores of cognitive skills that may predict better PIAT-R: Reading Comprehension scores. These underlying cognitive skills (visuospatial memory, working memory, and mental rotation skills) may allow ASL to contribute to written English skills, despite being separate modalities and ASL not having a written form.    Archival data was used from the Visual Language and Visual Learning Toolkit Project. A factor analysis was used to create four distinct factors (Visuospatial Memory, Verbal Working Memory, Visuospatial Ability, and ASL), and minimize the impact of any missing data. A stepwise regression analysis was conducted to see which factors would create the best prediction model of English reading scores. Further correlational analyses of demographic factors were also performed.    Visuospatial Ability (Mental Rotation Test; MRT) was found to be the sole predictor of English reading scores. Considering the literature's suggestion of enhanced mental rotation skills being an effect of sign language fluency, this suggests that ASL can support written English skills with shared amodal cognitive skills, such as mental rotation. Additionally, verbal working memory skills may provide unique variance not present in the MRT, and further support associative skills between ASL and written English. Correlated demographics suggest early, and consistent exposure to ASL, as well as written English, leads to better mental rotation and written English outcomes.   Further research should continue to focus on the importance of early and full language access, and cognitive skills that support language interdependence.

Cognition	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2009.07.007	Evidence from typical development and neuroimaging studies suggests that level 2 visual perspective taking - the knowledge that different people may see the same  thing differently at the same time - is a mentalising task. Thus, we would expect  children with autism, who fail typical mentalising tasks like false belief, to  perform poorly on level 2 visual perspective taking as well. However, prior data on  this issue are inconclusive. We re-examined this question, testing a group of 23  young autistic children, aged around 8years with a verbal mental age of around  4years and three groups of typical children (n=60) ranging in age from 4 to 8years  on a level 2 visual perspective task and a closely matched mental rotation task. The  results demonstrate that autistic children have difficulty with visual perspective  taking compared to a task requiring mental rotation, relative to typical children.  Furthermore, performance on the level 2 visual perspective taking task correlated  with theory of mind performance. These findings resolve discrepancies in previous  studies of visual perspective taking in autism, and demonstrate that level 2 visual  perspective taking is a mentalising task.

We studied 31 adolescents and young adults with CAH and 19 unaffected sibling controls, who were given standardized spatial tests and tests of other sexually differentiated cognitive functions (verbal fluency, perceptual speed). The possible role of CAH subtype (salt-wasting or simple-virilizing) was evaluated. Only females with the more severe, salt-wasting form of CAH, but not females with the simple-virilizing form, performed significantly better than sex-matched sibling controls on measures of mental rotation. Subtype differences were not significant for verbal fluency or perceptual speed. Severity of prenatal genital virilization, but not postnatal age when medication was started, predicted accuracy on the Mental Rotations Test. Results are consistent with the possibility of an organizational effect of androgens in the central nervous system that impacts the development of spatial abilities. Implications for the timing of the hypothetical critical period are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Recent evidence suggests that reproductive steroids currently available to the central nervous system via the bloodstream may dynamically regulate at least some cognitive functions in adulthood, via their effects on gene transcription or other mechanisms that modify neuronal activity. This mini-review uses working memory and the internal spatial representation of objects (e.g. mental rotation) as examples, to illustrate how current conceptualizations are beginning to recognize endocrine variables, including context-dependent changes in the hormonal milieu of the brain, as sources of between-sex and within-sex variations in cognitive performance.

Hormones and Behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.12.016	Several studies have reported that performance on spatial rotation tests is better at menses than at high estradiol phases of the menstrual cycle in women. These effects are debated because nearly all reports of menstrual cycle variability have relied on a single test, the Mental Rotations Test (MRT, Vandenberg and Kuse, 1978). In the present study, we investigated key features of the MRT that might be responsible for its association with estradiol levels. We hypothesized that associations could be demonstrated for other tasks that share the same characteristics. Forty-four women ages 20–38years, matched on education and general ability, were assessed at low (n=24) or high (n=20) estradiol stages of the menstrual cycle on a set of spatial tests that varied in dimensionality, plane of rotation, angular disparity, and effortfulness. Saliva was used to quantify estradiol and progesterone. Low estradiol was found to be associated with significantly better accuracy on the MRT and also on a mental rotation task that required large angles of rotation but employed only two-dimensional object representations and rotations limited to the picture plane. In contrast, a task using identical stimuli that required only small angles of rotation did not show an estradiol effect. A group difference also was seen on a test of perceptual closure. The results confirm that the estradiol effect is not limited to the MRT, and identify the rotational element, but also aspects of figural perception, as possible processes that may be responsive to estrogens. These findings advance our understanding by showing an association between estradiol and discrete spatial processes. Implications for understanding the origins of the robust sex difference commonly observed on the MRT are discussed.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1
review_done	Hampson, Elizabeth; Rovet, Joanne F.; Altmann, Deborah	1998	journalArticle	Spatial reasoning in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21‐hydroxylase deficiency	Developmental Neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1080/87565649809540713	It has been proposed that exposure of the central nervous system to high concentrations of androgens during sensitive periods in early development may facilitate the ability to process spatial information. Most tests of this proposal have been derived from nonhuman species. To test this hypothesis in humans, we evaluated spatial reasoning in preadolescent children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a condition characterized by elevated androgens during gestation. The Primary Mental Abilities (PMA) Spatial Relations test was administered to 12 children with CAH (7 girls, 5 boys) and 10 unaffected sibling controls (6 girls, 4 boys), ranging in age from 8 to 12 years. Results showed a significant interaction between sex and clinical status. Girls with CAH achieved significantly higher spatial scores than control girls, whereas boys with CAH showed significantly lower spatial scores than control boys. On the PMA Perceptual Speed test, given for comparison, girls with CAH scored significantly lower than control girls, producing a double dissociation. The results demonstrate that group differences in spatial proficiency can be detected in preadolescent children with CAH. The findings replicate and extend results reported previously by Resnick, Berenbaum, Gottesman, and Bouchard (1986), and are consistent with an organizing effect of early androgens on brain areas subserving spatial processes.

Pravention und Rehabilitation	https://doi.org/10.5414/prp20140	Main aim of the present study is to assess intervention effects in the domain of number processing and early arithmetic in preschoolers. More specifically, we aimed at investigating whether there are differential intervention effects between numerical and spatial training programs. According to recent findings, there is a neurofunctional link between spatial and numerical processing. Thus, it is plausible to speculate that early numerical skills may be positively influenced by numerical and spatial training alike. 100 preschool children participated in the present follow-up study (assessments being scheduled 10 and 2 months prior to school entrance). In between the two assessment periods, children underwent specific intervention programs: one focussing on basic numerical knowledge, the second on spatial skills and the third program was targeted at a combined training of numerical and spatial skills. Findings support our working hypothesis by revealing the most impressive numeracy intervention effects with spatial as well as with the combined numerical and spatial training. Results are discussed with respect to current conceptualizations of numerical development. © 2008 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	3	3	0	0	1

This is the first study to examine the validity of the recent revision of the Leiter International Performance Scale (Leiter-R) when used to assess individuals with autistic disorder. This study further explored the patterns of strengths and weaknesses of cognitive functioning in children with autism based on the nonverbal ability factors of fluid reasoning and broad visualization from the Horn-Cattell theory of intelligence. Twenty children with AD-HF matched on age and gender to twenty normal control children were the participants. The dependent variables consisted of each child's scores on the following measures: the Visualization and Reasoning battery of the Leiter-R, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third Edition (WISC-III), the Nonverbal Reasoning factor of the Differential Abilities Scale (DAS), and the Visual Processing factor of the Woodcock-Johnson - Revised Cognitive Battery (WJ-R). A supplemental analysis of the relationship of adaptive functioning to intellectual abilities was also performed using the Scale of Independent Behavior - Revised (SIB-R) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale.    There was mixed evidence of the validity of the Leiter-R in the assessment of children with autistic disorder. Comparisons of the Leiter-R Full Scale, Fluid Reasoning factor and Visualization factor scores all showed high correlations to their corresponding ability measures on the WISC-III, DAS, and WJ-R, indicating that he factor scores on the Leiter-R do indeed measure fluid reasoning (Gf) and visualization (Gv). However, since there were also strong correlations of the Gf and Gv factors to each other, the validity evidence indicates a broader construct may being measured that encompasses both fluid reasoning (Gf) and visualization (Gv). The Fluid Reasoning score of the Leiter-R correlated slightly higher to the Full Scale and Verbal scores of the WISC-III than the Leiter-R Full Scale score, indicating it may be an even more reliable measure of general intellectual functioning than the Leiter-R Full Scale score.    The results of this study also show an overall balance in the fluid reasoning and visualization abilities in children with AD-HF. Though higher visualization scores than fluid reasoning scores were predicted for the children with AD-HF, this study indicates that they do not have isolated visual-spatial skills, but also have a comparable ability to reason and solve problems with abstract stimuli. The results also indicated that the adaptive functioning of children with AD-HF is more consistent with their verbal skills than their nonverbal abilities.    The overall findings of this study indicate that the Leiter-R is a valid measure of general intellectual functioning, fluid reasoning and visualization in children with AD-HF. This study further shows that, though children with AD-HF may have strong visual-spatial abilities, they can also possess similar abilities to reason and problem-solve when using abstract, nonverbal information.

The differences in mathematical abilities among various populations (e.g., children with dyscalculia - difficulty in performing arithmetic calculations), are expressed in differences in counting abilities. In addition, subitizing was found to be gradually affected by spatialabilities.One study that introduced a new method for calculating the subitizing range (i.e.,the maximal number of identified items) found individual differences in the subitizing range in different arrangements. The present study attempted to understand the source of these individual differences. To the best of our knowledge, this is something that has yet been researched.. The present study had four aims, the first was replicating finding by using the ISR (individual subitizing range) algorithm. The second aim was to understand how spatial factors influence the change in ISR following a different spatial organization.We hypothesized that participants with high spatial abilities will be able to detect patterns in random displays. The third aim was to investigate how ISR varies between linear and random arrangement among individuals with different spatial abilities. We hypothesize that individuals with high spatial abilities will be able to detect patterns in random displays, so that the gap in their random ISR to linear ISR will be larger compared to individuals with lower spatial abilities. The final aim was to examine whether the relationship between mathematical abilities (mathematic fluency) and spatial abilities is mediated by subitizing. We hypothesize that the relationship between mathematical abilities and spatial abilities is mediated by ISR.Seventy-one students from the University of Haifa participated in the study. During three sessions, each participant performed five tasks that tested the subitizing range, mathematical abilities, and spatialabilities.We found a relationship between spatial abilities (mental manipulation) and mathematical abilities (mathematic fluency), but this relationship was not mediated by the subitizing range. We found a pattern that indicates that the subitizing range in the random arrangement was higher than in the linear arrangement, which is consistent with our hypothesis. To test whether a similar effect of spatial capabilities can be found in our data, we compared the difference between the subitizing range and the random and linear arrangements for participants with high and low manipulation skills. When comparing participants with low spatial abilities and participants with high spatial abilities, we found a larger difference between the subitizing range in the random arrangement compared to the linear one. We also found a correlation between mathematical and specific spatial abilities in mental manipulation. Lastly, we found that the subitizing range did not mediate the relationship between mathematical fluency and spatial abilities as measured by the two tasks (mental rotation and mental manipulation).Alternate abstract:סוביטייזינג היא היכולת לזהות מספר קטן של אובייקטים בסט )בדר"כ בין שלושה לארבעה(, במהירות, ללא צורך בספירה. נמצא כי הבדלים ביכולות מתמטיות )למשל, בקרב ילדים עם דיסקלקוליה- קושי לבצע חישובים חשבוניים(, מתבטאים בשונות ביכולות ספירה. כמו כן, נמצא שסובטייזינג מושפע מהיכולת המרחבית באופן הדרגתי.למיטב ידיעתנו אין מחקרים שבדקו מקור ההבדלים הבין אישיים בסוביטייזינג המחקר הנוכחי היווה ניסיון להבנת מקור ההבדלים הבין-אישיים הללו. למחקר זה היו ארבע מטרות. המטרה הראשונה הייתה שחזור הממצא שלפיו ההשפעה של הסידור המרחבי על טווח הסוביטייזינג היא הדרגתית. המטרה השנייה הייתה להבין כיצד גורמים מרחביים משפיעים על השינוי בטווח הסוביטיזיינג בעקבות ארגון מרחבי אחר. ההשערה שלנו הייתה שליכולת המרחבית תהיה השפעה על ביצועי המשתתפים. המטרה השלישית הייתה לבדוק כיצד טווח הסוביטייזינג משתנה בין הסידור הלינארי לרנדומלי בקרב אנשים בעלי יכולות מרחביות שונות. שיערנו כי משתתפים בעלי יכולות מרחביות גבוהות יצליחו יותר בסידורים הרנדומליים לעומת הלינאריים, מכיוון שברנדומליים נעשה שימוש ביכולת המרחבית שלהם. המטרה הרביעית והאחרונה הייתה לבדוק האם הקשר בין יכולות מתמטיות )שטף מתמטי( ליכולות מרחביות מתווך על ידי הסובטייזינג. שיערנו כי הקשר בין יכולות מתמטיות ליכולות מרחביות מתווך על ידי הסוביטיזיינג. במחקר השתתפו שבעים ואחד סטודנטים מאוניברסיטת חיפה. כל משתתף ביצע חמש משימות אשר בדקו את טווח הסוביטיזיינג, את יכולות המתמטיות ואת היכולות המרחביות שלו במהלך שלושה מפגשים.מצאנו קשר בין יכולות מרחביות )מניפולציה מנטלית( ליכולות מתמטיות )שטף מתמטי(, אך לא נמצא כי קשר זה מתווך על ידי טווח הסוביטיזיינג. מצאנו דפוס שמראה כי טווח הסוביטייזינג בסידור הרנדומלי היה גבוה יותר מהסידור הליניארי, בהתאם להשערה שלנו. על מנת לבדוק האם ניתן למצוא בנתונים שלנו השפעה דומה של יכולות מרחביות, השווינו את ההבדל בין טווח הסוביטיזיינג בסידורים הרנדומליים והליניאריים עבור משתתפים עם כישורי מניפולציה גבוהים ונמוכים. מצאנו כי בהשוואה בין משתתפים עם יכולות מרחביות נמוכות לבין משתתפים עם יכולות מרחביות גבוהות היה הבדל גדול יותר בין טווח הסוביטיזיינג בסידור הרנדומלי בהשוואה לליניארי. כמו כן, מצאנו מתאם בין שטף מתמטי ליכולות מרחביות ספציפית במניפולציה המנטלית. לבסוף, מצאנו כי טווח הסוביטיזיינג אינו מתווך את הקשר בין שטף מתמטיקה ליכולות מרחביות כפי שנמדד על ידי שתי המשימות )רוטציה מנטלית ומניפולציה מנטלית(.

The S-100 values were also related to functional outcome assessed by the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) at 12 months. Twenty-two patients were re-examined more than 2 years after the SAH, and the initial S-100 values were related to signs of structural brain damage at CT and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to the results of neuropsychological evaluation (NPE). NPE included standardized tests for memory functions, intellectual functions, visuo-spatial abilities, sensory-motor functions, and concept formation. Life-adjustment was assessed by two separate questionnaires. Tests for agnostic dysfunction and the Western aphasia battery test (WABT) were also performed. Patients who were functionally disabled or ultimately died had significantly higher initial CSF concentrations of S-100 protein than patients showing good recovery. Patients with low-attenuated regions and/or increased ventricular size at CT and/or regionally decreased tracer uptake on SPECT had higher S-100 levels during days 2-8 than had patients showing no such changes. Logistic and multiple regression analysis of all characteristics assessed during the acute phase after SAH showed that the CSF S-100 concentration during days 2-8 was the factor best correlated to GOS and findings on CT and/or SPECT. All patients showed varying degrees of cognitive impairment at follow-up. The results of NPE and the WABT were related to outcome assessed by GOS and to increased ventricular size on CT. Women had a stronger feeling of maladjustment, but the scores for life adjustment were otherwise not related to other outcome criteria. It is concluded that the ventricular CSF S-100 concentration during the acute phase after SAH is related not only to the functional outcome as assessed by GOS but also to signs of brain damage seen on late CT and SPECT. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.

However, analyses of the cognitive maps generated  when Ss were asked to imagine either the room rotating (mental rotation) or  themselves moving within the room (perspective-taking) revealed that the accuracy  and completeness of the mental manipulation increased dramatically with age. Only  the cognitive maps of the college students were coherent and accurate during mental  rotation than during perspective-taking. Careful attention was given to the types of  errors made, and several systematic error patterns were identified which reflected  qualitative differences. These qualitative differences indicated mental manipulation  was a two-stage process. In the first stage, a strategy of transformation was  applied to the ordinal spatial relationships contained within the cognitive map.  First graders evidenced difficulty here. In the second stage, more specific  relationships between self and spatial layout were reconstructed. Fifth graders  evidenced difficulty here. In contrast, college students were able to complete both  stages of the process.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Researchers have learned that individuals in both groups are similar in a number of respects. Both engage in self-stimulatory behavior, display unusual sensitivity to noise, are inclined to be musical, are trouble by anxiety, and have obsessive interests. Most people in both clinical categories are mentally retarded. A closer look reveals that individuals with these disorders differ in their respective patterns of cognitive strengths and weaknesses—especially with respect to verbal and spatial intelligence.    The purpose of the study was to examine differences and similarities between individuals with WS and those with autism. Four hypotheses were entertained: (a) relative to their average level of functioning, individuals with WS will display better verbal than spatial skills—those with autism, the reverse pattern; (b) individuals with autism will draw more realistic pictures than mental-age matched peers with WS; (c) individuals with WS will tell more sophisticated, “audience-grabbing” stories than those with autism; and (d) individuals with WS will display more pitch fluctuation while telling stories than those with autism.    To test these hypotheses, 12 individuals with WS and a like number with autism were tested individually on a battery of neuropsychological tests. Due to the impracticality of testing individuals who are severely impaired, only those with high-functioning autism (HFA) were selected for the autistic group. Following the testing, parents of the participants were interviewed about the behaviors of their children.    The results, although complex, generally supported the first two hypotheses of the study, but not the third or fourth. No evidence was found that participants with WS told more sophisticated stories or used more pitch variation when telling them than their HFA counterparts. The parental interviews confirmed initial beliefs about how the two groups would be similar and provided a rich assortment of qualitative information about both.

The British journal of educational psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12371	BACKGROUND: The role of gender in both spatial and mathematics performance has been extensively studied separately, with a male advantage often found in spatial tasks  and mathematics from adolescence. Spatial reasoning is consistently linked to  mathematics proficiency, yet despite this, little research has investigated the role  of spatial orientation and gender in the relationship between spatial reasoning and  mathematics. AIMS: In the present study, three spatial reasoning constructs (mental  rotation, spatial visualization, and spatial orientation) were examined for their  unique contributions to mathematics performance in two samples (Study 1: grade 5;  Study 2: grade 8). In light of the emerging gender gap in mathematics as children  develop, these relationships were explored as a function of gender. SAMPLE:  Eighty-four fifth-grade students participated in Study 1 (43 females, 41 males; mean  age = 11.19 years). Nine hundred and three eighth-grade students participated in  Study 2 (498 females, 405 males; mean age = 13.83 years). METHODS: The three spatial  reasoning constructs (mental rotation, spatial visualization, and spatial  orientation) were examined for their unique contributions to mathematics performance  for females and males in general and across different mathematical content  (geometry-measurement and number sense). RESULTS: Spatial factors accounted for 51%  of the variance in math scores in Study 1 (grade 5) and 32% of the variance in math  scores in Study 2 (grade 8). In both studies, spatial factors predicted a larger  proportion of variance in geometry-measurement than for number sense. Spatial  orientation was found to be a unique contributor in all mathematics models,  object-based spatial skills (mental rotation and spatial visualization) varied in  their contribution to math performance depending on mathematics content and gender.  CONCLUSIONS: The present work highlights the unique contribution of spatial  orientation in the spatial-mathematics relationship and provides insights into the  nature of gender differences in mathematical problem-solving as a function of  spatial reasoning and mathematics content.

Planning and evaluating new curricula or interventions requires understanding these skills and having the means to assess them. Prior developmental research focused primarily on one aspect of dynamic spatial transformations (DST), namely mental rotation. This study broadens our knowledge by addressing another important DST, namely mental folding. We devised a new test suitable for young children. Performance of 180 children between 4 and 7years suggests that mental folding appears at around 5.5years of age, although there were also marked individual differences. These data on the emergence of DST suggest that educational programs targeting this skill could start in preschool or kindergarten and provide a means to assess the effectiveness of such efforts. © 2013 The Authors.

In reconstructing arrays, subjects first positioned that object which would be most prominent to an observer following the imagined transformation. Surprisingly, this occurred even when subjects made an egocentric error by reconstructing a copy of the original array. Hence young children, although apparently egocentric, can imagine themselves in a new position with a new perspective. The mental operations which underlie imagined spatial transformations are discussed in light of the results. © 1976.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Performance decrements were evident on 5 of 11 neuropsychological tests, including Block Design and measures of sustained attention and recent memory. Neuropsychological deficits were not related to emotional changes reported on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist nor to the presence of CT scan abnormality. These results indicate mild residual brain dysfunction following pentaborane intoxication, including possible dysfunction in subcortical regions mediating memory processes and in cortical areas mediating visuo‐spatial abilities.

Sci.

Activity can produce changes in cognitive, psychomotor and affective students. This applies to every learning in the teaching and learning process. Student learning success is determined by several factors that support the success of the teaching-learning process, including the existence of innovative learning techniques in this case is learning to write. Android games are an alternative software that is chosen, with the reason Android tends to be used on mobile drivers such as smartphones and tablet PCs. In the current technological development, children tend to be more familiar with various gadgets, even children under five are now exposed to various gadgets. With the existence of android games and supported by attractive features, it is expected that children know computer technology, lessons for following directions and rules, problem solving and logic exercises, motoric nerve training and spatial skills, can help parents to teach their children in a fun way. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

Blind Ss without other impairment were matched with sighted Ss for age, sex, and estimated intellectual ability. There was a total of 100 blind and sighted Ss from 5 age levels. With control for ordering ability, the sighted Ss performed significantly better than blind Ss on spatial concepts at all grade levels.

These deficits in areas such as language development, reading readiness, and even in the kind of spatial skills that predict later mathematical knowledge, may persist throughout their lifespan. To address such gaps, policymakers have focused largely on schooling as the great equalizer. Yet, children only spend 20% of their waking hours in school. How can developmental scientists and educators address this “other 80%” for the benefit of children’s development? One answer is the Learning Landscapes initiative, which involves crafting carefully planned play experiences that focus on learning outcomes, particularly for children and families from under-resourced communities. Playful learning, a broad pedagogical approach featuring child-directed play methods, provides a unique way to foster learning and engagement organically within the built environment. Learning Landscapes already incorporates several well-documented projects. The Ultimate Block Party brought over 50,000 people to Central Park to engage in playful learning activities. Supermarkets became hotspots for caregiver-child interaction by simply adding prompts for caregiver-child interaction through signage in everyday “trapped” experiences. Urban Thinkscape transformed a bus stop and adjacent lot into a hub for playful learning while families were waiting for public transportation. Finally, Parkopolis is a life-size human board game that fosters STEM and reasoning skills in public spaces. This paper reflects on data from these projects while reflecting on lessons learned and future directions. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In a cross-sectional study with 117 adults and in an 8-yr longitudinal study with 120 adolescents, composers, instrumentalists, and nonmusicians of both sexes were compared by analyses of variance. Results indicate that an optimal T range may exist for the expression of creative musical behavior. This range may be at the bottom of normal male T range and at the top of normal female T range. In addition, musicians were found to attain significantly higher spatial test scores than nonmusicians, both, in an 8-yr-period of adolescent development and in adulthood. © 1992.

When we started our study, 60 boys had reached a mean age of 11.72,60 girls were 11.52 on average. Menarche and mutation served as markeres for maturation. We found that early, mid, and late maturers differed on spatial orientation and on tactile-visual discrimination as measured with the Witelson task. No differences between the maturational groups emerged on verbal fluency and on Wing's Standardized Tests of Musical Intelligence. At some stages, sex differences on spatial, verbal, and musical tests emerged, and disappeared at others. The sex differences in performance levels were not associated with a sex-specific relationship between maturation rate and performance levels. We found indications of the usefulness of sex hormone measurement in relation to cognitive and musical development in adolescence. © 1991 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

The onset of puberty influenced the outcome. Musical talent decreased in those children who attained extremely high test scores on the Wing tests and were able to compose/improvise. The decline was more marked in girls than in boys. The onset of puberty was also related to an increase of spatial ability. The improvement was more marked in girls. The influence of puberty on the relationship between musical talent and visual-spatial ability was reflected in changing pattern of connections between two musical capacities and three spatial factors. © 1987, Sage Publications.

Efficacy of IVIG treatment was recently reported in a patient with LKS related to GRIN2A mutation. Aim and Methods: We describe the efficacy of Immunotherapy in 5 consecutive patients (4 males, age range 6 months-13 years) with molecularly confirmed GRIN-related epileptic encephalopathy (4 with GRIN2A- related epilepsy-aphasia spectrum/epileptic encephalopathy with CSWS, accompanied by verbal, communicative and behavioural regression, and one patient with GRIN2D – related infantile developmental-epileptic encephalopathy). All patients had global developmental delay/ intellectual disability in various degrees, and were resistant to anticonvulsants, but none of the patients had frequent clinical seizures. All patients received monthly infusion of IVIG 2 g/ kg for 6 months; 2 patients were also treated with high-dose corticosteroids. Results: Normalization or near normalization of the EEG was noted in 3 patients, from whom 2 had mild improvement in verbal abilities and communication skills. Perceptual/spatial abilities, as well as executive functions and attention span, remained significantly impaired. Conclusion: according to this preliminary, open-label study, Immunotherapy may lead to a clinical and electrographic improvement in patients with GRIN-related developmental-epileptic encephalopathies. Further studies to validate the efficacy of immunotherapy and the potential role of autoimmunity in GRIN-related disorders are needed. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

database	Havlik, Andrew M.; Carmichael, Duncan A.; Simner, Julia	2015	journalArticle	Do sequence-space synaesthetes have better spatial imagery skills? Yes, but there are individual differences.	Cognitive processing	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-015-0657-1	People with sequence-space synaesthesia perceive sequences (e.g. numbers, months, letters) as spatially extended forms. Here, we ask whether sequence-space  synaesthetes have advantages in visuo-spatial skills such as mental rotation.  Previous studies addressing this question have produced mixed results with some  showing mental rotation advantages (Simner et al. in Cortex 45:1246-1260, 2009;  Brang et al. in Cogn Process, 2013), but one that did not (Rizza and Price in Cogn  Process 13:299-303, 2012). We tested this hypothesis again with a new group of  sequence-space synaesthetes, and we also tested a range of individual differences  that might have caused this conflict across previous studies. Specifically, we  tested: years of education, visual imagery ability, nature of forms (2D or 3D  representation of sequences), number of forms (e.g. for months, days, numbers), and  tendency to project sequences into external space versus the mind's eye. We found  yet again that synaesthetes had enhanced abilities in mental rotation compared to  controls, but that one individual difference in synaesthetes (the ability to project  forms into space) was especially linked to performance. We also found that  synaesthetes self-reported higher visual imagery than controls (Price in Cortex  45:1229-1245, 2009; Mann et al. in Conscious Cognit 18:619-627, 2009; Rizza and  Price 2012). Overall, our data support previous studies showing superior imagery  reports (Price 2009) and mental rotation (Simner et al. 2009; Brang et al. 2013) in  sequence-space synaesthetes, and we suggest that one previous failure to replicate  (Rizza and Price 2012) might be explained by individual differences among  synaesthetes recruited for testing.

The goals of this study were to design and evaluate a novel test of three-dimensional (3D) mental rotation for 4- to 8-year-old children (N=165) that uses tangible 3D objects. Results revealed that the measure was both valid and reliable and indicated steady growth in 3D mental rotation between the ages of 4 and 8. Performance on the measure was highly related to success on a measure of two-dimensional (2D) mental rotation, even after controlling for executive functioning. Although children as young as 5years old performed above chance, 3D mental rotation appears to be a difficult skill for most children under the age of 7, as indicated by frequent guessing and difficulty with mirror objects. The test is a useful new tool for studying the development of 3D mental rotation in young children. © 2015 International Mind, Brain, and Education Society and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Sixty-one 6- to 8-year-olds were randomly assigned to either computerized mental rotation training or literacy training. Training took place on iPad devices over a 6-week period as part of regular classroom activity. Results revealed that in comparison to the control group, children who received spatial training demonstrated significant gains on two measures of mental rotation and marginally significant improvements on an untrained mental transformation task; a finding that suggests that training may have had a general effect on children's spatial ability. However, contrary to theoretical claims and prior empirical findings, there was no evidence that spatial training transferred to mathematics performance. © 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Cognitive psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogpsych.2018.12.002	Current evidence suggests that numerical, spatial, and executive function (EF) skills each play critical and independent roles in the learning and performance of  mathematics. However, these conclusions are largely based on isolated bodies of  research and without measurement at the latent variable level. Thus, questions  remain regarding the latent structure and potentially shared and unique relations  between numerical, spatial, EF, and mathematics abilities. The purpose of the  current study was to (i) confirm the latent structure of the hypothesized constructs  of numerical, spatial, and EF skills and mathematics achievement, (ii) measure their  unique and shared relations with one another, and (iii) test a set of novel  hypotheses aimed to more closely reveal the underlying nature of the oft reported  space-math association. Our analytical approach involved latent-variable analyses  (structural equation modeling) with a sample of 4- to 11-year-old children (N = 316,  M(age) = 6.68 years). Results of a confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that  numerical, spatial, EF, and mathematics skills are highly related, yet separable,  constructs. Follow-up structural analyses revealed that numerical, spatial, and EF  latent variables explained 84% of children's mathematics achievement scores,  controlling for age. However, only numerical and spatial performance were unique  predictors of mathematics achievement. The observed patterns of relations and  developmental trajectories remained stable across age and grade (preschool - 4th  grade). Follow-up mediation analyses revealed that numerical skills, but not EF  skills, partially mediated the relation between spatial skills and mathematics  achievement. Overall, our results point to spatial visualization as a unique and  robust predictor of children's mathematics achievement.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	not sure	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

On examination eight months after the onset, he showed an extreme difficulty in dressing, which did not improve even after repeated trials. He also showed poor judgement of line orientation, impaired ability on constructive task, and prominent difficulty in right left discrimination of objects placed in front of him. Interestingly, his right left orientation about his own body was not impaired. Mild left unilateral neglect and left sided visual extinction on double simultaneous stimuli were also present. No other neuropsychological signs including aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, asomatognosia and amosognosia were present. The detailed experimental investigations showed that his visual imagery and its mental operation were severely impaired. For instance, he was unable to rotate an imagery object in his mind. We concluded that his dressing impairment was inherently related with this difficulty in rotating an imagery object in the mind. A MRI study showed high signal areas in T2 weighted images in the superior parietal lobule, angular gyrus, occipital cortex, and corona radiata of the right cerebral hemisphere. Also a small lesion was detected in the ventral midbrain through the upper pons.	SK	0	0	0	1	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		4	2	0	2	2	0	0	1

Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology	https://doi.org/10.4992/jjpsy.69.130	Using Doise spatial task, this study examined the following three hypotheses about preschoolers' attainment of spatial skills: (1) A different viewpoint promotes  faster advancement through developmental levels of spatial skills than the same  viewpoint. (2) An interaction partner with a different skill level, rather than the  same level, promotes faster advancement. And (3) a socio-cognitive conflict with the  partner promotes faster advancement. To test these hypotheses, the method of Doise  and Mugny (1984) was used in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, the method was modified  in several ways. Most notably by pointing out and changing the shape of the marker,  and by decreasing the number of objects to be arranged. Results of the experiments  supported Hypothesis 3, but not 1 or 2. It was concluded that socio-cognitive  conflicts in preschooler peer interaction contributed to children's development of  spatial skills.

This paper describes work towards an objective assessment that uses an evolutionary algorithm to assess an important symptom of the disease, the loss of visuo-spatial ability. Results are presented for application of the system in assessing the immature visuo-spatial ability of 7-11 year old children, which are used as a model for Alzheimer's disease patients.

After learning a specific route through the space to a goal, Ss were required to invent new routes to the goal. Results indicate that Ss who had been classified as securely attached explored relatively more independently and had less restricted patterns of exploration than did anxiously attached Ss. They also scored higher on tasks on spatial ability. It is proposed that individual differences in security of attachment, mode of exploration, and cognitive mapping abilities exert mutual effects on each other throughout early development. Findings indicate that security of attachment affects later competence in environmental adaptation.

This study explores the relationship between STEM education and development of children's mathematics ability, as manifested in spatial ability. Sixty-five kindergarten students in two classes were selected and a between-subjects design was used in which a randomly assigned experimental classes received STEM courses twice a week for two months, and the other class received regular education. Result indicated that STEM education was associated with significant spatial ability improvement in children aged 5 to 6, and especially in children with intermediate or lower a-priori mathematical ability. The findings also show that STEM training mainly affects children's mathematics ability through building blocks skills. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.722261	Previous studies have found a correlation between numerosity processing and arithmetical performance. Visual perception has already been indicated as the shared  cognitive mechanism between these two; however, these studies mostly focused on  children. It is not clear whether the association between numerosity processing and  arithmetical performance still existed following the development of individual  arithmetical performance. Consequently, the underlying role of visual perception in  numerosity processing and arithmetical performance has not been sufficiently studied  in adults. For this study, researchers selected a total of 205 adult participants  with an average age of 22years. The adults were administered arithmetic tests,  numerosity comparison, and visual figure matching. Mental rotation, choice reaction  time, and nonverbal intelligence were used as cognitive covariates. Results showed  that numerosity comparison of adults correlated with their arithmetical performance,  even after controlling for age and gender differences as well as general cognitive  processing. However, after controlled for visual figure matching, the  well-established association between numerosity comparison and arithmetic  performance disappeared. These results supported the visual perception hypothesis,  that visual perception measured by visual figure matching can account for the  correlation between numerosity comparison and arithmetic performance. This indicated  that even for adult populations, visual perceptual ability was the underlying  component of numerosity processing and arithmetic performance.

The Journal of genetic psychology	https://doi.org/10.1080/00221325.2019.1582474	The authors examined the relative contributions of three aspects of executive function with two-dimensional (2D) mental rotation in children between 8 and  12 years old. Participants were given one standard 2D mental rotation measure, two  working memory tasks (Corsi blocks and digit span), two inhibitory control tasks  (Stroop and go/no go), and two planning ability tests (Tower of Hanoi and Tower of  London). The correlational patterns between executive function and 2D mental  rotation were different depending on age. More inhibitory control in younger  children was associated with better performance in mental rotation, but not in older  children. These results add to the understanding of the specific nature of  children's executive function-mental rotation relations.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.12154	The behavioral and neurobiological connections between play and the development of critical cognitive functions, such as attention, remain largely unknown. We do not  yet know how these connections relate to the formation of specific abilities, such  as spatial ability, and to learning in formal environments, such as in the  classroom. Insights into these issues would be beneficial not only for understanding  play, attention, and learning individually, but also for the development of more  efficacious systems for learning and for the treatment of neurodevelopmental  disorders. Different operational definitions of play can incorporate or exclude  varying types of behavior, emphasize varying developmental time points, and motivate  different research questions. Relevant questions to be explored in this area  include, How do particular kinds of play relate to the development of particular  kinds of abilities later in life? How does play vary across societies and species in  the context of evolution? Does play facilitate a shift from reactive to predictive  timing, and is its connection to timing unique or particularly significant? This  report will outline important research steps that need to be taken in order to  address these and other questions about play, human activity, and cognitive  functions.

We developed a paper-and-pencil test with measures of mental rotations and folding and a wide range of perspective taking tasks. 240 fourth graders were tested. By comparing different models in a confirmatory factor analysis, we found that there is a partial dissociation between object manipulation spatial abilities and perspective transformation abilities. The results specify the degree of overlap, and sex differences concerning the measures but not the underlying constructs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

The results revealed gender differences in all accuracy-based measures, i.e., in the paper-pencil mental rotation test, in the math test, and in the error rate of the chronometrical test. In line with the literature for adults, however, no gender difference was found in the speed of mental rotation itself. Moreover, no evidence for a speed-accuracy tradeoff was found. Thus, gender differences in tasks of math and visual-spatial cognition are present well before puberty but they seem to be restricted to accuracy-based measures. © 2008 Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht GmbH & Co.

An alternative statement exists, however, the finding might be completely unspecific for mental rotation but either be simply a function of task difficulty or a consequence of the use of characters as stimuli. To test these alternatives, ERPs of 24 second graders were measured twice: (a) during mental rotation with characters as stimuli and orientations of 30°, 90°, or 150° and (b) during memory scanning with characters as stimuli and set sizes of 1, 2, or 3 letters. In both cases, an amplitude modulation was found. The effect of mental rotation as a function of character orientation turned out to be lateralized to the left parietal hemisphere. The effect of memory scanning as a function of set size, however, turned out to be completely non-lateralized. Thus, children's left hemisphere activation during mental rotation is reliable as well as specific. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Biological Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.11.002	Men outperform women in mental rotation by about one standard deviation. Prenatal exposure to testosterone has been suggested as one cause. In animals it has been shown that a female fetus located between two male ones is exposed to higher levels of testosterone. It is still unclear whether intra-uterine hormone transfer exists in humans. Therefore, the influence of an intra-uterine presence of a male co twin was studied in female fraternal twins (N=200). Women with a male co-twin outperformed women with a female co-twin by about a third standard deviation. In a no-twin control group (N=200), performance of women with a slightly older sibling did not depend upon the sibling's sex. These findings provide preliminary support for the theory of an influence of prenatal testosterone on mental rotation performance.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Used with children younger than about 9 or 10 years, MRT performance is at chance level. Simpler tasks used with younger children have revealed inconclusive results. Moore and Johnson (2008, 2011) observed sex differences in infants using a habituation task with 3D cube figures rotating back and forth in depth through a 240° angle. Thereafter, female infants treated similarly the original figure and a mirror-image cube figure presented revolving through the previously unseen 120° angle, whereas male infants behaved as if they recognized the familiar object. In the present study, 256 adults participated in the MRT as well as in a modified two-alternative forced-choice dynamic version of the infants’ task. Sex differences were present for both tasks. More importantly, there was a positive correlation in performance across both tasks for both women and men. Since the new task turned out to be simpler, it might be suitable also for children. We present the first, although indirect, evidence that the sex effects reported by Moore and Johnson might indeed reflect early sex differences in mental rotation.

Is their emergence intrinsically linked to visual experience, or does it reflect a core property of cognition shared across sensory modalities? To address this question, we tested the sensitivity of blind-from-birth adults to geometrical-invariants using a haptic deviant-figure detection task. Blind participants spontaneously used many geometric concepts such as parallelism, right angles and geometrical shapes to detect intruders in haptic displays, but experienced difficulties with symmetry and complex spatial transformations. Across items, their performance was highly correlated with that of sighted adults performing the same task in touch (blindfolded) and in vision, as well as with the performances of uneducated preschoolers and Amazonian adults. Our results support the existence of an amodal core-system of geometry that arises independently of visual experience. However, performance at selecting geometric intruders was generally higher in the visual compared to the haptic modality, suggesting that sensory-specific spatial experience may play a role in refining the properties of this core-system of geometry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

There is very limited knowledge about visual–motor integration (VMI) in people with WS. Method: Twenty-six participants with WS aged 6 to 41 years were assessed with all three tests of the Beery-VMI test, namely the VMI test, the visual perception test (VP) and the motor coordination test (MC). Their results were compared with those of 154 typically developing children (TD) aged 4 to 12. Results: No influence of age on the three tested abilities was found amongst the participants with WS in comparison with the TD children. The participants with WS scored similarly to the 5-year-old TD children in all three tasks; their scores on the VMI correlated with the results on the VP and MC tests, which were similar to those of the TD children. Finally, the scores on the non-verbal intelligence test (Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices) were highly predictive of the scores in the VMI and VP tests and partially explain the variance in the MC scores. Conclusions: The present study is the first to use all three tasks of the Beery-VMI test. For the TD children, the performances on the three subtests did not show the same developmental trajectory. In contrast, the participants with WS did not show the same developmental trajectory. The participants with WS exhibited poor performances on all tasks with scores comparable with the 5-year-old TD children. As high correlations between these abilities were observed, improving VP and MC could help the development of VMI, which in turn could improve visual–spatial abilities in individuals with WS. © 2016 MENCAP and International Association of the Scientific Study of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and John Wiley & Sons Ltd	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	https://doi.org/10.1076/chin.9.3.208.16456	This study focused on visual-sequential and visuo-spatial functions in a group of 39 heavily dyslexic children, compared to a Control group. Mean age was 12.72 (SD  1.71). The dyslexia group was divided into three subgroups by language comprehension  and mathematics skills. Only on a visual-sequential task was no difference seen  between the groups. The main differences occurred between the two dyslexic subgroups  with no language comprehension impairment, but with varying mathematics skills.  Whereas the subgroup with good mathematics skills scored within the upper ranges,  the mathematics-impaired subgroup showed significantly lower scores. The third  dyslexic subgroup, with both language comprehension and mathematics impairments,  performed within the norm. The study indicates a dissociation between language  comprehension and visuo-spatial skills in dyslexia, which has implications for how  variations in dyslexia should be understood. The results also show that the  visuo-spatial impairments seen in one of the dyslexia subgroups lead to two ways of  understanding mathematics impairment when it co-occurs with dyslexia: (1) as a  visuo-spatial problem; (2) as a linguistic problem. These distinctions should imply  different intervention strategies in dyslexia.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Dyslexia (Chichester, England)	https://doi.org/10.1002/dys.1515	The aim of this study was to find valid neurocognitive precursors of literacy development in first language (L1, Norwegian) and second language (L2, English) in a  group of children during their Pre-literacy, Emergent Literacy and Literacy stages,  by comparing children with dyslexia and a typical group. Children who were 5 years  old at project start were followed until the age of 11, when dyslexia was identified  and data could be analysed in retrospect. The children's neurocognitive pattern  changed both by literacy stage and domain. Visuo-spatial recall and RAN appeared as  early precursors of L1 literacy, while phonological awareness appeared as early  precursor of L2 English. Verbal long term memory was associated with both L1 and L2  skills in the Literacy stage. Significant group differences seen in the Pre-literacy  and Emergent literacy stages decreased in the Literacy stage. The developmental  variations by stage and domain may explain some of the inconsistencies seen in  dyslexia research. Early identification and training are essential to avoid academic  failure, and our data show that visuo-spatial memory and RAN could be suitable early  markers in transparent orthographies like Norwegian. Phonological awareness was here  seen as an early precursor of L2 English, but not of L1 Norwegian.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Methods Anonymized data sets from 279 pediatric epilepsy patients were standardized in regard to the KOPKIJ results of 352 healthy children and adolescents. The KOPKIJ was related to objective routine neuropsychological assessment (NPY), and to two subjective measures, the Child Behavior Checklist questionnaire (CBCL), a proxy rating by the parents, and a questionnaire for self-perceived health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (KINDL). Results Following principal component analysis of the KOPKIJ's normative data, three scales “basic functions”, “academic skills”, and a “total score” were differentiated, which indicated problems in 35%, 33%, and 32% of the children. Low IQ was evident in 23%, objective impairments in at least one major cognitive domain in 64% of the patients. Behavior (CBCL) and quality of life (KINDL) were impaired in 40% and 21% of the patients. Separate regression analyses revealed that objective cognitive performance (IQ, language, visual-spatial functions) explained ∼30%, behavior (CBCL) and coping with the disease (KINDL) about ∼40%, and clinical features (age at onset) 5–8% of the variance of the KOPKIJ scales. Conclusion The parents' impressions of children's cognition obtained via the KOPKIJ only in part reflect the neuropsychological cognitive status of children and adolescents with epilepsy. They appear rather determined by the children's behavioral problems, which in real life situations indeed often co-occur with cognitive impairments. Aspects of the epilepsy only marginally influence the parents’ ratings of their children's cognition. © 2017 British Epilepsy Association	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The focus is on the concept of representation as a theoretical foundation. The research design for collecting data of independent and dependent variables (map-based orientation competence, MBO), and the self-developed measuring instrument are explained. Altogether, 328 pupils of third, fourth, and fifth grade (aged 8-12 years) were tested. The orientation competence of children in strange spaces was slightly above the average, and grew with age. The most spectacular increase was detected on the transition from third to fourth grade. Additionally, boys scored higher than girls. The results also showed that along with age and gender, spatial intelligence (mental rotation) and previous knowledge shape MBO. A limited influence can be attributed to self-concept and previous experiences, while interest has no influence on MBO at all. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The literature regarding cognitive function surrounding the resection of frontal meningiomas is sparse. Methods We performed a prospective matched-control study to investigate the cognitive performance of frontal meningioma patients undergoing resection. The neurocognitive status 1 week and 2 months after resection was compared with the preoperative status and matched-controls. Matching was performed for age, sex, handedness, education, and profession. An extensive test battery was used to assess perceptual speed, executive function, visual-spatial and verbal working memory, short- and long-term memory, verbal fluency, fluid intelligence, anxiety, and depression. Results Twelve patients with frontal World Health Organization grade I meningioma and 12 matched-controls underwent cognitive testing. Macroscopically, complete removal was achieved in all cases. Comparison of patients and controls revealed significant cognitive impairments in perceptual speed, executive function, short-term memory, and verbal fluency preoperatively and postoperatively. At 2 months' follow-up, perceptual speed and verbal fluency were still significantly impaired, whereas executive function and short-term memory were equal to that in the control group. None of the patients experienced cognitive deterioration after surgical therapy. Conclusion Patients with frontal meningiomas display preoperative and postoperative deficits in perceptual speed, executive function, short-term memory, and verbal fluency. The risk for cognitive deterioration owing to surgical resection is low. Within the first two months after surgery, executive function and short-term memory appear to recover. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Cognition	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0010-0277(97)00029-2	Recent research indicates that 4- to 8-month-old infants can track and anticipate the final orientation of an object following different invisible spatial  transformations (Rochat, P., Hespos, S.J. (1996). Cognitive Development, 11, 3-17).  Six experiments were designed to specify further the nature and development of early  expectation for a set of dynamic events. A violation of expectation method was used  to assess infants' reactions to probable and improbable outcomes of an objects'  orientation following an invisible transformation. The availability of orientation  cues, the path of motion, and the amount of invisible spatial transformation was  systematically varied. The studies indicate that infants as young as 4 months of age  detect orientation-specific cues for objects undergoing invisible spatial  transformations. Developmental differences in this ability between 4 and 6 months of  age lend insight to the nature and limitations of this early representational  ability. These findings provide evidence for dynamic mental representation in  infancy.

The purpose of this study is to examine the early capacity to track invisible spatial transformations. In particular, we tested at what age infants could anticipate an object orientation following a partly occluded transformation. Method. In three experiments, 4- and 6-month-old infants were tested in a looking paradigm to assess their reaction to surreptitious changes in an object's orientation. The same procedure was used in all three experiments except the object and the size of the occluder were varied. Infants were familiarized to an object disappearing behind an occluder following either a translation (vertical fall), or a rotational motion (180° arc). The endpoint of both motions was occluded by a screen so that the final orientation of the object was not visible. In the translation condition, the object was presented at the top of the display and moved at a constant velocity 80 cm down a vertical track to the bottom of the display. In the rotation condition, the object moved at a constant velocity in a 180° arc from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock. Following familiarization, infants were shown six test trials. In the test trials, infants saw the object disappearing behind the occluder, then the occluder was removed. On alternating test trials, infants were presented with the object in the appropriate orientation outcome (possible orientation), or rotated by 180° (impossible orientation). Looking time at the revealed object was measured. Results. In the first experiment, 4- and 6-monih-old infants looked significantly longer at the impossible compared to the possible orientation outcome. In a second and third experiment, 6- but not 4-month-olds looked significantly longer at the impossible compared to the possible orientation outcome in a condition where the object afforded fewer orientation-specific cues (Exp. 2), and in a condition where a larger portion of the transformation was occluded (Exp. 3). Conclusions. These findings are interpreted as evidence of an early capacity to detect orientation-specific information. The results suggest that the ability to generate dynamic mental imagery is expressed by 4 months and develops rapidly.

In Experiment 1, 3.5-month-old infants saw a test event in which an object was lowered inside a container with either a wide opening (open-container condition) or no opening (closed-container condition) in its top surface. The infants looked reliably longer at the closed- than at the open-container test event. These and baseline data suggested that the infants recognized that the object could be lowered inside the container with the open but not the closed top. In Experiment 2, 3.5-month-old infants saw a test event in which an object was lowered either behind (behind-container condition) or inside (inside-container condition) a container; next, the container was moved forward and to the side, revealing the object behind it. The infants looked reliably longer at the inside- than at the behind-container test event. These and baseline results suggested that the infants in the inside-container condition realized that the object could not pass through the back wall of the container and hence should have moved with it to its new location. Experiments 3 and 4 extended the results of Experiments 1 and 2 to 2.5-month-old infants. Together, the present results indicate that even very young infants possess expectations about containment events. The possible origins and development of these expectations are discussed in the context of Baillargeon's model (Advances in infancy research 9 (1995) 305. Norwood, NJ: Ablex) of infants' acquisition of physical knowledge, and of Spelke's proposal (Cognition 50 (1994) 431) that, from birth, infants interpret physical events in accord with a solidity principle.

Here we investigated whether action tasks would reveal the same developmental pattern. Consistent with VOE reports, 5.5- and 6.5-month-old infants were more likely to reach for a toy that rested on as opposed to against a surface; and 6.5- but not 5.5-month-olds were more likely to reach for a toy with 100% as opposed to 15% of its bottom on a surface. Infants at each age thus used their support knowledge to determine whether the toys were likely to be retrievable or to be attached to adjacent surfaces and hence irretrievable. These and control findings extend recent evidence that developmental patterns observed in VOE tasks also hold in action tasks, and as such provide further support for the view that VOE and action tasks tap the same physical knowledge.

When a moving object is temporarily hidden by darkness or occlusion, 6-month-old infants’ reaching is perturbed, but performance on darkness trials is significantly better than occlusion trials. How does this reaching behavior change over development? Experiment 1 tested predictive reaching of 6- and 9-month-old infants. While there was an increase in the overall number of reaches with increasing age, there were significantly fewer predictive reaches during the occlusion compared to visible trials and no age-related changes in this pattern. The decrease in performance found in Experiment 1 is likely to apply not only to the object representations formed by infants but also those formed by adults. In Experiment 2 we tested adults with a similar reaching task. Like infants, the adults were most accurate when the target was continuously visible and performance in darkness trials was significantly better than occlusion trials, providing evidence that there is something specific about occlusion that makes it more difficult than merely lack of visibility. Together, these findings suggest that infants’ and adults’ capacities to represent objects have similar signatures throughout development.	SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		AE	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		5	5	1	NA	5	0	0	1

Such a relationship is of scientific interest to scholars of modularity and transfer of learning, because music and spatial reasoning might be related psychologically (i.e., they may rely on some of the same underlying skills) and perhaps neurologically as well (i.e., they may rely on some of the same, or proximal, brain areas). A relationship between the two abilities also could have practical implications for education, perhaps leading to instruction that better develops spatial ability, which is important to many disciplines and professions (e.g., physics, archaeology, medicine, engineering). Through meta-analysis (including analyses exploring potentially influential moderator variables), this thesis summarizes two bodies of experimental literature that have explored this relationship. Chapter 2 analyzes the temporary enhancing effects on adults' (college students') performance on spatial tasks (i.e., tasks requiring mental manipulation of shapes) after listening briefly to music (popularly called the “Mozart effect”). This review demonstrates a non-trivial effect for a particular category of spatial task, spatial-temporal (i.e., mentally flipping and turning objects in the absence of a physical model). The effect is of moderate size and generalizes broadly, but the mechanism remains uncertain. Further research is recommended. Chapter 3 analyzes the effects on performance of similar spatial tasks for children ages 3–12 that resulted from participating actively (not just listening) in programs of music instruction (the “music-making effect”). This second set of reviews shows a large, stable effect that also generalizes broadly. The effect was demonstrated for spatial-temporal measures and for mixed spatial measures that require mental manipulation of shapes, but not for Raven's Matrices tasks. Contrary to expectations, keyboard programs were not more effective than typical programs of music instruction in which children respond actively by making music in a variety of ways. However, learning notation did increase effect sizes. Cautious interpretation for educational practice is suggested because it is not clear how long the effect lasts, enhanced spatial abilities may not have much impact on school success, and justifying music programs based on their “bonus” effects may distract educators from important goals of music instruction.

The fine control task demanded three five-second contractions at three levels alternating with four second rest periods. Two two-minute relaxation periods, one with and one without biofeedback, but with an attentional focus, alternated with the fine control task. Clear developmental differences were found in performance on the fine control task, whatever the analysis employed, unlike the relaxation task where children made greater gains than adults and the developmental pattern identified depended on the method of analysis used. A high level of inter subject variation was found in all ages on both tasks. EMG biofeedback was shown to be effective for adult subjects (and possibly all ages) on the fine control task and for children aged 6.6-10.7 years on the relaxation task. Settling-down and low motivation without biofeedback could explain significant results in the 4.5-6.5 year olds and adults respectively. Improved performance over sessions in the fine control task; lack of relationship between performances on the two tasks and good retention and reminiscence in the relaxation task indicated that EMG biofeedback with the frontalis muscles might operate in a way analogous to that in which motor skills are acquired. Lower levels of resting tone in the frontalis muscles of adult males than adult females, with and without biofeedback, could have resulted from the adoption of somatic strategies by males and cognitive strategies by females while relaxing. No other sex differences were reported. Spatial ability, measured by performance on two tasks involving left/right reversals, was unrelated to performance on the biofeedback tasks. Therefore, tests which could be used as predictors of biofeedback performance were unlikely to be identified.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

International journal of language & communication disorders	https://doi.org/10.1080/13682820400011507	BACKGROUND: The study is concerned with the cognitive abilities of children with specific language impairment (SLI). Previous research has indicated that children  with SLI demonstrate difficulties with certain cognitive tasks despite normal  non-verbal IQ scores. It has been suggested that a general processing limitation  might account for the pattern of language and cognitive difficulties seen in  children with SLI. The performances on a visuo-spatial short-term memory task and a  visuo-spatial processing task were considered in a group of young children with SLI.  Verbal short-term memory was also measured. AIMS: To identify whether children with  SLI demonstrate difficulties with visuo-spatial memory as well as verbal short-term  memory. To see whether a visuo-spatial processing task without short-term memory  requirements is problematic for children with SLI. To consider performance on these  tasks over time. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Nine children with SLI (mean age 3;9 years  at the study outset) and nine typically developing children (mean age 3;9 years at  the study outset) were visited on three occasions over 1 year. Verbal short-term  memory, visuo-spatial short-term memory and visuo-spatial processing tasks were  administered to the children, and performance over time was compared between the two  groups. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The children with SLI performed at a lower level than  the typically developing children on the verbal short-term memory task. Both groups  showed similar development on the verbal short-term memory task and the  visuo-spatial processing task over time. Only the visuo-spatial short-term memory  task showed slower development over time in the children with SLI relative to the  typically developing children. CONCLUSIONS: Children with SLI demonstrated slower  development on a visuo-spatial short-term memory task relative to typically  developing children of the same chronological age. This finding has implications for  speech and language therapists and other professionals working with children with  SLI. It may mean that only certain types of visual support are suitable, and that  children with SLI will have difficulty with tasks requiring a high level of  processing, or a number of mental manipulations.

Route choice is conceptualized as a game played upon an urban street system viewed as a graph. Completing a walk requires the sequential selection of edges from those available in the graph. Each sequence of choices is called a strategy. This study is an investigation of the characteristics of strategies employed by pedestrians in their selection of routes from one place to another.    Data were collected in Lincoln, Nebraska. Two hundred pedestrians were intercepted, tracked to their destinations, and handed mail-in questionnaires which asked each subject to describe the route of the walking trip just completed. Eighty-three subjects (86% of those who returned questionnaires) responded with accurate description of the tracked portions of their trips. One hundred additional pedestrians were intercepted and asked for directions to the nearest elementary school. Finally, fifty elementary school children were also individually tracked on their way home from school.    Data analysis employed the following classifications and measures. Classifications for trip networks and trip types were developed. Standardized measures of spatial structure (simple-complex dimension) and route choice (freedom-determinancy dimension) were also devised. Both measures are adaptations of the formula for standardized scores (Z-scores).    The following hypotheses were empirically corroborated:  (1) pedestrians nearly always choose distance-minimizing routes, (2) young pedestrians select relatively more complex routes than adults, (3) a stranger who asks for directions generally receives structurally simple routes, and (4) adult pedestrians exhibit more complexity in their own walking routes compared to the complexity of routes given to a stranger asking for directions.    It was also hypothesized (5) that women select less complex routes than men. The exact opposite was discovered. Women are experienced, knowledgeable pedestrians who often complete longer trips than men.    Whether a "strategy" framework is experientially relevant to pedestrians remains an open question for future research.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Evidence concerning more sophisticated survey learning has been sparse. In the research reported here, two experiments are reported that evaluated survey learning of youth with DS and typically developing children (TD) matched on mental age. In Experiment 1, participants learned two overlapping routes consisting of three turns each through a virtual environment depicting 9 square city blocks. Following acquisition, they were tested on multiple measures of survey knowledge: finding a shortcut, identifying the direction of landmarks not currently visible from their location in the environment, and recognizing a bird’s-eye representation of the overall environment. Under these conditions, which should provide relatively optimal opportunities for survey learning, the participants with DS performed comparably to TD participants matched on non-verbal ability on all of our measures of survey learning. Hence, we concluded that people with DS can acquire some survey knowledge when tasked with learning a small environment and given the opportunity to do so. In Experiment 2, the experimenter navigated participants through a large, relatively complex, virtual environment along a circuitous path, beginning and ending at a target landmark. Then, the participants were placed at a pre-specified location in the environment that they had viewed previously and instructed to navigate to the same target (a door) using the shortest possible path from their current location. They completed the task three times: once after being shown the environment one time, once after three exposures, and once after five exposures. Results indicated that the participants with DS exhibited significantly less skill at identifying the shortcut than did the TD participants, with differences emerging as the number of exposures increased. Participants with DS were also less able to recall landmarks at the end of the experiment. Overall, however, the performance of both groups was relatively poor in both experiments – with the performance of participants with DS being worse as conditions became less optimal. These results were discussed in terms of underlying mechanisms that may account for variations in survey learning as environmental complexity increases. © 2020 Himmelberger, Merrill, Conners, Roskos, Yang and Robinson.

database	Hines, M.	2006	journalArticle	Prenatal testosterone and gender-related behaviour	European Journal of Endocrinology, Supplement	https://doi.org/10.1530/eje.1.02236	Testosterone plays an important role in mammalian brain development. In neural regions with appropriate receptors testosterone, or its metabolites, influences patterns of cell death and survival, neural connectivity and neurochemical characterization. Consequently, testosterone exposure during critical periods of early development produces permanent behavioural changes. In humans, affected behaviours include childhood play behaviour, sexual orientation, core gender identity and other characteristics that show sex differences (i.e. differ on average between males and females). These influences have been demonstrated primarily in individuals who experienced marked prenatal hormone abnormalities and associated ambiguities of genital development (e.g. congenital adrenal hyperplasia). However, there is also evidence that testosterone works within the normal range to make some individuals within each sex more sex-typical than others. The size of testosterone-related influences, and perhaps even their existence, varies from one sex-typed characteristic to another. For instance: prenatal exposure to high levels of testosterone has a substantial influence on sex-typical play behaviour, including sex-typed toy preferences, whereas influences on core gender identify and sexual orientation are less dramatic. In addition: there appears to be little or no influence of prenatal testosterone on mental rotations ability, although mental rotations ability shows a marked sex difference. These findings have implications for basic understanding of the role of testosterone in normative gender development, as well as for the clinical management of individuals with disorders of sex development (formerly called intersex syndromes). © 2006 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.

In the current study, the hypothesis that androgen influences the development of human spatial abilities was investigated. Participants included 40 females and 29 males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a genetic disorder that causes overproduction of adrenal androgens beginning prenatally, and 29 unaffected female and 30 unaffected male relatives of individuals with CAH. Participants ranged in age from 12-45 years. Measures of spatial abilities included two mental rotations tasks and two targeting tasks, all of which showed large sex differences favoring males in the unaffected relative controls. Females with CAH (exposed to higher than normal levels of androgen prenatally) performed better than unaffected females on the targeting tasks, and resembled unaffected males and males with CAH in this respect. However, females with CAH did not perform better than unaffected females on the measures of mental rotations abilities. Males with CAH showed unaltered performance on the targeting tasks, and impaired performance on the mental rotations tasks. Results are discussed in terms of differences in experiential and hormonal contributions to different spatial abilities, as well as in terms of possible differences in critical periods for hormonal influences on targeting versus mental rotations abilities. Specifically, we speculate that, although androgen may influence targeting abilities prenatally, if hormones influence the development of mental rotations ability, they do so at some other time, perhaps during the first six months of postnatal life. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.07.018	Human gender-related behavior/psychology is shaped by a developmental system that involves numerous influences interacting over time. Understanding of the full range  of elements in the system and how they interact is currently incomplete. The  available evidence suggests, however, that early exposure to testosterone, postnatal  socialization, e.g., by parents and peers, and self-socialization related to  cognitive understanding of gender are important elements. This article focuses on  prenatal and early neonatal influences of testosterone on gender-related  psychological/behavioral outcomes, and contextualizes these hormonal influences  within an understanding of socialization influences. There is consistent evidence  that early testosterone exposure influences childhood gender role behavior,  including sex-typical toy play, as well as gender identity and sexual orientation.  Evidence for similar hormonal influences on spatial ability and on traits related to  autism, or autistic spectrum disorder, is inconsistent. Evidence from girls exposed  to elevated testosterone prenatally suggests that they experience alterations in  processes of external socialization, as well as self-socialization, and that these,  along with early testosterone exposure, shape gender-related outcomes.

Down's syndrome, research and practice : the journal of the Sarah Duffen Centre		This pilot study was designed to examine mental rotation ability in individuals with Down syndrome. 7 individuals with Down syndrome (mean mental age = 8.18 +/- 2.73  years; mean chronological age = 29.8 +/- 5.4 years) and a group of 9 typically  developing children, matched for mental age, (mean mental age = 8.40 +/- 1.73 years;  mean chronological age = 7.2 +/- 1.2 years) were given a version of Cooper and  Shepherd's (1973) mental rotation paradigm. On each trial, participants viewed a  symbol representing an upper case 'F' or a mirror image of an 'F'. The symbol was  presented at one of eight different orientations. The participant's task was to  determine whether the letter was reversed or non-reversed. Interestingly, both  groups showed similar trends in increased reaction times with increasing angular  disparity, suggesting that both groups were performing mental rotations. There was  no significant difference in reaction time between the typically developing and Down  syndrome groups, however, the Down syndrome group made significantly more errors  than the typically developing group. Participants with Down syndrome were able to  carry out the mental rotations at well above chance level and mental rotation  ability was shown to correlate with mental age.

Dissociation, and its most severe pathological manifestation, Multiple Personality Disorder, or MPD (newly renamed Dissociative Identity Disorder, or DID), are re-emerging, after 50 years of disbelief and neglect, as widely recognized responses to overwhelming trauma.    It is not known why some abused children develop MPD and others do not. Some believe that there are abilities or deficiencies that are a part of the formula. It was proposed in this study that a high degree of visual-spatialization might be an ability which allows or reflects the complex internal ego states seemingly required by MPD. The hypothesis was that abused adolescents with a high level of visual-spatial ability will have a higher degree of dissociation than abused adolescents with a low level of visual-spatial ability.    A step-wise multiple regression of dissociation on visual-spatial ability was conducted, controlling for the effects of an estimate of verbal ability (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised), ethnicity (Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic) and diagnosis (psychotic vs. non-psychotic). The reverse of the hypothesis was found--with an increase in visual-spatial ability, there is a decrease in the level of dissociation.    Further analysis of the data revealed that there is a negative relationship between dissociation and visual-spatial ability in the participating adolescents who had a diagnosis of psychosis, but not in those without.    Possible interpretations of this phenomenon and supplemental information are explored. Limitations of this study and directions for future research are presented.

Frontiers in human neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00856	Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder caused by the partial deletion of chromosome 7. Individuals with WS have atypical cognitive abilities, such as  hypersociability and compromised visuospatial cognition, although the mechanisms  underlying these deficits, as well as the relationship between them, remain unclear.  Here, we assessed performance in mental rotation (MR) and level 2 visual perspective  taking (VPT2) tasks in individuals with and without WS. Individuals with WS obtained  lower scores in the VPT2 task than in the MR task. These individuals also performed  poorly on both the MR and VPT2 tasks compared with members of a control group. For  the individuals in the control group, performance scores improved during development  for both tasks, while the scores of those in the WS group improved only in the MR  task, and not the VPT2 task. Therefore, we conducted a second experiment to explore  the specific cognitive challenges faced by people with WS in the VPT2 task. In  addition to asking participants to change their physical location (self-motion), we  also asked them to adopt a third-person perspective by imagining that they had moved  to a specified location (self-motion imagery). This enabled us to assess their  ability to simulate the movement of their own bodies. The performance in the control  group improved in both the self-motion and self-motion imagery tasks and both  performances were correlated with verbal mental age. However, we did not find any  developmental changes in performance for either task in the WS group. Performance  scores for the self-motion imagery task in the WS group were low, similar to the  scores observed for the VPT2 in this population. These results suggest that MR and  VPT2 tasks involve different processes, and that these processes develop differently  in people with WS. Moreover, difficulty completing VPT2 tasks may be partly because  of an inability of people with WS to accurately simulate mental body motion.	SK	0	0	0	1	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		4	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

Performance of a mental toy rotation task and a self-motion (SM) task (changing  location of children) was superior to that of VPT2 and SMI tasks. Task performance  of SMI was better than that of VPT2 before 10;0 (years;months). Furthermore,  egocentric responses in VPT2 and SMI tasks were significantly more frequent than  those in the mental rotation and SM tasks before 10;3. These findings suggest the  involvement of embodied cognitive processes in perspective taking and the advantage  of utilizing bodily information by age 10.

There seems to be, however, a growing awareness among researchers who study spatial perspective-taking (PT) that the ability to infer another's visual percepts is a much more complex, social cognitive skill (e.g., Flavell, 1977). Several researchers have suggested that the results of spatial PT studies seem to be more a function of task complexity and response requirements than they are a function of egocentric thought (Borke, 1975; Eliot & Dayton, 1976). The primary objective of the present research was to examine an alternative explanation of the PT construct. The purpose was to clarify the relationship between spatial PT and two established factors of spatial ability, spatial orientation and spatial visualization. A second major emphasis of the present research was to focus on the effects of methodological variations that influence results on spatial PT performance. A total of sixty-four 11-year-olds served as participants. Spatial PT was examined as a function of stimulus arrangement, response mode, position of inference (90(DEGREES), 180(DEGREES), 270(DEGREES)), gender, spatial orientation, and spatial visualization. Spatial ability was not a significant predictor of performance on the spatial PT task. The cognitive operations that underlie spatial PT within a range of task conditions do not seem to be mediated by spatial orientation or spatial visualization skills. On the other hand, results lend support to the position that spatial PT performance is a complex skill that is significantly influenced by contextual variables and task demands. There were strong separate effects due to stimulus arrangement, response mode, and the position from which inferences are made about another observer's perspectives. Further, there were no significant effects due to gender differences on the spatial PT task or on either of the spatial ability tests. Thus, the data indicate that the spatial PT task requires additional cognitive operations beyond social inferential distinctions.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Methods: Subjects were selected based on their deletion status determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a panel of 24 BACs and cosmids spanning the region commonly deleted and single gene analysis using Southern blotting. From the cohort of subjects, three had atypical deletions. Physical examinations and cognitive tests were administered to the three subjects and the results were compared to those from a cohort of typical WS subjects. Results: The molecular results indicate smaller deletions for each subject. In all three cases, typical Williams facies were absent and visual spatial abilities were above that of full deletion WS subjects, particularly in the qualitative aspects of visual spatial processing. Conclusions: Combining the molecular analysis with the cognitive results suggest that the genes GTF2IRD1 and GTF2I contribute to deficits on visual spatial functioning.

In education, virtual presence is a significant construct as highly immersive VREs have been linked to users reporting memorable and exciting teaching experiences. Prior research has described that adults and children report different levels of presence when subjected to identical VREs, suggesting cognition may play some role in users’ perceptions of presence. According to Piaget, concrete operational development is a watershed moment when adolescents develop the ability to understand abstract concepts and make assessments what is and is not reality. This period in cognitive development may influence children’s and adolescents’ perceptions of presence. This is an exploratory study of seventy-five 6th-grade and seventy-six 9th-grade students who participated in an instructional module about cardiac anatomy and physiology using a 3-D, haptic-enabled, VR technology. When surveyed on their perceptions of virtual presence, there were no reported differences between grade levels. When assessed using a Piagetian inventory of cognitive development, the analyses indicated that the sixth-grade students’ understanding of spatial rotation and angular geometry was positively correlated with the reported perceived control and negatively correlated with distraction. This study suggests that the spatial acuity of younger learners plays an important role when using VR technologies for science learning. This research raises questions about the relevance of users’ cognitive development when using emergent VR technologies in the K–12 science classroom. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

Because previous adoption studies have usually obtained little or no data for birth fathers, estimates of heritability have been based entirely upon the correlation between the birth mothers and their adopted children. These estimates, however, may be inflated if the birth parents mate assortatively, since the parent-offspring correlation is a function of mate correlation. Thus, the degree that birth parents mate assortatively can influence estimates of genetic parameters in adoption studies. Similarly, the extent to which adoptive parents marry assortatively will influence estimates of environmental parameters in adoption studies. For these reasons the degree of spouse similarity was examined in birth parents, adoptive parents, and control parents who participated in the Colorado Adoption Project.    Spouse correlations for age, physical traits, specific cognitive abilities, personality, and other behavioral variables were examined. The largest correlation was for age. Smaller, but significant, mate correlations were found for education, performance on tests of verbal ability, and habits such as alcohol consumption and current smoking behavior. In general, spouses were not similar with respect to physical traits, personality characteristics, or performance on several tests of perceptual speed, memory, and spatial ability.    Assortative mating across traits influences the genetic covariation among traits in a population and the cross correlations among relatives. Assortative mating across traits was examined for measures within as well as between the cognition and personality domains. Results from a principal factor analysis of spouse cross correlations for specific cognitive abilities indicated an underlying dimension of covariation among the cross-trait assortative mating coefficients. The first principal factor (unrotated) accounted for 40% (averaged across the birth, adoptive, and control parents) of the variance.    Because "assortative mating" may differ from "assortative marriage," comparisons among estimates of homogamy for birth, adoptive, and control parents were made. Results of these analyses indicated no differential assortment among the three types of parents for most of the variables examined.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Allan Hobson provides a harrowing yet moving personal perspective on his own "journey of the self." In February of 2001, Dr. Hobson suffered a brain stem stroke. Approximately 5 months after partial recovery from this first neurological insult, due to the combined effects of pneumonia, cardiac failure, and adverse drug reactions, Hobson went into a hallucinatory delirium. His description of this period is simultaneously fascinating and frightening and provides a marvelous window into the manner in which the mind and self can be transformed by the brain's metabolic milieu. Upon reflection Hobson concludes that in spite of his mental transformation during the time of his illness, the nature of his experiences and his ability to describe and understand them speaks to the resilience and durability of the self in the face of the ravages of neurological illness. © 2005 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

Cerebellum (London, England)	https://doi.org/10.1007/s12311-018-0983-9	Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive, multisystem disease causing cerebellar ataxia, mucocutaneous telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, and  malignancies. A pilot study reported cognitive and behavioral manifestations  characteristic of the cerebellar cognitive affective / Schmahmann syndrome (CCAS).  We set out to test and further define these observations because a more  comprehensive understanding of the spectrum of impairments in AT is essential for  optimal management. Twenty patients (12 males; 9.86 ± 5.5 years, range 4.3 to 23.2)  were grouped by age: AT-I (toddlers and preschoolers, n = 7, 4.3-5.9 years), AT-II  (school children, n = 7, 5.9-9.8 years), AT-III (adolescents/young adults, n = 6,  12.6-23.2 years). Standard and experimental tests investigated executive,  linguistic, visual-spatial, and affective/social-cognitive domains. Results were  compared to standard norms and healthy controls. Cognitive changes in AT-I were  limited to mild visual-spatial disorganization. Spatial deficits were greater in  AT-II, with low average scores on executive function (auditory working memory),  expressive language (vocabulary), academic abilities (math, spelling, reading),  social cognition (affect recognition from faces), and emotional/psychological  processing. Full Scale IQ scores were low average to borderline impaired. AT-III  patients had the greatest level of deficits which were evident particularly in  spatial skills, executive function (auditory working memory, sequencing, word/color  interference, set-shifting, categorization errors, perseveration), academic  achievement, social cognition (affect recognition from faces), and behavioral  control. Full Scale IQ scores in this group fell in the impaired range, while  language was borderline impaired for comprehension, and low average for expression.  Cognitive deficits in AT at a young age are mild and limited to visual-spatial  functions. More widespread cognitive difficulties emerge with age and disease  progression, impacting executive function, spatial skills, affect, and social  cognition. Linguistic processing remains mildly affected. Recognition of the CCAS in  children with AT may facilitate therapeutic interventions to improve quality of  life.

Prior research with adults indicates that spatial thinking skills predict science learning outcomes. However, research in the primary school years is sparse and includes a restricted range of spatial thinking and science measures. The main aim of this thesis was to comprehensively investigate the relationship between spatial thinking skills and science learning in middle childhood (7-11 years). Children completed a selection of spatial thinking tasks and science assessments, across varying contexts. Spatial thinking skills predicted performance on a curriculum-based science assessment (Chapter 3). Mental folding and spatial scaling were the strongest predictors, with mental folding a stronger predictor than spatial scaling. Spatial thinking skills also predicted the learning outcomes of whole-class instruction on sound (Chapter 4). Mental folding again emerged as the strongest spatial predictor. The relationship was evident for tasks involving the application of conceptual understanding, rather than factual recall. An additional aim was to investigate gesture as a spatial tool in supporting children's science learning. No strong evidence emerged that gesture was a more effective spatial learning tool than teaching via the use of concrete models, or by using verbal descriptions and diagrams (Chapter 5). Consistent with Chapter 3 and 4, mental folding also predicted learning. However, for problems closely related to the lesson content, this relationship was stronger in the conditions where children had no experience with concrete models. This may reflect the use of mental models to scaffold learning. Despite evidence for certain spatial skills being stronger predictors of science learning, psychometric analyses best supported a one-factor model of spatial thinking. Nevertheless, the findings of the thesis suggest that targeting mental folding skills within spatial training interventions may yield the greatest benefits.

The British journal of developmental psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjdp.12380	The multidimensional structure of spatial ability remains a debated issue. However, the developmental trajectories of spatial skills have yet to be investigated as a  source of evidence within this debate. We tested the intrinsic versus extrinsic and  static versus dynamic dimensions of the Uttal et al. (2013, Psychol. Bull., 139,  352) typology in relation to spatial development. Participants (N = 184) aged 6-11  completed spatial tasks chosen to measure these spatial dimensions. The results  indicated that the developmental trajectories of intrinsic versus extrinsic skills  differed significantly. Intrinsic skills improved more between 6 and 8 years, and 7  and 8 years, than extrinsic skills. Extrinsic skills increased more between 8 and  10 years than intrinsic skills. The trajectories of static versus dynamic skills did  not differ significantly. The findings support the intrinsic versus extrinsic, but  not the static versus dynamic dimension, of the Uttal et al. (2013, Psychol. Bull.,  139, 352) typology.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

C.; Farran, Emily K.	2018	journalArticle	Spatial cognition and science achievement: The contribution of intrinsic and extrinsic spatial skills from 7 to 11 years.	The British journal of educational psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12211	BACKGROUND: Prior longitudinal and correlational research with adults and adolescents indicates that spatial ability is a predictor of science learning and  achievement. However, there is little research to date with primary-school aged  children that addresses this relationship. Understanding this association has the  potential to inform curriculum design and support the development of early  interventions. AIMS: This study examined the relationship between primary-school  children's spatial skills and their science achievement. METHOD: Children aged  7-11 years (N = 123) completed a battery of five spatial tasks, based on a model of  spatial ability in which skills fall along two dimensions: intrinsic-extrinsic;  static-dynamic. Participants also completed a curriculum-based science assessment.  RESULTS: Controlling for verbal ability and age, mental folding (intrinsic-dynamic  spatial ability), and spatial scaling (extrinsic-static spatial ability) each  emerged as unique predictors of overall science scores, with mental folding a  stronger predictor than spatial scaling. These spatial skills combined accounted for  8% of the variance in science scores. When considered by scientific discipline,  mental folding uniquely predicted both physics and biology scores, and spatial  scaling accounted for additional variance in biology and variance in chemistry  scores. The children's embedded figures task (intrinsic-static spatial ability) only  accounted for variance in chemistry scores. The patterns of association were  consistent across the age range. CONCLUSION: Spatial skills, particularly mental  folding, spatial scaling, and disembedding, are predictive of 7- to 11-year-olds'  science achievement. These skills make a similar contribution to performance for  each age group.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of ERT (estrogens only) or HRT (estrogens combined with a progestagen) in comparison with placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on cognitive function in postmenopausal women. SEARCH STRATEGY: The CDCIG Specialized Register was searched using the terms ORT, PORT, ERT, HRT, estrogen*, oestrogen*, progesteron* on 16 May 2002. In addition MEDLINE (1966-2002/01); EMBASE (1985-2000/11); PsycINFO (1967-2002/01) and CINAHL (1982-2001/12) were searched as the CDCIG Register does not contain all trials with healthy volunteers. SELECTION CRITERIA: All double-blind randomized controlled trials of the effect of ERT or HRT on cognitive function over a treatment period of at least two weeks in postmenopausal women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Abstracts of the references retrieved by the searches were read by two reviewers in order to discard those that were clearly not eligible for inclusion. The two reviewers studied the full text of the remaining references and independently selected studies for inclusion. Any disparity in the resulting lists was resolved by discussion with all reviewers in order to arrive at the final list of included studies. The selection criteria ensured that the blinding and randomization of the included studies was adequate. Two reviewers (EH and KY) assessed the quality of other aspects including design and assessment of outcomes. One reviewer (EH) extracted the data from the studies. MAIN RESULTS: In total, 15 trials involving 566 postmenopausal women were included, but 6 studies did not have adequate data for analysis. Meta-analyses showed a positive effect of 10 mg of estradiol (E2) bolus injections intramuscularly monthly in relatively young surgically menopausal women on the Paired Associate learning test immediate recall (z=2.40, p<0.05, chi-square test=1.12, p=0.29, SMD=1.02, 95% C.I.=0.19-1.85), on a test of abstract reasoning (z=10.45, p<0.0001, WMD=6.80, 95% C.I.=5.52-8.08) and a test of speed and accuracy (z=9.16, p<0.0001 WMD=6.00, 95% C.I.=4.72-7.28). However, most studies showed no evidence of an effect on verbal or visuospatial memory, mental rotations, speed or accuracy measures. There was little evidence that Premarin, the most widely prescribed estrogen for postmenopausal use, had positive effects on cognitive function. The one effect of 9 months of treatment with Premarin (and a progestagen) on a measure of complex speed of information processing (the TMT-B) was probably explained by baseline differences, as it was not reported by the authors. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There was little evidence regarding the effect HRT or ERT on overall cognitive function in healthy postmenopausal women. There was an effect on some verbal memory functions (immediate recall), on a test of abstract reasoning and a test of speed and accuracy in relatively young (47 years of age) surgically menopausal women who had been given a bolus intramuscular injection of 10 mg E2 every month for 3 months. These effects were from small studies from a single research group. It remains to be determined whether factors such as an older age (> 69 years of age), type of menopause (surgical or natural) and type of treatment (E2 with or without a progestagen), mode of delivery (transdermal, oral or intramuscular), dosage and duration (> 3 months) could alter the effect on memory functions to a clinically relevant level. In addition, whether the absence or presence of menopausal symptoms can modify treatment effects should be investigated in more detail. Longitudinal RCTs currently underway in the U.S.A., U.K. and Canada will be able to test these hypotheses by the year 2010.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	2	2	0	0	1

This form of media is now popular with children, adolescents, and adults alike. While most early research on the effects of VGP focused on the relation of violence in video games and expressions of aggression, more recent research has begun to explore possible beneficial effects of VGP. Study results have been inconsistent, with some suggesting that VGP may improve various cognitive skills such as spatial skills, attentional skills, executive control, and problem solving. Other studies refute or qualify these findings. Additionally, different types of games have been related to improvements in differing cognitive skills. A lack of consistency in VGP training programs and an abundance of correlational rather than causational studies have made interpretation of VGP training results murky at best. The current study aimed to clarify possible causal relationships between VGP and changes in cognitive skill. Novice game players were trained on two different VGP genres (strategy and action-shooter) and administered pre- and post-test batteries of cognitive skill. Forty-nine female participants played 20 hours of a randomly assigned video-game over the course of ten weeks and completed multiple cognitive skills tests pre- and post-study. Individuals who played the first-person shooter-style game exhibited significant improvements in attention, working memory, visuospatial skills, processing speed, and problem-solving. Individuals playing the strategy style game demonstrated significant improvements in working memory, problem-solving, and visuospatial skills as well. Both groups exhibited a decline in self-reported willingness to engage in social conversation following the training paradigm but no cognitive skill declines were observed. These findings have implications for the utility of commercial video-games as a cognitive skill building tool. They also support the potential efficacy of electronic media as a potentially useful means of addressing cognitive deficits while also remaining highly engaging and motivating for individuals to utilize.

Both acute and chronic metabolic abnormalities relate to poorer neuropsychological functioning in the areas of information processing speed, visual spatial ability, and memory. Children with IDDM demonstrate lower intellectual functioning than controls with some subgroups at greater risk than others. Poorer metabolic control including both recurrent hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemia, earlier age of disease onset, and longer disease duration are related to lower IQ scores. Lower academic achievement scores also are found, and a substantial proportion of children with diabetes have received special school services, especially those children from the higher risk groups. Neurodevelopmentally, boys rather than girls are at greater risk for learning problems, and gender effects are magnified with diabetes. Poorer metabolic control is consistently associated with lower SES groups, and boys from lower SES families have clinically lower IQ scores.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1
database	Holmes, S.; Hallam, S.	2017	journalArticle	The impact of participation in music on learning mathematics	London Review of Education	https://doi.org/10.18546/LRE.15.3.07	Music psychologists have established that some forms of musical activity improve intellectual performance, spatial–temporal reasoning and other skills advantageous for learning. In this research, the potential of active music-making for improving pupils’ achievement in spatial– temporal reasoning was investigated. As spatial–temporal skills are considered to be high-level mathematical abilities, this study also aimed to explore if learning music might have an effect on pupils’ achievement in mathematics, and whether spatial–temporal reasoning plays a role in this process. The study had a quasi-experimental design in which groups of children aged 4 to 7 participated in a music programme containing a variety of musical, predominantly rhythmical, activities. Parallel classes made up control groups. Throughout the intervention, pupils’ attainment in mathematics, reading, writing and spatial–temporal reasoning was recorded and compared between the music and control groups. The findings of the project supported the hypothesis that music instruction has an impact on the development of spatial–temporal skills. A statistically significantly greater progression was observed in most of the intervention groups, as compared in all periods of measurement to the control groups. The attainment in general mathematics did not always differ between the intervention and control groups but the analyses provided evidence of a consistent and statistically significant enhancement in learning mathematics between the youngest participants of the programme. This knowledge could inform pedagogical practice, while further research in this area could offer more insight into the association between music and mathematics. © 2017 Holmes and Hallam.

Intercorrelations of the various measures were calculated, and a bi-factor analysis of the correlations made, for estimation of the 2 orthogonal factors, general ability and spatial ability. For geometry, the full battery had high predictive value, the tests of the general factor contributing much, those of the spatial factor relatively little. The general factor had higher predictive value than the IQ for all school subjects except English. The predictive value of the spatial factor was high for drawing and crafts, but low or negligible for other school subjects.

Effective content design is crucial to the success of digital game-based learning. Therefore, the tool for assessing the effectiveness of game design is accordingly very important for parents and teachers, so that they may encourage or discourage students to play. The purpose of this study is to develop an assessment tool to examine the educational values of digital games. In the first phase of this research, the research team developed the indices for assessing the educational values of digital games. An expert panel consisting of game scholars and professional game designers was established to construct the indices for evaluating digital games in three focus group discussions. Seventy-four game evaluation indices were sorted into seven categories: mentality change, emotional fulfilment, knowledge enhancement, thinking skill development, interpersonal skill development, spatial ability development and bodily coordination. In the second phase of the research, the game designers were asked to assess certain games by using the 74 indices. Meanwhile, the game scholars were also asked to evaluate the same pool of games by the same indices. The assessments by both the scholars and designers were then compared and the similarities were found. This research provided a preliminary framework for future game designers, parents and teachers in assessing educational values of digital games. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

database	Honour, Lesley Anne	2020	thesis	Children's Mental Representation of Number, Their Number Line Estimations and Maths Achievement : Exploring the Role of 3d Mental Rotation Skills		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/childrens-mental-representation-number-their-line/docview/2430752652/se-2?accountid=11531	As children’s early grasp of number is a reliable indicator of their future mathematical competence, any internal representations they develop to encode conceptual understanding, or as a framework for problem solving, are of particular interest to researchers. Although the exact nature and form of these mental models are difficult to establish, prior research has identified a directional left to right number line as the most probable internal representational schema for number magnitude. However, the extent to which these types of mental representations influence maths achievement is not clear, as there has yet to be a systematic review of the literature evidencing such links. This review set out to systematically gather, and critically examine, findings in one small area of a potentially large field of research; specifically the relationship between children’s mental representation of number magnitude and early maths achievement. Ten studies met the criterion for inclusion, each exploring the influence of mental representations through correlational data, or through training designed to enhance any such internal symbolic framework. Results indicate that internal representations of number are important for mathematical competence particularly in the early years, as notation and calculation with integers becomes increasingly symbolic. Implications for EPs were discussed including best approaches that model and encourage precision of the mental number line, such as linear board games, and awareness of specific groups that are most likely to benefit from any such intervention. Number magnitude knowledge is a foundational concept within mathematics, observable early in life through behavioural phenomena and linked with spatial-numerical associations. The internal representation of symbolic number magnitude is thought to be a directional left to right mental number line, acting as a framework to encode conceptual understanding and to support problem solving. Accurate performance on the associated metric, the number line estimation task (NLE), has been interpreted as improved understanding of number magnitude and is reliably related to maths achievement. However, the exact role spatial skills play in the relationship between number magnitude understanding and NLE tasks is still unclear, particularly as these skills are themselves independently related to maths achievement, whilst also being influential in the proportional judgement strategies used to complete the NLE task. To investigate these relationships, 98 primary children were recruited for a RCT training 3D mental rotation skills using a computer-based tool, over ten sessions. Spatial skill and NLE performance strongly correlated with maths achievement, and although spatial training improved spatial ability, this was not significant. Unexpectedly, spatial training did not influence NLE performance. Implications for EPs include effective use of number line tasks to target weak number magnitude understanding, and benefits of providing spatial tasks to support positive maths outcomes.

The first three groups had been admitted to hospital for treatment of protein energy malnutrition between the ages of eight to 15, 16 to 21 and 22 to 27 months, respectively. The comparison group had not been clinically malnourished throughout the whole period up to 27 months of age. All the children came from one tribe and were individually matched for sex, age, education and home environment. It was found that the three malnourished groups fell significantly below the comparison group in anthropometric measurements and in tests of intellectual and motor abilities. No evidence was found for a relationship between the deficit and age at admission. Further analysis among the 60 malnourished children revealed that anthropometry and intellectual and motor abilities are the more affected the greater the degree of ‘chronic undernutrition’ at admission, but no correlation was found with the severity of the ‘acute malnutrition’. The results show a general impairment of intellectual abilities, with reasoning and spatial abilities most affected, memory and rote learning intermediately and language ability least, if at all, affected. These findings are discussed in the context of a comprehensive and critical appraisal of the existing literature. Malnutrition énergétique et protéinique de la première enfance, ses conséquences intellectuelles et sur les aptitudes motrices chez l'enfant plus âgé et l'adolescent Trois groupes d'enfants ougandais—chacun de 20—et un groupe contrôle de 20 enfants ont été examinés entre les âges de 11 et 17 ans. Les trois groupes d'étude avaient été antérieurement admis pour traitement de malnutrition énergétique et protéinique respectivement entre les âges de huit à 15 mois, 16 à 21 mois et 22 à 27 mois. Le groupe contrôle n'avait pas présenté de période de malnutrition cliniquement décelable durant toute la période des 27 premiers mois. Tous les enfants venaient d'une même tribu et étaient individuellement appariés en fonction du sexe, de l'âge, de l'éducation et de l'environnement familial. Les trois groupes malnutris se situaient significativement au‐dessous du groupe contrôle en données anthropométriques, aptitudes intellectuelles et motrices. Il n'a pas été observé de relation entre le déficit et l'âge à l'admission. Une analyse plus poussée parmi les 60 enfants malnutris montre que les données anthropométriques, les aptitudes intellectuelles et motrices sont d'autant plus affectées que le degré de ‘sous‐nutrition chronique’était le plus marquéà l'admission mais aucune corrélation n'a été notée avec la gravité de ‘la malnutrition aigüe’. Les résultats montrent une altération générale des aptitudes intellectuelles, la raisonnement et l'aptitude spatiale étant le plus touché, la mémoire et les apprentissages de routine à un degré moyen, l'aptitude de langage très légèrement ou pas du tout. Ces données sont discutées dans une revue globale et critique de la littérature. Eiweißmangelernährung im frühen Kindesalter mit Auswirkungen auf die intellektuellen und motorischen Fähigkeiten des älteren Kindes und des Heranwachsenden Drei Gruppen ugandischer Kinder (je 20) und eine Kontrollgruppe von 20 Kindern wurden im Alter zwischen 11 und 17 Jahren untersucht. Die drei Untersuchungsgruppen waren zuvor im Alter von 8 bis 15 bzw. 16 bis 21 bzw. 22 bis 27 Monaten stationär wegen einer Eiweißmangelernährung behandelt worden. Die Kontrollgruppe war während der gesamten Periode bis zum Alter von 27 Monaten klinisch nicht unterernährt. Alle Kinder waren von einem Stamm und wurden individuell zusammengestellt im Hinblick auf Geschlecht, Alter, Erziehung und häusliche Verhältnisse. Die drei mangelernährten Gruppen waren in Bezug auf körperliche Entwicklung sowie intellektuelle und motorische Fähigkeiten der Kontrollgruppe signifikant unterlegen. Es fand sich keine Korrelation zwischen dem Defizit und dem Alter bei der Aufnahme. Die weitere Aufschlusselung der 60 mangelernährten Kinder zeigt, daß die körperliche Entwicklung und die intellektuellen und motorischen Fähigkeiten umso mehr beeinträchtigt sind, je größer das Ausmaß der ‘chronischen Unterernährung’ bei der Aufnahme war, jedoch fand sich keine Korrelation zur Schwere einer ‘akuten Mangelernährung’. Die Ergebnisse zeigen eine allgemeine Beeinträchtigung der intellektuellen Fähigkeiten, wobei der Denkprozeß und die Raumerfassung am meisten, Gedächtnis und Lernfähigkeit mittelschwer und Sprachfähigkeit am wenigsten wenn überhaupt betroffen sind. Diese Befunde werden im Zusammenhang mit einer umfassenden und kritischen Beurteilung der dazu existierenden Literatur diskutiert. Malnutrición energética proteica en la infancia precoz como causa de afectación del intelecto y de las habilidades motoras en el niño mayor y en el adolescente Tres grupos de niños de Uganda (20 casos en cada uno) y un grupo comparativo de 20 niños fueron examinados entre las edades de 11 y de 17 años. Los tres grupos de estudio habían sido admitidos previamente para el tratamiento de una malnutrición en proteínas entre las edades de 8 a 15, 16 a 21 y 22 a 27 meses respectivamente. El grupo control no había sufrido malnutrición clínica en todo el periodo hasta los 27 meses de edad. Todo los, niños procedian de una tribu y fueron individualmente emparejados según sexo, edad, educación y ambiente en el hogar. Los tres grupos desnutridos se situaron significativamente por debajo del grupo control en entropometría y actividades motrices e intelectuales. No se halla ninguna evidencia de relatión entre el déficit y la edad de ingreso. Un análisis más amplio entre los 60 niños desnutridos muestra que la antropometría y la habilidad intelectual y motriz están tanto más afectadas cuanto mayor es el grado de ‘desnutrición crónica’ en el ingreso, pero no se halla ninguna correlatión con la gravedad de la ‘denutrición aguda’. Los resultados muestran una alteratión general de las habilidades intelectuales, estando más afectados el razonamiento y las habilidades espaciales; afectados de forma intermedia la memoria y el aprendizaje memorístico, siendo la habilidad para el lenguaje no afectado o la menos afectada. Estos hallazgos son discutidos en el contexto de una revisión extensa y crítica de la literatura existente. Copyright © 1976, Wiley Blackwell.

An increasing body of research has examined patient outcomes beyond discharge from the intensive care unit and hospital. One area of focus is neurobehavioral outcomes including neurocognitive sequelae and neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Cognitive functions are brain-based or mental activities that involve acquiring, storing, retrieving, and using information and include domains such as memory, attention, executive function, mental processing speed, spatial abilities, and general intelligence. It is known from other medical specialties that impaired cognitive function can have a broad, substantial, and long-lasting impact on a patient's life. This paper examines the current evidence for neurocognitive impairments in survivors of critical illness. Recent findings: Recent studies support the hypothesis that critical illness can lead to significant impairments in neurocognitive function. Current work indicates that the neurocognitive impairments can last for months or years after a patient arrives home and may have important consequences for quality of individual and family life and for ability to return to work as well as substantial economic costs. The mechanisms of neurocognitive impairments are not fully understood, but in acute respiratory distress syndrome hypoxemic burden appears important. Summary: Among the potential consequences of critical illness are now included neurocognitive impairments. Future research should include the search for strategies for the early identification of neurocognitive impairments, mechanisms of brain injury, and therapeutic modalities designed to prevent or decrease neurocognitive morbidity. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

American journal of neuroradiology	https://doi.org/10.3174/ajnr.A2114	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Injury of the cerebellar vermis may occur in children with brain malignancies. Because the vermis is involved in motor and cognitive  functioning, the goal of this prospective longitudinal study was to evaluate  treatment-related changes in vermal volumes and neuropsychologic performance in  children receiving brain radiation of the cerebellum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten  patients (mean age, 11.6 years) and 10 healthy children (mean age, 12.1 years) were  examined. Lobar vermal volumes and performance on neuropsychologic tests evaluating  motor, visual, verbal, attention, memory, and executive functions were assessed at  baseline and at 6-month follow-up visits. RESULTS: At baseline, lower mean vermal  volumes and impaired performance on visual-spatial and fine-motor tasks were  detected in patients. At 6-month follow-up, further decrease in vermal volumes was  detected only in patients with medulloblastoma, who received the largest radiation  doses to the entire vermis. The volume decrease was not associated with reduction in  neuropsychologic performance compared with baseline. At 6-month follow-up, data from  all subjects revealed an association between smaller vermal volumes and slower  fine-motor speed and lower visual-spatial skills. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced brain-tissue  volumes following radiation have been reported previously in pediatric patients. In  this study, lower vermal volumes were detected even earlier, before radiation  treatment was initiated or completed. Six months postradiation, vermal volume  decreases detected in patients with medulloblastoma were not accompanied by declines  in already poor neuropsychologic performance. In addition to radiation, the presence  of brain malignancies and preradiation treatment may be important factors affecting  cerebellar vermis tissue.

Specifically, visuo-spatial ability is assessed by analysing subjects' digitised responses to a simple figure copying task using a conventional test environment. The algorithm was trained to distinguish between classes of visuo-spatial ability based on responses to the figure copying test by 7-11 year old children in which visuo-spatial ability is at varying stages of maturity. Results from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are presented for the training and subsequent testing of the algorithm and demonstrate this technique has the potential to form the basis of an objective assessment of visuo-spatial ability. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Journal of Cognition and Development	https://doi.org/10.1080/15248372.2012.760158	Previous studies provided evidence of a relationship between mental rotation (MR) and motor processes in children and adults. However, there is no direct evidence that MR ability is a reliable predictor of success for motor performance. After completion of a MR test, the motor performance of 7- to 8-year-old and 11- to 12-year-old children was measured along a steeple chase and an equivalent straight distance sprint. The chase involved several motor actions requiring, among different competencies, spatial abilities such as performing a forward roll, jumping, crawling, turning, and changing directions. Data revealed that the time taken to complete the chase was influenced by speed and sex, but also by the individual MR ability. Based on these findings, we assume that MR and motor performance may share similar subprocesses. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

More recently, gender differences in MR were also reported in infancy. However, different kinds of paradigms and stimuli were used. The present study investigates whether the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotation Test (VMRT; Vandenberg & Kuse, 1978) as well as another similar 2-dimensional stimuli test may be used with elementary and middle-school children, and whether gender differences are evidenced. Results show that boys outperform girls in the middle-school group only. Elementary school children encountered difficulties solving both the VMRT and 2D MR tests. The data confirmed recent results showing that gender differences in the VMRT performance were found at age 10. We further concluded that the VMRT and 2D MR tests may not be well-designed for elementary-school children. Further investigations should focus on gender differences in MR for children younger than 9 years old as well as on the underlying causes of such difference, using other experimental paradigms.

The underlying biology is however not well known. In the DSM-5, ASD is characterized by difficulties in two domains: Social Interaction and Repetitive and Restricted Behavior, RRB. Insistence of Sameness is part of RRB and has been reported related to executive functions. We aimed to identify differences between ASD and typically developing (TD) adolescents in Event Related Potentials (ERPs) associated with response preparation, conflict monitoring and response inhibition using a cued Go-NoGo paradigm. We also studied the effect of age and emotional content of paradigm related to these ERPs. We investigated 49 individuals with ASD and 49 TD aged 12-21 years, split into two groups below (young) and above (old) 16 years of age. ASD characteristics were quantified by the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and executive functions were assessed with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), both parent-rated. Behavioral performance and ERPs were recorded during a cued visual Go-NoGo task which included neutral pictures (VCPT) and pictures of emotional faces (ECPT). The amplitudes of ERPs associated with response preparation, conflict monitoring, and response inhibition were analyzed. The ASD group showed markedly higher scores than TD in both SCQ and BRIEF. Behavioral data showed no case-control differences in either the VCPT or ECPT in the whole group. While there were no significant case-control differences in ERPs from the combined VCPT and ECPT in the whole sample, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) was significantly enhanced in the old ASD group (p = 0.017). When excluding ASD with comorbid ADHD we found a significantly increased N2 NoGo (p = 0.016) and N2-effect (p = 0.023) for the whole group. We found no case-control differences in the P3-components. Our findings suggest increased response preparation in adolescents with ASD older than 16 years and enhanced conflict monitoring in ASD without comorbid ADHD during a Go-NoGo task. The current findings may be related to Insistence of Sameness in ASD. The pathophysiological underpinnings of executive dysfunction should be further investigated to learn more about how this phenomenon is related to core characteristics of ASD. © 2017 Høyland, Øgrim, Lydersen, Hope, Engstrøm, Torske, Nærland and Andreassen.

Methods: A total of 91 patients were collected in the observation group, 48 of them had basal ganglia hemorrhage, and 43 had basal ganglia infarction. The neuropsychological tests were carried out twice in the post-stroke acute phase (3 weeks after stroke) and convalescent phase (6 to 9 months after stroke) in the observation group; 77 healthy persons in the control group whom also completed the neuropsychological tests. Results: There were significant differences in the score of each cognitive domain in the basal ganglia hemorrhage and basal ganglia infarction groups in acute phase as compared to the control group (P <0.05). In additional to executive function (semantic category fluency), there was significant difference in the neuropsychological test scores in the convalescent phase as compared to the acute phase in the basal ganglia hemorrhage group (P <0.05). There were also significant differences in the scores of the memory, executive function (semantic category fluency), information processing speed (digit-symbol test), vision-spatial ability (block test and clock drawing test) in convalescent phase in the basal ganglia hemorrhage group as compared to those in the control group (P <0.05), while there were no significant differences in the scores of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), attention, executive function (Stroop C) and information processing speed (Stroop A) as compared to those in the healthy control group (P >0.05). In addition to attention (the forward and backward digit span test), memory (recognition) and executive function (the semantic category fluency test), there was significant difference between the convalescent phase and the acute phase in the scores of the neuropsychological test of the basal ganglia infarction group (P <0.05). There were significant differences in the scores of memory, information processing speed (digit-symbol test), visuospatial and visuoconstructive abilities (block test and clock drawing test) in the convalescent phase of the basal ganglia hemorrhage group when compared to those of the healthy control group (P <0.05), while there were no significant differences in the scores of MMSE, executive function (Stroop C) and information processing speed (Stroop A) of the basal ganglia hemorrhage group when compared to those of the healthy control group (P >0.05). Conclusion: There are several cognitive impairments in the acute phase of basal ganglia stroke. Most cognitive domains are improved in the convalescent phase. A part of them may be basically achieved to the healthy control level.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Most previous studies have involved children and arithmetic rather than more advanced forms of mathematics. This study compared the performance of groups of adult mathematics and humanities students. Experiment 1 employed verbal and visuo-spatial working memory span tasks using a novel face-matching processing element. Results showed that mathematics students had greater working memory capacity in the visuo-spatial domain only. Experiment 2 replicated this and demonstrated that neither visuo-spatial short-term memory nor endogenous spatial attention explained the visuo-spatial working memory differences. Experiment 3 used working memory span tasks with more traditional verbal or visuo-spatial processing elements to explore the effect of processing type. In this study mathematics students showed superior visuo-spatial working memory capacity only when the processing involved had a comparatively low level of central executive involvement. Both visuo-spatial working memory capacity and general visuo-spatial skills predicted mathematics achievement. © 2019, PsychOpen. All rights reserved.

Personalized training prescription applying progression rules, is missing. We adapted a theory-based taxonomy for a rehabilitation approach using user-centered exergames. The aims were primarily to investigate the feasibility of this rehabilitation approach, and secondarily to evaluate its performance of personalizing training progression, as well as explore the effects on secondary outcomes. Methods: Chronic stroke patients (≥ 18 years) were included, who were able to walk 10 meters and stand for 3 min. The rehabilitation approach was administered twice per week for 8 weeks. As primary outcome, feasibility was evaluated by comparing achieved rates of inclusion, adherence, compliance, attrition, motivation, and satisfaction to pre-defined thresholds for acceptance. Secondary outcomes were (1) perceived motor and cognitive task difficulty throughout the intervention; (2) measures collected during baseline and post-measurements—a gait analysis, the Timed-up-and-go test (TUG), several cognitive tests assessing attentional, executive, and visuospatial functions. Results: Thirteen patients [median: 68.0 (IQR: 49.5–73.5) years, median: 34.5 (IQR: 12.25–90.75) months post-stroke] were included, of whom ten completed the study. Rates for inclusion (57%), adherence (95%), compliance (99%), motivation (77%), and satisfaction (74%) were acceptable, however, the attrition rate was high (23%). The perceived motor and cognitive task difficulty predominantly moved below the targeted range. We found a significant change in the TUG (p = 0.05, r = 0.46) and medium-to-large effect sizes (p > 0.05) for swing time of the affected leg, the asymmetry index, time needed for the Trail-making test (TMT) A and accuracy for the TMT B and the Mental Rotation Test (MRT; 0.26 ≤ r ≤ 0.46). Discussion: The intervention was feasible with minor modifications necessary, which warrants a larger trial investigating the effects of the rehabilitation approach following the adapted taxonomy on mobility, gait and cognitive functions. Two main limitations of the rehabilitation approach were; (1) the taxonomy decoupled motor and cognitive progression, which may be improper as motor and cognitive learning is coupled; (2) separate subjective ratings were used to guide the progression. Future studies should develop an instrument to objectively assess motor-cognitive task difficulty for monitoring the progression of an exergame-based training.

Human children take an unusually long time to master this task and tend to solve rotational problems through the use of nongeometric features or landmarks as opposed to other kinds of spatial cues. We investigated whether these developmental characteristics are unique to humans by testing rotational displacement skills in a monkey species, the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), using a looking-time method. Monkeys first saw food hidden in two differently colored boxes within an array. The array was then rotated 180° and the boxes reopened to reveal the food in an expected or unexpected location. Our first two experiments explored the developmental time-course of performance on this rotational displacement task. We found that adult macaques looked longer at the unexpected event, but such performance was not mirrored in younger-aged macaques. In a third study, we systematically varied featural information and visible access to the array to investigate which strategies adult macaques used in solving rotational displacements. Our results show that adult macaques need both sets of information to solve the task. Taken together, these results suggest both similarities and differences in mechanisms by which human and nonhuman primates develop this spatial skill. © 2012 American Psychological Association.

The highest level of caffeine exposure decreased total rearing and increased immobility, and increased entries and occupancy of the open arms. Differences between the open and the preferred enclosed arms in frequencies of entries, occupancy, and walking were also greatest for rats exposed to the highest level of caffeine, and adrenal gland weights relative to body weight were highest for males in this group. Although some of the results support earlier reports of long-lasting heightened emotional reactivity following perinatal caffeine exposure, others did not. It was suggested that preexperimental and testing procedures may have provided a situation less aversive than those in which perinatal caffeine effects have been observed previously. Treatment effects on open-arm behavior might have arisen from impaired spatial ability.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Early Child Development and Care	https://doi.org/10.1080/03004430500147540	In 1993, Rauscher et al. reported a temporary increase in spatial-temporal ability after listening to Mozart's music. This led to numerous replication and extension studies with mixed findings in the past decade. This study investigated the 'Mozart effect' in preschool children. Forty-one boys and girls, aged three to five, attempted a series of pencil-and-paper maze tests after each of three listening conditions: Mozart's Piano Concerto in A Major (K488), age-appropriate popular music and silence.

Clinical & experimental optometry	https://doi.org/10.1111/cxo.12404	BACKGROUND: Many studies on vision and driving cessation have relied on measures of sensory function, which are insensitive to the higher-order cognitive aspects of  visual processing. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between  traditional measures of visual sensory function and higher-order visual processing  skills with incident driving cessation in a population-based sample of older  drivers. METHODS: Two thousand licensed drivers aged 70 years or older were enrolled  and followed for three years. Tests for central vision and visual processing were  administered at baseline and included visual acuity, contrast sensitivity,  sensitivity in the driving visual field, visual processing speed (useful field of  view [UFOV] Subtest 2 and Trails B) and spatial ability measured by the Visual  Closure Subtest of the Motor-free Visual Perception Test. Participants self-reported  the month and year of driving cessation and provided a reason for cessation. Cox  proportional hazards models were used to generate crude and adjusted hazard ratios  with 95% confidence intervals between visual functioning characteristics and risk of  driving cessation over a three-year period. RESULTS: During the study period, 164  participants stopped driving, which corresponds to a cumulative incidence of 8.5 per  cent. Impaired contrast sensitivity, visual fields, visual processing speed (UFOV  and Trails B) and spatial ability were significant risk factors for subsequent  driving cessation after adjusting for age, gender, marital status, number of medical  conditions and miles driven. Visual acuity impairment was not associated with  driving cessation. Medical problems (63 per cent), specifically musculoskeletal and  neurological problems, as well as visual problems (17 per cent) were cited most  frequently as the reason for driving cessation. CONCLUSION: Assessment of cognitive  and visual functioning can provide useful information about subsequent risk of  driving cessation among older drivers. In addition, a variety of factors, not just  vision, influenced the decision to stop driving and may be amenable to intervention.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

It is proposed that a cluster of cognitive and linguistic skills may be identified as being advantageous or disadvantageous to an individual in learning a second language.    The causes for variation in the ease with which children learn languages may correlate with individual differences in brain structure. These differences may be caused by anomalies or lags in the development process.    The model for the study draws upon the Geschwind/Galaburda theory of the association between individual differences in cognitive skills and individual variation in neuroanatomical structure. The study expands this model to investigate second language learning ability.    Those with low ability for second language learning may exhibit subtle language deficits in L1, coupled with above average abilities in mathematical reasoning and visuo-spatial construction. Conversely, students with high ability for language learning may exhibit better L1 skills and less ability in visuo-spatial skills than the low ability group.    Thirty third to fifth grade English learners of average intelligence and L1 ability were grouped into Fast and Slow groups based on years required to reach criterion on the school proficiency test. A battery of neuropsychological and linguistic tasks was administered.    Fast English learners were significantly better than the Slow learners only on a verbal analogies test, and had a trend toward higher scores on the Spanish vocabulary test. The results of these tests indicate that Fast English learners have more highly developed first language skills than Slow L2 learners. The Slow learners' lower scores on L1 tasks suggest a language processing system adequate for L1 but overloaded by L2.    A discriminant analysis procedure correctly assigned 90% of Slow L2 learners based upon the subjects' scores on six variables. The results of this study provide a neuropsychological framework for the study of second language learning aptitude, and underline the existence of individual differences in human cognitive skills among average subjects. More specifically for the field of second language learning, this study indicates that differences in ability may be based on factors which have not previously been widely considered.

Spatial Cognition and Computation	https://doi.org/10.1080/13875868.2020.1734601	We examined how 4- to 5-year-old children and adults use perceptual structure (visible midline boundaries) to visually scale distance. Participants completed scaling and no scaling tasks using learning and test mats that were 16 and 64 inches. No boundaries were present in Experiment 1. Children and adults had more difficulty in the scaling than no scaling task when the test mat was 64 inches but not 16 inches. Experiment 2 was identical except visible midline boundaries were present. Again, participants had more difficulty in the scaling than no scaling task when the test mat was 64 inches, suggesting they used the test mat edges (not the midline boundary) as perceptual anchors when scaling from the learning to the test mat. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

In two exploratory  studies this questionnaire was administered to subjects with high estimated levels  of early transpersonal experiences and practising meditators, with respective  undergraduate controls. A cognitive skills/precocity model of early transpersonal  experience was contrasted with a vulnerability of self model by comparisons of these  groups on questionnaire categories, imaginative absorption, neuroticism, and  visual-spatial skills, with some support found for both models depending on  experience type, age of estimated recall, and adult meditative practice.

Prior to testing, half of the Ss in each group had been habituated to the familiar array, whereas the other half had been familiarized but interrupted before habituation could be completed. Results show that habituated Ss in each group preferred to look at and manipulate toys in a novel array. In contrast, interrupted Ss preferred toys in a familiar array, but only if the array was complex relative to age (3 toys for 8-mo-olds and 5 toys for 12-mo-olds) and only with the focused manipulation measure. If the stimulus was simple and/or the response measured was VF, interrupted Ss showed no preference for either array. Findings provide evidence of a progression from familiarity preference to novelty preference that is not tied to a particular age but occurs repeatedly as new stimuli are encountered. Age-related changes are present, however, in the effective complexity of the stimuli, the amount of familiarization, and the form of response necessary to elicit the progression.

The sample consisted of 100 women and their 3 - 5-year-old children (44 boys and 56 girls) recruited from the general community. Forty-three percent of mothers had experienced domestic violence within the last year, defined by at least one physically aggressive act by an intimate partner. Children who had witnessed domestic violence had significantly poorer verbal abilities than nonwitnesses after controlling for SES and child abuse, but there were no group differences on visual - spatial abilities. Domestic violence also indirectly affected both types of intellectual abilities through its impact on maternal depression and the intellectual quality of the home environment. Strengths and limitations of the study are discussed, as well as the implications for interventions for young child witnesses.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Perspective problems are much more difficult and show a different error pattern. Experiment II contrasts standard perspective problems, in which a child must anticipate the appearance of the array to an observer whose position differs from his own, to "perspective-move" problems, in which a child must anticipate the appearance of the array from his own new position; i.e., he himself moves. The latter problems are much easier, and the error pattern is much like that for rotation problems. The mental operations involved in solving these various types of problems are discussed. © 1973.

Current opinion in neurobiology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2016.02.007	Gender stereotypes hold that males outperform females in mathematics and spatial tests, and females outperform males on verbal tests. According to meta-analyses,  however, among both children and adults, females perform equally to males on  mathematics assessments. The gender difference in verbal skills is small and varies  depending on the type of skill assessed (e.g., vocabulary, essay writing). The  gender difference in 3D mental rotation shows a moderate advantage for males, but  this gender difference occurs in the absence of a spatial curriculum in the schools.  Meta-analyses of gender differences across a wide array of psychological qualities  support the Gender Similarities Hypothesis, which states that males and females are  quite similar on most-but not all-psychological variables.

Scientific reports	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37729-7	This study aimed to explore the development of mental rotation ability throughout life by comparing different kinds of stimuli. Thirty-six children (6-9 years-old),  30 young (20-28 years-old) and 30 elderly people (60-82 years-old) performed mental  rotation tasks with abstract (i.e. two-dimensional lines) and concrete stimuli (i.e.  hands, human/animal faces). The results showed that overall young people  outperformed children and elderly people, while children were less accurate than the  elderly. However, the effect of age was shaped by the kinds of stimuli: (a) young  people were more accurate than children and elderly people particularly with  abstract stimuli; (b) elderly people improved their performance with images  depicting faces; (c) children performed better with body-related stimuli than animal  faces. Finally, performance was more difficult when stimuli were rotated by 180°,  especially for younger and older females. We may conclude that the effects of age  are modulated by the characteristics of the stimuli with a specific difficulty for  abstract stimuli and a facilitation for concrete stimuli. As an innovative aspect,  during childhood there appeared a specific facilitation for body-related stimuli,  not just for concrete ones. These findings are interpreted according to embodied  models of cognitive development and the effects of ageing on the brain.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Seminars in perinatology	https://doi.org/10.1053/j.semperi.2013.11.009	As more and more critically ill neonates survive, it becomes important to evaluate long-term morbidity. This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of medical  and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children who as neonates received treatment with  extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Most patients-except those with  congenital diaphragmatic hernia-have normal lung function and normal growth at older  age. Maximal exercise capacity is below normal and seems to deteriorate over time in  the CDH population. Gross motor function problems have been reported until school  age. Although mental development is usually favorable within the first years and  cognition is normal at school age, many children experience problems with working  speed, spatial ability tasks, and memory. In conclusion, children who survived  neonatal treatment with ECMO often encounter neurodevelopmental problems at school  age. Long-term follow-up is needed to recognize problems early and to offer  appropriate intervention.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Seventy-one students from the Falk School in Pittsburgh were pre-tested to determine their level of spatial ability, then randomly divided into two treatment groups in order to study a Web-based instructional unit on flowering plants, organized with either tiled window presentation or single page presentation. A posttest measured participants' acquisition of the instructional content. Posttest and spatial ability test scores were analyzed using multi-variate linear regression for the full sample (n = 71) and three sub-samples: (a) 4th and 5th grade students only, (b) female students only, and (c) 4th and 5th grade female students only. The data from all four sample groups showed a significant relationship between spatial ability and achievement of cognitive knowledge at the 1% level of significance. The interaction between spatial ability and style of window presentation was not significant in the full sample, but was significant in the sub-samples either at the 10% or 5% level. In neither the full sample nor any sub-sample data did window presentation style have an impact on average posttest score. In all analyses, the higher the level of spatial ability, the higher the posttest score. The sub-samples revealed that students with low spatial ability performed better with the tiled windows, while those with high spatial ability did better with the single pages. Neither window presentation style was shown to better foster learning by children of all levels of spatial ability.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Connection-wise statistical analysis, as well as analysis ofregional and global network measures, presented a comprehensivedescription of network characteristics. In all supratentorial regions,males had greater within-hemispheric connectivity, as well as enhanced modularity and transitivity, whereas between-hemisphericconnectivity and cross-module participation predominated in females.However, this effect was reversed in the cerebellar connections.Analysis of these changes developmentally demonstrated differences in trajectory between males and females mainly in adolescence and in adulthood. Overall, the results suggest that male brainsare structured to facilitate connectivity between perception and coordinated action, whereas female brains are designed to facilitatecommunication between analytical and intuitive processing modes.

One hundred ninety-one Japanese children (97 girls, 94 boys; Mage = 100.23 months) were assessed on rapid automatized naming (RAN), vocabulary, morphological awareness, visual-spatial skills, Hiragana reading fluency, and Kanji character recognition at the end of Grade 2 and again at the end of Grade 3. Results of cross-lagged analysis showed that Hiragana reading fluency in Grade 2 predicted RAN and visual-spatial skills in Grade 3, and Kanji character recognition in Grade 2 predicted vocabulary in Grade 3, even when the same skills in Grade 2 were controlled. Taken together, these findings suggest that the nature of the script children learn can influence how developing reading skills affect their cognitive underpinnings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

The aim of this study was to assess sexual dimorphic abilities related to oral language, spatial abilities, and verbal fluency and to determine the existence of learning disabilities in 11 congenital girls with adrenal hyperplasia compared with 11 healthy girls. Both groups underwent a neuropsychological evaluation using the Child Neuropsychological Assessment battery for Spanish-speaking children. Results showed that the congenital adrenal hyperplasia group had a significantly lower performance than the control group in the repetition and expression domains, right-left comprehension task, and verbal semantic fluency task. A higher incidence of learning disabilities (predominantly reading related) in the patient group compared with their controls was also evident. Thus, the presence of weak verbal areas along with a high incidence of learning disabilities related primarily, though not exclusively, to reading was documented in these girls. © 2008 Sage Publications.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) interrupts the communication between brain and body and the effects of this deafferentation on body representation are poorly understood. We investigated whether the relative weight of somatosensory and visual frames of reference for body representation is altered in individuals with incomplete or complete SCI (affecting lower limbs'somatosensation), with respect to controls. To study the influence of afferent somatosensory information on body representation, participants verbally judged the laterality of rotated images of feet, hands, and whole-bodies (mental rotation task) in two different postures (participants'body parts were hidden from view). We found that (i) complete SCI disrupts the influence of postural changes on the representation of the deafferented body parts (feet, but not hands) and (ii) regardless of posture, whole-body representation progressively deteriorates proportionally to SCI completeness. These results demonstrate that the cortical representation of the body is dynamic, responsive, and adaptable to contingent conditions, in that the role of somatosensation is altered and partially compensated with a change in the relative weight of somatosensory versus visual bodily representations.

Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety	https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.3482	PURPOSE: Concerns have been raised that children may be receiving too many immunizations under the recommended schedule in the USA. We used a publicly  available dataset to evaluate the association between antibody-stimulating proteins  and polysaccharides from early childhood vaccines and neuropsychological outcomes at  age 7-10 years. METHODS: Children aged 7-10 years from four managed care  organizations underwent standardized tests for domain-specific neuropsychological  outcomes: general intellectual function, speech and language, verbal memory,  attention and executive function, tics, achievement, visual spatial ability, and  behavior regulation. Vaccination histories up to 24 months of age were obtained from  medical charts, electronic records, and parents' records. Logistic regressions and  structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to determine associations between total  antigens up to 7, 12, and 24 months and domain-specific outcomes. RESULTS: On  average, children (N = 1047) received 7266, 8127, and 10 341 antigens by ages 7, 12,  and 24 months, respectively. For adjusted analyses, increase (per 1000) in the  number of antigens was not associated with any neuropsychological outcomes. Antigen  counts above the 10th percentile, compared with lower counts, were also not  associated with any adverse outcomes. However, children with higher antigen counts  up to 24 months performed better on attention and executive function tests (odds  ratio for lower scores = 0.51, 95% confidence interval = 0.26, 0.99). Similar  results were found with SEM analysis (b = 0.08, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: We did not  find any adverse associations between antigens received through vaccines in the  first two years of life and neuropsychological outcomes in later childhood.  Published 2013.

While its slowly progressive development is a common feature of neurodegenerative processes like Alzheimer's dementia, acute presentations are less frequent and mostly caused by strategic lesions within the cerebral navigation network. Depending on the lesion site, topographical disorientation can originate from deficits in landmark recognition and utilization for route planning (egocentric navigation deficit), or disturbance of an overarching cognitive map of the spatial environment (allocentric navigation deficit). However, objective measurements of spatial navigation performance over time are largely missing in patients with topographical disorientation. Methods: We here report a 55-year-old patient with acute topographical disorientation as the single symptom of right-sided hippocampal hemorrhage and present quantitative gaze-monitoring head camera-based analyses of his path-finding strategy and visual exploration behavior in a real space navigation paradigm. Results: The patient exhibited severe allocentric and also egocentric navigation deficits during the acute phase, shown by higher error rates at finding target items. In addition, he showed a more extensive use of search saccades toward, and fixations on, landmarks that could potentially serve as spatial cues. These deficits had been completely compensated for after four months, when the patient performed unremarkably in the real space navigation task, and used even more strongly allocentric path optimization strategies than age-matched controls. Conclusions: This case report highlights the integral function and right-sided dominance of the hippocampal formation in the cerebral navigation network in humans. It shows that the cognitive map can be restored completely despite a residual hippocampal lesion, which illustrates the enormous plasticity of the cerebral navigation network in humans. © 2018 The Authors.

The identification of separate male and female phenotypes within ASD would help parents, teachers, and clinicians better identify girls who may need ASD-related intervention services, inform the targets and goals of such interventions, and lead to the refinement of diagnostic criteria and instruments designed to diagnose ASD in children.    The current study sought to identify sex-specific cognitive and diagnostic profiles for children with ASD using a sample (N = 253, 213 males, 40 females; Mage = 10 years, Range = 4 - 16) of children from across the United States who are affected and severely affected by ASD (as defined by a complex algorithm developed by the National Database for Autism Research), and who are without intellectual disability or comorbid medical conditions. Well-validated, age-referenced, observational assessments were used to quantify cognitive ability and the clinical features of ASD. The Differential Ability Scales, Second Edition, School Age Battery was used to measure general conceptual ability, verbal ability, nonverbal reasoning ability, and spatial ability, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition was used to measure the clinical features of autism, including restricted or repetitive behaviors and interests, and deficits in reciprocal social interaction and communication. Results suggest that there are significant sex differences within ASD in the domains of nonverbal reasoning ability, spatial ability, the discrepancy between verbal and nonverbal reasoning abilities, and reciprocal social interaction, after controlling for age. Being affected versus severely affected by ASD also contributed to differences between males and females. Implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.

The aim of this randomised prospective study was to evaluate hepatic encephalopathy after mesocaval interposition shunt operation and after repeated endoscopic sclerotherapy. Methods. Forty-five patients with bleeding oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis were randomised to the two treatment groups, 24 to the shunt group and 21 to the sclerotherapy group. The patients were evaluated preoperatively regarding blood tests, hepatic encephalopathy as measured by electroencephalogram with spectral analysis and by a battery of psychometric tests. The direction of portal flow in the shunt group was investigated by shunt phlebography and ultrasonography with Doppler. During follow-up the same investigations were performed twice at median 6.7 and 14.7 months after operation. Results. No statistically significant difference was found during follow-up regarding blood tests and electroencephalography with spectral analysis. Although the preoperative psychometric tests showed that the shunt group performed significantly better than the sclerotherapy group, the first follow-up showed that the shunt group performed statistically worse than the sclerotherapy group in seven of the tests: Synonyms (measuring verbal ability), Block Design Test (measuring visuo-spatial ability), Memory for Design Test, Error Score (measuring memory function), Revised Visual Retention Test, correct answers and the same test error answers (measuring visuo-spatial memory, ability and immediate memory), Digit Symbol Test (measuring perceptual ability) and Trial Making Test B (measuring cognitive motor abilities). Conclusions. Patients treated by mesocaval interposition shunt showed a progressive general reduction in psychometric performance compared with patients treated with repeated sclerotherapy, in whom a general intellectual improvement was observed. This finding corresponds to the reverse direction of the preoperative portal flow to a hepatofugal pattern at first follow-up and at 12 months among two-thirds of the patients. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

(A) Responses on conservation tasks given to Ss of our previous experimental education of number conception were examined for i) consis tency of conservation responses to various sub-items, ii) reliability of conservation responses with a2-week interval.Four out of 8 conservation sub-items given were as follows: After S recognized the equivalence of two collections, E transformed one of them into the prescribed configurations and asked S,“Now, which is more?” Other 4 sub-items concerend the invariance of the quantity of a set beforeand after transformations. The results showed: i) The number of elements in a set or the type of transformations had little effect on the difficulty of items, though the conservation tasks without a standard stimulus (a nontransformed collection) were the more difficult. About 80-85% of 109 5-and 6-year-old childrenmade internally consistent responses, i.e., conservation or nonconservation response to all of the4items. ii) About 70% of 50 children made 4 consistent conservation or non-conservation responses in both of the tests, administered at a two-week interval, and more than 90%, fell in the same category if the distinction was made between 4-conservationrespondents and others. (B) An experiment was carried out to examine the effect of suggestion or counter-suggestion upon responses at conservation tasks.i) Nine 5-yearold children, who had been non-conservers in the ordinary conservation situation, were given suggestions to use numerical rather than perceptual cues. For three of then, the mode of response changed completely and made conservation responses at the test one-week later.Further 2 of them showed a little fluctuation to suggestions but finally settled down at the non-conservation stage.The other 4 children showed no sign of change in the positive direction. ii) On the contrary, [8 5-year-old children, who had always made correct responses at number conservation tasks with a standard stimulus, were given counter-suggestions to emphasize perceptual differences generated by the transformation of one collection. Although one of them regressed to the non-coservation stage, the other 7 did not show any instabilities. (C) The extinction of principle of number conservation was attempted.This experiment, which copied Smedslund's procedure, was to observe children's responses to the tricky situation in which number (quantity of a collection) did not conserve with. spatial transformations.Five out of 9 5-year-old children, who had acquired conservation spontaneously, and 4 out of 7 children who had learned conservation by one of the two training curricula, resisted the attempt at extinction and often interpreted apparent non-conservation as meaning that one element was added or taken away secretly.The remaining. 7 children easily gave up the concept of conservation after 2 or 3 cheating trials and warranted nonconservation by perceptual reasons.It must be noted that 4 non-extinguished children among conservers-by-training were those who had been given the curriculum inducing number conservation by the imagination of inter-number relations, the 3 extin guised were these who had only been given repeat ed confirmation of invariance of a set by counting. Also discussed in detail were the implications of these empirical evidences to process or dynamics. of transition from perceptual-cue-dominance to numerical-inference-cue-dominance as well as appreciated effects of various training procedures. © 1965, The Japanese Association of Educational Psychology.

All the children were tested for hand preference. The children were then pre-tested and post-tested on four tasks that measured various hand skills with their left and right hands. The period of practice between the pre and post-test was four months. Results indicated a percentage gain with practice during development for the left and the right hands of the blind children. The left and right hands of both groups of children did not differ in percentage gain, indicating little or no relationship between hand preference and hand ability. The effects of practice showed gains for the blind children compared to the sighted blindfolded children in the post-test. Results are discussed with a view that use of self- referent cues can improve spatial ability in blind children. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

With this in mind, the Landscape Perception Test (LPT) was designed to isolate the 2-D to 3-D (and vice versa) transformational aspect of spatial cognition. Gender differences were used as an indirect means to examine the contribution of the 2-D to 3-D transformation to spatial performance. Since the LPT was designed by means of an image relevant to geospatial cognition, measures of environmental cognition, as well as experience in various activities, were also examined. One hundred thirty undergraduate students (66 females and 64 males) completed the Childhood Activities Questionnaire, the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Test, the Visualization of Views (VV) Test, the Perspective Taking/Spatial Orientation Test, and the LPT. Results showed higher scores for men than for women on LPT items requiring 2-D to 3-D conversion (LPT23), but not on those requiring the reverse operation. In addition, only the LPT23 produced significant indirect effects of gender on VV Test performance. Performance on the tests was also correlated with environmental cognition and previous experience with spatial activities. The results suggest that dimensional transformation might be a factor significantly contributing to spatial performance. Psychometric aspects of the LPT are also discussed. © 2013 Psychonomic Society, Inc.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Cognitive abilities were assessed as a part of a 6‐year follow‐up laboratory visit. Four subtests were given: reading, numbers, listening, and spatial ability. There were no sinificant differences between boys and girls in cognitive ability scores. Higher levels of perinatal androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) were significantly associated with low age‐6 spatial ability in girls. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant proportion of the variance in cognitive abilities in girls could be accounted for by testosterone and androstenedione. No significant predictions were found for boys. The finding of a stable inverse association between sex and effect of hormones on abilities is discussed. Copyright © 1988 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Legal Asp. e-Soc.	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDS.2010.69	This research examines the relationships between 3 types of Information Technology (IT) use - Internet use, cell phone use and videogame playing, on children's body weight, academic performance, (grades in school and standardized test scores), social selfconcept and self-esteem. Hierarchical regression analyses was used to test 5 hypotheses about relationships between IT use and physical, cognitive, social and psychological outcomes, controlling for age, sex, race and household income. Findings indicated that IT use, including videogame playing was unrelated to body weight when socio-demographic characteristics are controlled. Videogame playing was positively related to visual spatial skills and internet use was positively related to reading skills. Cell phone use was moderately related to social self-competence. Future research should focus on positive outcomes of IT use using crosssectional and longitudinal designs. © 2010 IEEE.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

Onethird were African American and two-thirds were Caucasian American. Results indicated that greater Internet use was associated with better reading skills, but only for children initially low in reading skills. Videogame playing was associated with better visualspatialskills but also with lower GPAs.

Participants were 482 children whose average age was 12 years old. One-third was African American and two-thirds were Caucasian American. Results indicated that IT use did not predict BMI or body weight, contrary to one previous survey and the widespread belief that screen time is responsible for the obesity epidemic among our nation's children. Instead, BMI and body weight were higher for African Americans, older children and children from lower income households. The sole and strong positive predictor of visual-spatial skills was videogame playing, which also predicted lower grade point averages (GPAs). Gender and Internet use predicted standardized test scores in reading skills. Females and children who used the Internet more had better reading skills than did males and children who used the Internet less, respectively. Implications of these findings for future research on the benefits and liabilities of IT use are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A comparison between groups suggested atypical patterns of brain activation for the individuals with Down syndrome. Correlation analyses between an index of visual spatial ability and brain activation depicted a positive relationship between (a) this index and brain activation in regions of the occipital and parietal lobes for the typically developing individuals and (b) the middle and dorsal frontal gyri in the individuals with Down syndrome.

British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1979.tb01705.x	The common claim that Africans exhibit a general weakness in handling spatial relationships is questioned, as is that of a general male superiority. The aim of  the study was to identify some of the specific areas in which ethnic and sex  differences may be located. A sample of 72 Ghanaian children evenly divided  according to sex and early, middle and later stages of primary schooling were  administered a series of tasks adapted from Piaget & Inhelder (1971); the same tasks  were given to an equivalent group of Scottish children. On a block construction task  involving memory the Ghanaians performed at the same level as the Scots when working  from models, but not when the presentation consisted of photographs or line drawings  (P less than 0.001). On two tasks requiring mental rotation of shapes and,  subsequently, the actual assembly of shapes into regular figures, the Ghanaians  again experienced more difficulty (P less than 0.001). Intercorrelation of scores on  the various tasks suggested that the underlying structures of abilities may differ  in Ghana and Scotland. The pattern of sex differences was exactly the same in both  cultures. Girls did less well with the block construction (P less than 0.001), but  there was no significant sex difference on mental rotation or shape assembly.

With regard to the particular task used, namely 3D mental rotation, the same prediction would arise on the basis of Serpell's (1979) ‘specific experience’ hypothesis. Subjects were 40 boys and 40 girls in both Ghana and Scotland, equated for years of education. The results showed a sex difference of the same magnitude in both cultures, thereby throwing doubt on purely environmental interpretations. The findings also clearly argue against a genetic hypothesis put forward by Jensen (1975). 1980 The British Psychological Society	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

An oddity‐choice task was devised consisting of one set of regular and another of irregular figures such that responses could be classified as topological (T), Euclidean (E) or “unrelated” (U), the last indicating failure to categorize figures consistently. A total of 415 children aged 4–12 were tested in Hong Kong, India, Scotland and Zambia. Few significant age trends but highly significant cultural and sub‐cultural differences were found. Contrary to expectation, T responses were roughly constant while the proportion of both E and U responses showed systematic cross‐cultural variations. There was evidence that it is U responses rather than the proportion of E responses which directly reflect spatial ability. The factors producing cultural and sub‐cultural differences are discussed. © 1974 International Union of Psychological Science	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Pediatric blood & cancer	https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.21580	BACKGROUND: Combined cisplatin chemotherapy and cranial irradiation for treatment of medulloblastoma in children can cause significant ototoxicity and impair cognitive  function and quality of life. We have previously demonstrated the conformal  technique of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to reduce ototoxicity,  however, it has been suggested that IMRT may increase risk of cognitive deficits  compared to conventional radiation therapy (CRT). This study compared the impact of  the two treatments on measures of neurocognitive functioning. PROCEDURE: Twenty-five  pediatric patients with medulloblastoma were treated either with CRT or IMRT. In  addition they received neurocognitive assessments to evaluate long-term functional  outcome. Statistical analyses between the two groups were conducted to compare  levels and profiles of performance on tests not confounded with hearing loss.  RESULTS: When compared to CRT, children treated with IMRT did not perform more  poorly on any of the measures. Both groups' mean performance was significantly lower  than published norms on several of the measures employed. CONCLUSION: The benefit of  reduced ototoxicity with IMRT does not appear to be at the cost of a decline in  nonverbal intellectual abilities, visual-spatial skills, processing speed, or fine  motor dexterity when compared to CRT in children with medulloblastoma.

This particular skill, mental rotation, has also been consistently stronger in males than females (Linn & Peterson, 1985). This ability may develop at a very young age and early childhood play experiences may influence mental rotation abilities (Serbin & Connor, 1979; Voyer, Nolan, & Voyer, 2000). Video game playing is becoming increasingly pervasive in young children's lives. While video game playing appears to improve mental rotation skills in adults (Cherney, 2008), there is little information on young children's informal video game playing habits and no information on the relationship between this type of play and mental rotation abilities among kindergarten children. To address this issue, this study evaluated kindergarten children's mental rotation abilities and their video game playing habits. Whether these abilities and habits differed for boys and girls was also explored.    The study used archival data collected as part of an experimental study conducted by Andrews (2009) to examine the development of spatial skills and reasoning in kindergarten students. The participants were 96 kindergarten students (51 girls and 45 boys) randomly selected from two public elementary schools in a large urban school district in southeast Texas.    Parents of the participants completed a questionnaire designed to measure children's home play activities (Andrews, 2009). The questionnaire included items related to their children's home video game playing habits. The participants' mental rotation abilities were measured using the Mental Rotation Task, a developmentally appropriate measure designed by Casey and colleagues (2008).    These two scales, the questionnaire responses and the scores on the Mental Rotation Task, were the measures used as the dependent variables for this study. Chi-square tests for independence, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and univariate analyses were used to analyze within-group and between-group variances on these dependent variables and assess the strength of association between the variables.    The results of the study indicated that boys are significantly more likely than girls to play video games and spend significantly more time doing so. There was no significant effect for gender on the mental rotation task scores. Among kindergarten children, the amount of time spent playing video games per week did not significantly affect mental rotation abilities. The study also provided data on an area not yet explored in early childhood research: the interaction effects of gender, amount of kindergarten children's home video game playing, and its association with mental rotation skills. The result of the analysis indicated that for this age group there was no significant interaction effect for gender and video game playing on mental rotation task performance.    This study provides empirical data and adds to the limited body of information on young children's mental rotation abilities and involvement with video game playing.

Journal of pediatric psychology	https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/26.8.503	OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between neonatal, periventricular brain damage and visuomotor performance in extremely-low-birthweight (ELBW) children of  normal intelligence whose birthweights were appropriate for gestational age (AGA).  METHODS: Seventy-eight ELBW and 23 control children, all six years of age, completed  two "motor-free" tests of visual spatial ability and three tests requiring  visuomotor control. RESULTS: Full-term control children outperformed ELBW children  with periventricular brain damage on all three tests requiring visuomotor guidance.  No group differences were found on two "motor-free" tests of visual spatial ability.  ELBW children without periventricular brain damage performed in a manner  indistinguishable from controls on all tests included in this study.

The neuropsychological evaluation of children tends to focus on language, spatial abilities, executive and motor skills. However, when children are referred for the assessment of possible learning disabilities, it is often necessary to obtain an estimate of memory functions particularly in children with epilepsy. A number of standardized measures are now available for the study of memory efficiency during childhood. Furthermore, recent studies on developmental amnesia evidenced the role of memory process approach and tend to find specific differential memory deficits.

In the same period, children also begin to show a preference for planar views (i.e., views of objects held perpendicular to the line of sight) of objects they manually explore. Are children's emerging view preferences somehow related to contemporary changes in object name vocabulary and object perception? Children aged 18 to 24 months old explored richly detailed toy objects while wearing a head camera that recorded their object views. Both children's vocabulary size and their success in recognizing sparse three-dimensional representations of the geometric shapes of objects were significantly related to their spontaneous choice of planar views of those objects during exploration. The results suggest important interdependencies among developmental changes in perception, action, word learning, and categorization in very young children.

Previous research suggests that toddlers, like adults, show themselves a disproportionate number of planar object views – that is, views in which the objects' axes of elongation are perpendicular or parallel to the line of sight. Here, three experiments address three explanations of this bias: (1) that the locations of interesting features of objects determine how they are held and thus how they are viewed; (2) that ease of holding determines object views; and (3) that there is a visual bias for planar views that exists independently of holding and of interesting surface properties. Children 18 to 24 months of age manually and visually explored novel objects (1) with interesting features centered in planar or ¾ views; (2) positioned inside Plexiglas boxes so that holding biased either planar or non-planar views; and (3) positioned inside Plexiglas spheres, so that no object properties directly influenced holding. Results indicate a visual bias for planar views that is influenced by interesting surface properties and ease of holding, but that continues to exist even when these factors push for alternative views.

Borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) is a clinical entity of polyetiological nature which manifests in heterogeneity of cognitive deficits. The aim of this study was to identify groups of homogenous cognitive profiles within a heterogeneous population of students with BIF. Method. Cognitive profiles of 114 participants with borderline intellectual functioning were assessed based on different patterns of their performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Revised. Results. Through a hierarchical cluster analysis we identified four distinct cognitive profiles: A) children with severe verbal skills deficits and average visual-spatial abilities; b) children with short-term memory and attention deficits; c) children with ACID profile, typical for learning disabilities; d) children with 'flat' cognitive profile where all verbal and performance skills were on borderline IQ level. Conclusions. Identifying strengths and limitations of distinct cognitive profiles among students with borderline intellectual functioning has important implications for further assessment strategies and distinctive approach in designing educational and developmental interventions. © 2021 Polish Psychiatric Association.

Neuroreport	https://doi.org/10.1097/WNR.0b013e328010ff6b	Response times, accuracy and event-related potentials were measured in 24 children (mean age 7.6 years), 24 juveniles (11.4 years) and 24 adults (23.8 years) during a  mental rotation task with letters. Response time and error rates increased with  angular displacements for all age groups. Increasing accuracy with increasing age  suggested that this task was more difficult for younger participants. An  event-related potential amplitude modulation at parietal electrodes as a function of  letter orientation was present for all age groups. The effect was lateralized to the  left for children only, but was bilateral for adults, a finding in line with the  idea of an analytic to holistic processing shift in cognitive development and a  left-hemisphere involvement in analytic, piecemeal mental rotation.

Acta psychologica	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2005.12.006	The experiment validated and extended the finding of Ilan and Miller (1994) [A violation of pure insertion: mental rotation and choice reaction time. Journal of  Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Psychophysics 20, 520-536] that the  mental rotation process is not purely inserted into a mirror-normal discrimination  task. In contrast to their work we used other experimental stimuli (drawings of  animals instead of characters), a different task (same/different comparison) and  investigated this effect under a developmental perspective. Adults and children  between the age of 8 and 10 took significantly longer to respond to upright drawings  of animals in conditions containing rotated stimuli than in conditions containing  only upright stimuli, indicating a violation of pure insertion. In general, we found  evidence that the violation of pure insertion during a mental rotation task itself  can be generalised across stimulus type, task, and subject populations. However, for  children this effect was independent of the format of the stimuli, while for adults  the effect was larger for mirror-imaged than for identical objects. This suggests  that the violation of pure insertion might occur at different processing stages as a  function of age.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Acta psychologica	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2006.11.005	Previous work revealed that mental rotation is not purely inserted into a same-different discrimination task. Instead, response time (RT) is slowed to upright  stimuli in blocks containing rotated stimuli compared to RT to the same upright  stimuli in pure upright blocks. This interference effect is a result of maintaining  readiness for mental rotation. In two experiments we investigated previous evidence  that these costs depend upon distinct sub-processes for children and for adults. In  Experiment 1, the maintaining costs turned out to be independent of the visual  quality of the stimulus for adults but not so for children. Experiment 2 revealed  that the maintaining costs were greatly reduced for adults when they performed  mental rotation as a go-no-go task, but not so for children. Taken together, both  experiments provide evidence that whereas perceptual processes seem to be important  for school-age children to maintain readiness for mental rotation, response  selection is relevant for adults.

Alphanumeric characters, PMA symbols, animal drawings, polygons and 3D cube figures were used with an otherwise completely equivalent experimental design in which age and speed-based IQ were comparable across male and female groups. Small gender-related differences in speed of perceptual comparison were found with the magnitude as well as the direction depending upon the stimulus material. Polygons were the only material that produced substantial and reliable gender differences in mental rotation speed, and additionally revealed gender differences in switching costs. Thus, whereas gender differences in paper–pencil mental rotation tests constitute an empirical reality, the generalization that men outperform women in the speed of mental rotation was not supported in the present experiment.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.106.2.436-446	The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between motor development and spatial cognition. The sample was 20 children with Spina bifida (M age: 11.4 yr., SD  = 1.7) and 20 healthy children as controls (M age: 11.8, SD = 1.8 yr.). An  experimental assessment of motor development in spatial cognition in a simulated  virtual maze by school-age children is lacking. In this study children with Spina  bifida, who were impaired in walking since birth, completed four visuospatial tasks  in a small-scale space (Mental Rotation, Water-Level Task, Embedded Figures Test,  Visual Short-term Memory Test), and a spatial behaviour and knowledge task in a  virtual maze. These children showed poorer performance than children in the control  group on most measures. The results are discussed with respect to theoretical  implications and further research.

Of course, there is a positive effect of movement on health, but can we get smarter through physical activity? This article gives an actual review of scientific studies concerning the relationship between movement and cognitive abilities. It focuses on studies with children and adolescents. Generally it is proven, that there is a positive effect of movement or physical activity on executive functions as well as on visuo-spatial abilities. Since science is still at the beginning of understanding the underlying processes of this complex field of research, a lot of questions need to be answered. Therefore, future research needs to investigate in more detail issues regarding the influence of specific motor abilities on specific cognitive abilities in childhood and adolescents. © 2014.

Twenty five girls and 25 boys of fourth grade solved a chronometric mental-rotation test with action-based gender stereotyped items. Furthermore, manual dexterity was measured. Results showed that instead of gender, manual dexterity and the stereotyped nature of the action-based items influenced mental-rotation performance. A correlation analysis suggests that this result holds true for boys but not for girls. Overall, findings confirm the relation between perception and action, which both develop early in life.

Cognitive Development	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2012.08.005	In contrast to the well documented male advantage in psychometric mental rotation tests, gender differences in chronometric experimental designs are still under dispute. Therefore, a systematic investigation of gender differences in mental rotation performance in primary-school children is presented in this paper. A chronometric mental rotation task was used to test 449 second and fourth graders. The children were tested in three separate groups each with different stimulus material (animal drawings, letters, or cube figures). The results show that chronometric mental rotation tasks with cube figures - even rotated in picture plane only - were too difficult for children in both age groups. Further analyses with animal drawings and letters as stimuli revealed an overall gender difference in response time (RT) favoring males, an increasing RT with increasing angular disparity for all children, and faster RTs for fourth graders compared to second graders. This is the first study which has shown consistent gender differences in chronometric mental rotation with primary school aged children regarding reaction time and accuracy while considering appropriate stimuli. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

After this, participants of the training group learned to juggle over a period of three months, whereas participants of the non-training group did not. At the end of the three-month period all participants solved the mental rotation task again. The difference between the reaction time (RT) in the first and second mental rotation test was measured. Results showed that the RT gain was higher for the participants of the training group compared to the non-training group when mental rotation had to be performed (i.e., when angular disparity was non-zero).

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00984	Mental rotation of visual images of body parts and abstract shapes can be influenced by simultaneous motor activity. Children in particular have a strong coupling  between motor and cognitive processes. We investigated the influence of a rotational  hand movement performed by rotating a knob on mental rotation performance in primary  school-age children (N = 83; age range: 7.0-8.3 and 9.0-10.11 years). In addition,  we assessed the role of motor ability in this relationship. Boys in the 7- to  8-year-old group were faster when mentally and manually rotating in the same  direction than in the opposite direction. For girls and older children this effect  was not found. A positive relationship was found between motor ability and accuracy  on the mental rotation task: stronger motor ability related to improved mental  rotation performance. In both age groups, children with more advanced motor  abilities were more likely to adopt motor processes to solve mental rotation tasks  if the mental rotation task was primed by a motor task. Our evidence supports the  idea that an overlap between motor and visual cognitive processes in children is  influenced by motor ability.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Thirty-four  children from each country completed a motor test and a mental rotation test. It was  found that children in Cameroon showed a better motor ability (better overall gross  motor score and also on most single items) than children in Germany did. This can be  explained by the early motor stimulation in infancy in Cameroon. Concerning mental  rotation performance, Cameroonian children perform below chance level. A positive  correlation between the overall motor ability and mental rotation performance could  only be analyzed and conducted in the German sample. Therefore, this study  emphasizes the need for the development of culture-fair cognitive tests.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Since there is a relationship between motor and visual-spatial ability and because of the reduced motor abilities  of overweight children we assumed that these children might show an impaired mental  rotation performance. Sixteen overweight children (10 years of age) and 16 control  children (10 years of age) were matched by age, gender, and socio-economic status.  Each participant completed a general intelligence test, a motor test, and a  chronometric mental rotation test. The results show differences in both motor  ability and mental rotation accuracy. Overweight children made more errors when the  rotation task was difficult compared to normal weight children. This study gives a  clue to overweight children's problems in spatial cognitive tasks.

Methods: Twenty-seven patients with Alzheimer’s disease in the very early stage (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] >26/30) were divided into three groups: seven patients received LSS-tele treatment, ten received standard LSS-direct intervention, and ten participants underwent UCS as control condition. Intervention treatments consisted of two weekly sessions of LSS (through teleconference or face to face depending on group assignment) or UCS exercises administered to small groups throughout a 3-month period. The main outcome measures were changes of global cognitive performance, language abilities, and memory function. Secondary outcome measures were changes in attention, working memory, executive functions, and visual-spatial abilities tests. Results: The mean MMSE score improved significantly in LSS-tele and LSS-direct treatments; LSS-tele improved language abilities, both phonemic and semantic, and stabilized delayed verbal episodic memory with respect to an improved performance after the LSS-direct intervention and to a memory decline observed in the control group. Improvement was not achieved in any neuropsychological test score after UCS. Conclusion: Clinical application of telecommunication technology to cognitive rehabilitation of elderly patients with neurodegenerative cognitive impairment is feasible and may improve global cognitive performance. Technical aspects to ameliorate efficacy of delivery may further improve its impact on domain-specific cognitive abilities. © 2014 Jelcic et al.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Episodic memory and semantic abilities deteriorate early in Alzheimer disease (AD). Since the cognitive system includes interconnected and reciprocally influenced neuronal networks, the authors hypothesized that stimulation of lexical-semantic abilities may benefit semantically structured episodic memory. Objective. To investigate the effects of lexical-semantic stimulation (LSS) on verbal communication and episodic memory in early AD. Methods. Forty AD participants were randomized to LSS or unstructured cognitive stimulation (UCS) as control condition. Treatments lasted 3 months, 2 sections a week. The primary outcome measures were the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Verbal Naming Test (VNT), Phonemic and Semantic Fluency, Story Recall, and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (RAVL). Secondary outcome measures were neuropsychological tests assessing cognitive functions not stimulated by the intervention, such as attention, executive functions, and visual-spatial abilities, and the instrumental activities of daily living scale. A 6-month follow-up assessment was administered to the LSS group. Results. LSS treatment yielded significant improvements of the MMSE, BNT, VNT, Brief Story Recall, and RAVL delayed recall mean scores. Among secondary outcome measures, only working memory and the speed of a task assessing executive functions (Stroop test) improved after LSS. Unstructured cognitive stimulation intervention did not improve any cognitive domain. Six months after LSS discontinuation, the MMSE mean score remains significantly higher than the baseline value. Conclusion. LSS treatment may improve episodic memory in AD patients and may be regarded as a clinical option to counteract the cognitive decline typical of the disease. © 2012 The Author(s).

Item type, angular disparity, and rotation/flipping were systematically balanced into the items of the redrawn Pentomino-MRT, and two time-constraint conditions were randomly assigned to 813 Grade 4 to 6 primary students when administering the test. Children of these ages are of investigative interest because they are at crucial stages of spatial ability development and are at an age where associated gender differences emerge. The study demonstrates that spatial gender differences can be detected in Grade 4, are more marked in Grade 5, and become stable in Grade 6. The importance of time constraint is acknowledged in how and at what grade gender differences emerge under the conditions of the performance factors investigated. In particular, the performance of girls reminds us to focus on their spatial ability development if later STEM-related field participation is of concern. © Copyright © 2021 Jeng and Lin.

Among the spatial factors underlining the spatial ability, mental rotation was the one in which large gender difference was constantly observed. As a measure of intermediate-scale spatial ability, the present study tested the effectiveness of an interactive test in reducing the gender difference in mental rotation with 442 primary school children of Grades 4 to 6. The results showed that the girls did perform closer to the boys using the interactive items as compared to the static items although overall the boys still outperformed the girls, the gender effect was increasing by age and grade making the largest gender difference occurred in Grade 6. By attending to the gender difference earlier and implementing interactive spatial tests and training, it can be expected to project smaller gender difference and more female participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) later in life span. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A general factor, or psychometric g, was extracted from the tests, and g factor scores were found to be correlated with head size variables not only within individuals, but within twin pairs and between twin pairs. The size of the various tests' g loadings predicts the degree to which the tests are correlated with head size. This finding adds one more biological variable-head size and, by inference, brain size-to the list of other biological variables reported in the literature as showing a significant relation to psychometric g, the general factor common to all cognitive tests. Also, the varying magnitude of the mean difference between groups of white and black children on the 17 tests is related to the tests' loadings on g, on spatial ability, and the tests' correlations with head size. © 1994.

In the present study, we examined parents’ scaffolding behaviors during a dyadic spatial activity, and explored whether these behaviors related to child age and their spatial ability. Forty-five parents and their 4- and 5-year-old child (M= 4.82y, SD = 0.42y, n = 25 females) participated. Children's general and spatial vocabulary, as well as their mental rotation, and performance on two jigsaw puzzle tasks were assessed. Parent-child dyads then used a magnet board to create an elephant from a laminated card. Parent scaffolding, such as their use of gestures, labels and assistance with the activity, was coded. Parents tended to provide more scaffolding for younger children. Controlling for child age, parents provided more scaffolding for children who scored lower on the spatial and puzzle tasks. These results suggest that parents provided greater guidance to children with lower spatial ability.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	mean age 4.82 y old	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The aim of this study was to determine the utility of pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (pVEP) in the diagnosis of dyslexia. Methods: A comparative study was performed in 16. dyslexic children in the National Rehabilitation Institute in Mexico City. The diagnosis of dyslexia was performed with the child neuropsychological assessment battery. Tests of visual acuity and the WISC-R and pVEP tests were also performed. Dyslexics entered a learning therapy program for 6. months. Neuropsychological and neurophysiological measurements were conducted at the beginning and end of the therapeutic program. Results: The neuropsychological battery scores were above 75% in the areas of reading, writing and spatial skills. Student's t-test showed significant differences in mono and binocular pVEP N2 amplitudes ( P<. .05). No significant differences were found in N1, N2 and P100 latencies. Conclusions: pVEP amplitudes should be taken into account to understand the mechanisms of visual processing and stroke clearing in patients with dyslexia. Specific therapy is recommended for reading and writing problems in individual dyslexic persons. © 2012 AELFA.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	dyslexia must be older children	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

One important spatial skill is spatial scaling. We evaluated whether (1) a playful scaling game might promote learning by providing feedback during play, and (2) spatial scaling is related to number-line estimation (NLE) based on the mutual reliance on relative magnitude reasoning. Forty-eight children, ages 5.5–8.3, completed a playful scaling game and a NLE task. Results show that children improve from the first to second half of the task, especially for more difficult trials and for the lowest performing children. In addition, scaling and NLE relate when controlling for age and vocabulary. Similar improvement on the task and relations to NLE were observed in a conceptual replication (N = 52). These results provide support for further study of improving spatial scaling in children, with the possibility to test whether scaling could support related mathematical skills as well. © 2018 International Mind, Brain, and Education Society and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mind, Brain, and Education	https://doi.org/10.1111/mbe.12048	Games provide important informal learning activities for young children, and spatial game play (e.g., puzzles and blocks) has been found to relate to the development of spatial skills. This study investigates 4- and 5-year-old children's use of scaled and unscaled maps when solving mazes, asking whether an important aspect of spatial learning-the ability to use scaled representations-is related to children's play with scaled maps. Results show that almost all children used the maps to solve the mazes at least occasionally, and use them consistently across maze difficulty and different types of maps. Map use and more accurate spatial scaling were associated with better maze performance. We suggest that maze activities including scaled maps might provide an opportunity for developing children's spatial scaling through play, and discuss future research directions. © 2014 International Mind, Brain, and Education Society and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Psychological science	https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797614563338	There is evidence suggesting that children's play with spatial toys (e.g., puzzles and blocks) correlates with spatial development. Females play less with spatial toys  than do males, which arguably accounts for males' spatial advantages; children with  high socioeconomic status (SES) also show an advantage, though SES-related  differences in spatial play have been less studied than gender-related differences.  Using a large, nationally representative sample from the standardization study of  the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition, and  controlling for other cognitive abilities, we observed a specific relation between  parent-reported frequency of spatial play and Block Design scores that was invariant  across gender and SES. Reported spatial play was higher for boys than for girls, but  controlling for spatial play did not eliminate boys' relative advantage on this  subtest. SES groups did not differ in reported frequency of spatial play. Future  research should consider quality as well as quantity of play, and should explore  underlying mechanisms to evaluate causality.

This sketch introduces a study aimed at investigating whether this type of data can be more easily learned by presenting it within a Virtual Environment, where the relationships between data points is represented by equivalent spatial relationships. By converting data relationships to spatial relationships, we are able to use our innate spatial abilities to understand and remember the data. The data is thus converted from an external form, to an internal representation that is always to hand and which is mentally easy to deal with.

Comparisons of Gates-McGinitie reading test scores of an experimental group drilled on map-graph interpretation tasks, in addition to reading, and control group receiving only reading instruction significantly favored the experimental group. The results thus suggested that spatial skills operate causally on subsequent verbal acquisitions, and may be central to the amelioration of reading deficits among low-SES children. © 1978 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1987.tb01413.x	Over 1,800 public school students (grades K-12, ages 6-18) took a battery of 7 spatial tests tailored to their respective developmental levels. Analyses of  resulting data indicate that it is feasible to measure spatial ability throughout  this developmental range with modified versions of adult paper-and-pencil tests,  that a male advantage in spatial performance appears reliably by age 10, and that  the magnitude of the advantage remains constant through age 18. Analysis of  covariance suggests that an early female precocity in language skills may mask a  male advantage in spatial ability during the primary school years. There is no  indication of a sex difference in kindergarten children.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD	https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-150743	BACKGROUND: Late life depression is a prodromal feature and a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We identified five  items in the Geriatric Depression scale (DepE) that are important as a risk for MCI  and AD: memory problems, feeling blue, crying, feeling worthless, and trouble  concentrating. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine the relationship between DepE and  cognition in a cohort of Mexican Americans. METHODS: Data from 317 Mexican Americans  from the HABLE study were analyzed. DepE scores were dichotomized into two groups:  endorsement of 1 item or less, and endorsement of 2 or more items. Cognition was  assessed via neuropsychological tests, and diagnosis was based on consensus review.  We utilized linear regression to examine the association between DepE and cognitive  performance, and logistic regression to examine the utility of DepE in predicting  MCI. To examine the impact of DepE on memory over 12 months, we performed ANOVA  analysis. RESULTS: Elevated DepE scores were associated with poorer performance on  various measures of memory and cognition, but not executive or visual spatial  skills. Over 12 months, we found a decline in immediate memory among women but not  men. Those with high scores were 4 times more likely to have MCI. ANOVA of total  scores revealed differences between groups on immediate memory (p < 0.05) in women,  with no significant differences on delay recall in either gender. CONCLUSION: DepE  can be utilized in Mexican Americans to identify those at risk of memory related  cognitive decline.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The intention of the study was to examine the influence of early physical training on spatial visualization and mathematic skills, to determine whether intensive training in spatial relations would have a differential impact on male/female spatial performance and to gather information concerning the relationship between spatial visualization and mathematic performance.    The investigation was divided into three studies and used 166 college students as subjects. Study one examined the impact of long term physical training, gymnastics, on spatial visualization and mathematic scores of two matched-groups selected from 99 subjects. The two groups, gymnast and control, each consisted of 28 subjects (14 males and 14 females) and were matched on IQ score, age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, parental and sex-role identification, achievement motivation and years of training in other sports. Gymnasts averaged 5.5 years of gymnastic training: the control group had none. Study two examined spatial visualization scores obtained by 67 architectural students (49 males and 18 females) before and after a semester's training in spatial relations. Study three compared scores obtained by all 166 subjects on the Shepard Metzler Mental Rotation Test and a mathematic test derived from the Otis Test of Mental Abilities.    The test of the hypothesis relating to the influence of early physical training on spatial and mathematic performance was not successful as the training of the gymnasts did not extend to early childhood. While significant sex-related differences favoring males were found in spatial performance, the amount of variance in spatial scores accounted for by sex was small, only 8%. No significant sex-related differences in mathematic performance were found. In study two, both males and females significantly improved spatial performance following training, but females did not demonstrate a significantly greater rate of improvement as predicted. The results of the third study indicated a moderate positive relationship between spatial and mathematic performance, however, no evidence was found to support a direct causal relationship between spatial skill and mathematic performance.

Little is known, however, about how infants' motion processing skills are used in such tasks. One important kinetic cue for object shape is structure from motion, but its role in unity perception remains unknown. To address this issue, we presented 2- and 4-month-old infants with displays in which object unity was specified by vertical rotation. After habituation to this display, infants viewed broken and complete versions of the object to test their preference for the broken object, an indication of perception of unity in the occlusion display. Positive evidence for the perception of unity was provided by both age groups. Concomitant edge translation available in 1 condition did not appear to contribute above and beyond simple rotation. These results suggest that structure from motion, and perhaps contour deformation and shading cues, can contribute important information for veridical object percepts in very young infants.

Cognitive research: principles and implications	https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-020-00212-x	Mental rotation (MR) is the ability to transform a mental representation of an object so as to accurately predict how the object would look from a different angle  (Sci 171:701-703, 1971), and it is involved in a number of important cognitive and  behavioral activities. In this review we discuss recent studies that have examined  MR in infants and the development of MR across the first year after birth. These  studies have produced many conflicting results, yet several tentative conclusions  can be reached. First, MR may be operational in infants as young as 3 months of age.  Second, there may be sex differences in MR performance in infancy, in general  favoring males, as there are in children and in adults. Third, there appear to be  multiple influences on infants' MR performance, including infants' motor activity,  stimulus or task complexity, hormones, and parental attitudes. We conclude by  calling for additional research to examine more carefully the causes and  consequences of MR abilities early in life.

In a previously published analysis of these data, performance was analyzed by grade only. In the present analyses, we examined whether the relations between spatial skill and mathematics skill differed across socio-economic levels, for boys versus girls, or both. Our first aim was to test for group differences in spatial skill and mathematics skill. We found that children from higher income families showed significantly better performance on both spatial and mathematics measures, and boys outperformed girls on spatial measures in all three grades, but only outperformed girls on mathematics measures in kindergarten. Further, comparisons using factor analysis indicated that the income-related gap in mathematics performance increased across the grade levels, while the income-related gap in spatial performance remained constant. Our second aim was to test whether spatial skill mediated any of these effects, and we found that it did, either partially or fully, in all four cases. Our third aim was to test whether the “separate but correlated” two-factor latent structure previously reported for spatial skill and mathematics skill was (Mix et al., 2016; Mix et al., 2017) replicated across grade, SES, and sex. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses conducted for each of these subgroups indicated that the same latent structure was present, despite differences in overall performance. These findings replicate and extend prior work on SES and sex differences related to spatial and mathematics skill, but provide evidence that the relations between the domains are stable and consistent across subgroups. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Journal of speech and hearing research	https://doi.org/10.1044/jshr.2603.397	This study investigated the possibility that language-disordered children suffer a pervasive representational deficit. A mental rotation task was used to measure  proficiency in visual imagery, one of the major nonlinguistic symbolic modes. Normal  and language-disordered first and third graders (matched for sex and cognitive  level) were asked to decide whether two geometric arrays were similarly ordered.  Arrays were presented parallel or with the right hand array rotated about its center  either 45 degrees, 90 degrees, or 135 degrees in the picture plane. A significant (p  less than .001) linear relationship between degree of rotation and reaction time  indicated that children in all groups were using imagistic processes.  Language-disordered children did not differ from normal children in accuracy of  judgment or require more training trials, but they did respond more slowly (p less  than .02). These findings suggest an impairment of visual imagery and hence  representational deficits which extend beyond language. Current evidence does not,  however, indicate whether difficulties with nonverbal and verbal symbolic modes stem  from a single source.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, well controlled studies of blind persons with adequate experience show that they can function usefully in space. In other words, vision is not a necessary condition for spatial awareness. On the other hand, though the blind may be equal or even superior to the sighted when performing spatial tasks within the body space, they may be deficient, either developmentally or absolutely, in tasks which involve events at a distance from the body, principally in auditory localization. One possible explanation of the differences between blind and sighted (McKinney, 1964; Attneave & Benson, 1969; Warren, 1970) is that vision is the primary spatial reference, and inputs from other modalities are fitted to a visual map. Several criticisms of this theory are adduced and an alternative theory derived from Sherrington (1947), in which all sensory inputs map on to efferent patterns, is sketched. 1975 The British Psychological Society	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

WIT Trans. Inf. Commun. Tecnol.	https://doi.org/10.2495/IS060111	Recently, tests for spatial reasoning skills were introduced in the UK for young children. However, effort is still directed at improving reading and mathematics, with no defined inclusion of spatial skills training in the curriculum. This is a cause for concern given that spatial skills are important for a range of ICT-related activities - for example, navigating Web sites. Furthermore, such abilities have implications for future subject and career choices. There are well-documented individual differences in spatial skills, with gender being one of the most studied. The current study aimed to determine if short-term training with online 2-D or 3-D spatial puzzles resulted in a greater increase in spatial skills compared to a control group trained with word puzzles. The study, involving 168 children between the ages of 6 and 11 years, investigated the impact of the dimensionality of puzzles, as well as gender, age and starting spatial score. Additionally, the children were questioned on the length of time they spent on computers, and their preferred computer-related pastimes. The results showed a trend for higher spatial scores after training with spatial puzzles compared to the control group, although these results did not reach statistical significance. Younger children demonstrated a greater increase than older children, this age trend being greater amongst the females. Those with lower starting spatial scores showed a significantly greater increase in spatial scores after training. As expected, males reported playing computer games more frequently than females. Furthermore, there was evidence that children with higher spatial scores were actively choosing to play computer games more than other ICT pastimes such as emailing. Based on these findings, a provisional recommendation is made that spatial skills training should be incorporated into the curriculum.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, the required decision-making process places extra cognitive demands on the user, and this may result in disorientation and the phenomenon known as "lost in hyperspace". Individuals with high spatial ability appear to demonstrate superior navigational skills within hypertext, completing tasks more quickly and with fewer errors then those with low spatial ability. They tend to form more accurate internal representations, or cognitive maps, of hypertext systems that correspond better to the underlying physical structure. Little research has been carried out with children to assess their formation of cognitive maps of hyperspace. In this study, 32 children aged 10-11 years from a primary school in the UK were given search tasks to complete on an environmental Web site. Various measures were made of their navigational efficiency, their degree of lostness, and their ability to complete a map of the routes they had traversed. Those with high spatial ability completed the tasks in shorter time, became lost less frequently, and completed the maps more accurately. This paper discusses the implications of these results to the success of hypertext learning environments for learners with low spatial ability.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	3	3	0	0	1

To ensure that all users have equal opportunity for success in the use of these information environments, it is important to understand how lessons learnt from studying spatial ability and other interacting individual differences in real world environments can be translated to abstract information spaces.Â  Little work has been carried out on the navigation of hypertext (specifically with children), or on the impact of spatial ability on navigation of program source code, and these are the two information spaces considered in this thesis.    Six studies are described, each exploring different elements of the importance of spatial ability: its relation to navigational/search strategies and spatial knowledge acquisition; interaction with other individual differences involved in navigational success; and how any disadvantages of low spatial ability can be compensated for through alternative support methods.Â  A consistent finding is that spatial ability has a significant impact on various measures of navigational success in information spaces.Â  Those with low spatial ability performed less efficiently than those with high ability, becoming lost more often, taking longer to complete tasks, making more errors, and finding it harder to produce representations of cognitive maps of the environments.Â  There were interactions with other individual differences, such as gender, age, self efficacy and experience, and a possible relation to the design of the information space.Â  A final important finding was that spatial training had a beneficial effect in children, especially younger girls, and the recommendation was made that formal spatial training should be incorporated into the school curriculum.Â  The results will have implications for all users of hypertext systems and computer programmers, and relevance to curriculum design for young children.    The thesis has made various contributions towards the methodology employed in navigational studies, including the production of a novel map-drawing technique that allows quantification of mental models of a Web site, the application of a lostness metric previously only employed in adult studies, and the development of a heuristic for measuring elements of source code navigation.

In addition, sex differences have been consistently documented showing boys score higher than girls in assessments of spatial ability, particularly mental rotation (Linn & Peterson, 1985; Masters & Sanders, 1993). While sex differences are well established, few studies have focused on kindergarten students' spatial ability and sex differences. Those studies that do exist were conducted 10-to-20 years ago, and may no longer be relevant in light of children's changing play experiences.    This study examined the relationships between gender, kindergarten students' home block play behavior and their test total scores on a Block Design test and Mental Rotation Task. The goal of the study was to develop a deeper understanding of the play experiences or activities that may help to improve young children's spatial abilities and mathematics experiences. While block play has been found to contribute to the development of spatial ability skills in young children (Shore, 1977; Hirsch, 1984), no studies have directly addressed the relationship between kindergarten students' spatial abilities and their home block play.    The study examined the block play experience and spatial ability tests of 96 kindergarten students. Archival data from two spatial ability tests, as well as data collected from a parent questionnaire regarding home block play experiences were utilized for the purpose of this study.    Utilizing chi-square and t-tests, the relationships between the block play experience variables were investigated and indicated significant differences exist in the block play experiences of kindergarten boys and girls.    Next, an investigation using Spearman's correlation was conducted to investigate relationships among predictor variables and spatial ability test scores. Results indicated block and LEGO play were correlated with the Mental Rotation Task. Regression analysis was additionally performed and results suggested minimal impact on Mental Rotation Task and Block Design test scores.    Finally, the relationships among home block play experience variables, gender and spatial ability test scores were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression.

Study I investigated whether mood influences the confidence people have in their event memory. However, there were no significant differences in the realism of the participants' confidence judgments between conditions (elated and neutral). This study concluded that moderate levels of elation might not influence the realism in confidence judgments. In Study II the stability and variability in the realism of confidence judgments over time, content domain and gender were investigated. Two tests, WORD (word knowledge) and DTK (logical/spatial ability), from the Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test were administered on three occasions. The results showed that there were stable individual differences over time and domain in the participants' confidence judgments. No gender differences were found and no effect was found of the cognitive style Need-for-Cognition, NfC. Study III investigated children's (11–12 year old) confidence judgments of answers to questions on their episodic memories. Four different confidence scales were tested; the numeric scale, the picture scale, the line scale and the written scale. The four scales showed no difference for the children's confidence judgments. Further, the children were more overconfident than adults who had used the same material in recent studies. Also, the children's frequency judgments showed overestimation. Finally, Study IV investigated how social feedback influence children's (12 year old) confidence judgments (the same material as in Study III was used). The between-subject factor related to whether the feedback was given by a teacher or a classmate and the within-subject factor concerned type of feedback; confirmatory or disconfirmatory feedback on both correct and incorrect answers. The results showed that the children were overconfident independent of what kind of feedback they received and no effect of the source of the feedback was found. However, confirmatory feedback resulted in worse realism in the children's confidence judgments than disconfirmatory feedback. The children's frequency judgments again showed overestimation. In summary, the results in this thesis show that individual differences and developmental aspects should be added to the five factors that were argued by Allwood and Granhag (1999) to influence confidence judgments; time, feedback, contextual, motivational and experience within the domain.

Brain imaging and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-016-9669-4	Neurofunctional correlates of sexual arousal are of interest in basic research as well as in clinical science. In forensic psychiatry, it is important to use designs  which are potentially robust against susceptibility to manipulation or deception. We  tested a new design to measure neurofunctional correlates of sexual preference.  Twenty-two healthy heterosexual men had to solve a mental rotation task while  sexually preferred or non-preferred distractors were presented simultaneously. With  this challenging active task, subjects' possibility to manipulate their response to  the sexual stimuli should be lower than in easier tasks and in passive designs.  Participants needed more time to solve the mental rotation task when distractors of  women and girls were presented compared to distractors of men and boys. FMRI-results  showed a network of three brain regions which specifically responded to sexually  preferred distractors. Female and adult distractors evoked stronger responses than  male and child distractors in regions comprising parahippocampal/fusiform gyrus and  amygdala/basal ganglia/thalamus, respectively. Women distractors elicited stronger  responses in the inferior parietal lobe compared to all other distractors.  Specifically, sexually preferred distractors elicited a weaker downregulation than  other distractors. We suppose a different emotion regulation with respect to the  sexual relevance of the distractors. To our knowledge, this study is the first to  show neurofunctional correlates of sexual preference under cognitive demand. Further  studies should examine whether this design is more robust against susceptibility to  manipulation than others, in order to be applied as a measurement of sexual  preference in forensic patients.

Journal of learning disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1177/002221949502800109	This study examined the arithmetic calculation abilities of kindergarten and first-grade children with different patterns of cognitive functioning: children with low language but adequate spatial abilities (Low Language; n = 33, male = 42%); children with low spatial but adequate language abilities (Low Spatial; n = 21, male = 42%); children with general delays (Delayed; n = 21, male = 48%); and children with no language or spatial impairments (Nonimpaired; n = 33, male = 48%). Each child was given a series of addition and subtraction calculations presented as nonverbal problems, story problems, and number-fact problems. Story problems and number-fact problems require mastery of conventional verbal symbols, whereas nonverbal problems do not. The findings show that nonverbal, story, and number-fact problem formats are differentially sensitive to variation in cognitive ability. The Low Language group performed significantly worse than the Nonimpaired group on story problems but not on nonverbal problems or number-fact problems. The Delayed group performed significantly worse than the Nonimpaired group on nonverbal problems as well as on story problems but not on number-fact problems. The Low Spatial group did not differ significantly from the Nonimpaired group on any of the three problem types, although the overall performance of these children was weaker. When we adjusted for finger use on number-fact problems, the Nonimpaired group outperformed both the Low Language and the Delayed groups but not the Low Spatial group. Thus, the finding that the Low Language and Delayed groups perform as well as the Nonimpaired group on number-fact problems is attributable to their greater finger use.

Archives of sexual behavior	https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1001834404611	The evolutionary neurological and physical foundations for human sex differences in language, sexuality, and visual spatial skills are detailed and primate and human  studies are reviewed. Trends in the division of labor were established early in  evolution and became amplified with the emergence of the "big brained" Homo erectus.  A bigger brain necessitated a size increase in the birth canal and female pelvis.  These and other physical changes, e.g., the swelling of the breasts and buttocks,  may have paralleled the evolution of full-time sexual receptivity, the establishment  of the home base, and exaggerated sex differences in the division of labor (hunting  vs. gathering), which in turn promoted innate sex differences in visual spatial vs.  language skills. For example, female primates produce more social and emotional  vocalizations and engage in more tool use and gathering activities, whereas males  tend to hunt and kill. Similar labor divisions are evident over the course of human  evolution. "Woman's work" such as child rearing, gathering, and domestic tool  construction and manipulation contributed to the functional evolution of Broca's  speech area and the angular gyrus--which injects temporal sequences and complex  concepts into the stream of language and thought. These activities gave rise,  therefore, to a female superiority in grammatical (temporal sequential)  vocabulary-rich language. Hunting as a way of life does not require speech but  requires excellent visual-spatial skills and, thus, contributed to a male  visual-spatial superiority and sex difference in the brain. Over the course of  evolution males acquired modern human speech through genetic inheritance and because  they had mothers who taught them language.

Spatial skills, knowledge of the environment, and perceptions of the environment were assessed in 93 children aged between 7 and 12 years. Children who were accompanied to school performed as well as their unaccompanied peers on spatial ability tests and showed no greater concern with stranger danger. However, they showed a greater tendency to cite traffic danger in their responses, and a greater knowledge of the environment as indicated by the use of landmarks in their drawings of their locality. Children who had more freedom to travel without adults on non-school journeys also showed a greater use of landmarks. Mode of transport had no effect on the study's measures. These results are discussed with reference to the nature of the journey to school and to other places.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Developmental psychobiology	https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.22188	Efficient joint action requires that we anticipate situational demands both regarding our own and another person's perspective, and adapt our actions  accordingly. Accordingly, when handing over a tool somebody else, it is advantageous  to anticipate our future hand orientation (motor imagery), as well as the future  orientation of the tool (mental rotation) relative to the other person, in order to  make the transfer as smooth and efficient as possible. Furthermore, familiarity with  specific tools might facilitate planning. We tested thirty-two 5.5- to 7-year-old  children on a tool transfer task, asking if they consider another person's comfort  when handing over different tools, and whether tool familiarity, motor imagery, and  mental rotation are related to their grip choices. We compared the children's  performance to that of an adult control group. Besides a rather low performance on  the transfer task, we found differences in children's consideration of another  person's comfort related to the specific tools they interacted with. Specifically,  the unfamiliar tool (a bar) was transferred more efficiently than the familiar tools  (hammer/brush). In addition, the results suggest a relation between children's  consideration of another person's comfort and their mental rotation score, but no  relation with their motor imagery score.

A sample of 160 American sixth-graders from the Replication and Extension of the Pennsylvania Early Adolescent Transitions Study (REPEATS) and 242 Serbian fifth-and sixth-graders were administered self-report measures indexing spatial ability, scholastic ability perceptions, gender role stereotypes, family cohesion and adaptability, mother-child relationships, and father-child relationships. In both samples, mathematics grades were used to index mathematics achievement. As a comparison, grades in English (or Serbo-Croatian) were also used. Findings indicated that among boys and girls in both cultures perceptions of scholastic ability were related to mathematics achievement. However, within the American sample, but not in the Serbian sample, gender role stereotypes related to these ability perceptions. In addition, the family context played both similar and different roles in the mathematics achievement of these American and Serbian youth. Among boys in both cultures the mother-child relationship was more directly related to mathematics achievement than was the father-child relationship, although the father-child relationship was a better predictor of boys' ability perceptions. Interestingly, the role of the family context in mathematics achievement appeared to be stronger among Serbian girls than among American girls.	SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		5	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

Nature human behaviour	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-021-01118-4	Spatial and mathematical abilities are strongly associated. Here, we analysed data from 17,648 children, aged 6-8 years, who performed 7 weeks of mathematical training  together with randomly assigned spatial cognitive training with tasks demanding more  spatial manipulation (mental rotation or tangram), maintenance of spatial  information (a visuospatial working memory task) or spatial, non-verbal reasoning.  We found that the type of cognitive training children performed had a significant  impact on mathematical learning, with training of visuospatial working memory and  reasoning being the most effective. This large, community-based study shows that  spatial cognitive training can result in transfer to academic abilities, and that  reasoning ability and maintenance of spatial information is relevant for mathematics  learning in young children.

Here we test whether these two memory systems are causally dissociable in humans by examining boundary- and landmark-based memory in typical and atypical development. Adults with Williams syndrome (WS)—a developmental disorder with known hippocampal abnormalities—and typical children and adults, performed a navigation task that involved learning locations relative to a boundary or a landmark object. We found that boundary-based memory was severely impaired in WS compared to typically-developing mental-age matched (MA) children and chronological-age matched (CA) adults, whereas landmark-based memory was similar in all groups. Furthermore, landmark-based memory matured earlier in typical development than boundary-based memory, consistent with the idea that the WS cognitive phenotype arises from developmental arrest of late maturing cognitive systems. Together, these findings provide causal and developmental evidence for dissociable spatial memory systems in humans. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

They are intuitively acquired in early childhood and differentiate in further development. However, when children enter school, there already are considerable individual differences in children’s visual-spatial and numerical abilities. To better understand this diversity, it is necessary to empirically evaluate the development as well as the latent structure of early VSA as proposed by the 2 by 2 taxonomy of Newcombe and Shipley (2015). In the present study, we report on a tablet-based assessment of VSA using the digital application (app) MaGrid in kindergarten children aged 4–6 years. We investigated whether the visual-spatial tasks implemented in MaGrid are sensitive to replicate previously observed age differences in VSA and thus a hierarchical development of VSA. Additionally, we evaluated whether the selected tasks conform to the taxonomy of VSA by Newcombe and Shipley (2015) applying a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach. Our results indicated that the hierarchical development of VSA can be measured using MaGrid. Furthermore, the CFA substantiated the hypothesized factor structure of VSA in line with the dimensions proposed in the taxonomy of Newcombe and Shipley (2015). Taken together, the present results advance our knowledge to the (hierarchical) development as well as the latent structure of early VSA in kindergarten children. © Copyright © 2020 Jung, Meinhardt, Braeuning, Roesch, Cornu, Pazouki, Schiltz, Lonnemann and Moeller.

Cognition	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2014.09.004	This study uses motion tracking technology to provide a new way of addressing the development of the ability to prospectively orient objects with respect to one  another. A group of toddlers between 16 and 33 months of age (N=30) were studied in  an object fitting task while they wore reflective markers on their hands to track  spatial adjustments in three dimensions. Manual displacements of the handheld object  were separated into translations and rotations. Results revealed that younger  children largely used a two-step approach in which they initially translate an  object to a target and subsequently attempt to rotate the object to match the  target. In contrast, older children evidence more advanced spatial planning and  integrate translational and rotational components throughout the entire period when  they are transporting the object to the target. Additionally, at the oldest ages,  children show even further improvements in coordinating translations and rotations  by using relatively shorter translations (i.e., covering less distance) and by  avoiding unnecessary rotations of the object. More broadly, the results offer  insights into how manual problem solving becomes more efficient and planful during  the toddler years.

In recent years, a number of studies using different stimuli and experimental approaches investigated sex differences in mental rotation in infants with inconclusive results. The goal of the present study was to examine on the basis of a sufficient statistical power (a) whether infants aged 6 month are able to use mental rotation in a preferential looking task after familiarization with simple 2-D stimuli; (b) whether there were sex differences present, and (c) whether the results depend on inducing an expectation about the orientation of the upcoming stimulus. Our data suggest that the familiarization paradigm is well suited to reveal sex differences in mental rotation favouring boys only when it induces an expectation about the orientation of the upcoming stimulus. If no such expectation is induced, neither boys nor girls reveal evidence for mental rotation. More studies are needed to evaluate sex differences in infancy and, more importantly, whether infant's sex differences are restricted to experimental paradigms that induce the extrapolation of an induced rotary movement. Highlights: We investigated the reliability of recent findings suggesting that male but not female infants show evidence for mental rotation although no expectation about the orientation of the upcoming stimulus was possible. By measuring the novelty preference in looking times, we found no evidence for mental rotation and no evidence for a sex difference as long as no expectation about stimulus orientation was possible. Since the sex effect was only present when an expectation of stimulus orientation was induced, the ability of rotary extrapolation might be the reason for sex effects sometimes present in infant research on mental rotation. © 2019 The Authors.

International journal of epidemiology	https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyn250	BACKGROUND: The incidence of cigarette smoking during pregnancy remains high. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is known to be associated with cognitive and  behavioural sequelae in childhood and adolescence. We assessed the relationship  between maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy and cognitive abilities in  adolescent offspring (n = 503, 12- to 18-years old) using an extensive 6-h battery  of tests. METHODS: Non-exposed adolescents (controls) were matched to exposed  adolescents (cases) by maternal education and school attended. Cognitive abilities  were evaluated using a neuropsychological battery consisting of 33 tasks measuring  verbal abilities, visuo-spatial skills, verbal and visual memory, processing speed,  resistance to interference and motor dexterity. RESULTS: We found no differences  between cases and controls in any of the cognitive domains whether potential  confounders were included in the model or not. In addition to maternal smoking  during pregnancy, we also evaluated the effect of sex and age on the various  cognitive abilities in this large adolescent sample and found that most of the  abilities continue to improve during adolescence to the same extent in girls and  boys, with several age-independent sex differences. CONCLUSIONS: We found no effect  of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy on cognitive abilities of the  adolescent offspring when matching cases and controls by maternal education, the  most common confounder of maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy.

Psychological research	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-019-01249-4	Children's mathematical achievement depends on their domain-specific abilities and their domain-general skills such as executive functions (EFs) and visual-spatial  skills (VSS). Research indicates that these two domain-general skills predict  mathematical achievement. However, it is unclear whether these skills are  differently associated with mathematical achievement across a large age range. The  current cross-sectional study answered this question using a large, representative  sample aged 5-20 years (N = 1754). EFs, VSS, and mathematical achievement were  assessed using the Intelligence and Development Scales-2. Hierarchical regression  analyses were computed with EFs and VSS as predictor variables and mathematical  achievement as dependent variable. We examined (non-) linear effects and  interactions of EFs and VSS with age. Results indicated that EFs and VSS were  distinctly associated with mathematical achievement above and beyond effects of age,  sex, maternal education, and verbal reasoning. Effects of EFs were linear and  age-invariant. Effects of VSS were curvilinear and stronger in adolescents than in  children. Our results indicated that EFs and VSS related differently to mathematical  proficiency across age, suggesting a varying impact on mathematics across age.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0965(91)90081-3	In two experiments, 9- and 10-year-olds and adults were tested on a mental rotation task in which they judged whether stimuli presented in different orientations were  letters or mirror-images of letters. The mental rotation task was performed alone on  48 trials and concurrently with a memory task on 48 additional trials. The  concurrent memory task in Experiment 1 was recalling digits; in Experiment 2,  recalling positions in a matrix. The key result was that the slope of the function  relating response time to stimulus orientation was the same when the mental rotation  task was performed alone and when performed concurrently with the memory task. This  result is interpreted as showing that mental rotation is an automatic process for  both children and adults.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Response time increased linearly as a function of the  difference in orientation of the stimuli, and the slope of this function was used to  estimate rate of mental rotation. At all ages, mental rotation became faster over  trials. Age differences in rate of mental rotation were eliminated after  approximately 1500 trials. At all ages the influence of practice was well  characterized by hyperbolic and power functions. Furthermore, children's and  adolescents' data were well fit by hyperbolic and power functions in which most of  the parameters of those functions were constrained to adults' values. These results  are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms underlying the impact of practice.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1986.tb00259.x	3 experiments were conducted to study developmental change in the speed of cognitive processes. In Experiment 1, subjects ranging in age from 8 to 21 years were tested  on a mental rotation task in which they judged whether pairs of letters presented at  different orientations were identical or mirror images, and on a name retrieval task  in which they judged if pairs of pictures were identical physically or had the same  name. Increases with age in the speed of mental rotation and speed of name retrieval  were both well described by exponential functions, and the rate of developmental  change was comparable for the 2 tasks. Experiment 2 confirmed that age changes in  rate of mental rotation are well described by an exponential function. Experiment 3  demonstrated, on a mental rotation task, a perfect correlation across conditions  between children's mean response times and adults' mean response times for  corresponding conditions. These results are interpreted as indicating that age  differences in speed of processing are due, at least in part, to a central limiting  mechanism that increases with age.

One explanation for this age difference is that processing speed is limited by a general factor common to performance on many tasks. Consistent with this view, speed of many different cognitive processes (e.g., mental rotation, memory search) seems to change with age at a common rate. Also consistent with this view, (a) the correlation across conditions between children's response times and adults response times approximates 1.0, and (b) the slope of the function relating children's response times to adults response times declines with age at a common rate. Possible candidates for the hypothetical limiting factor are discussed. © 1990, Elsevier Science & Technology. All rights reserved.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Increases with age in speeds of visual and memory search were both described well by exponential functions, and the rate of developmental change was similar for the two processes. In Experiment 2, 8- to 22-year-olds were tested on a memory search task, a mental rotation task in which they judged whether a stimulus presented in various orientations was a letter or a mirror image of a letter, an analogical reasoning task in which they judged whether sets of pictures were related to one another according to the same rule, and a mental addition task in which they judged the accuracy of problems such as 2 + 3 = 6. Here, too, for three of the four tasks developmental change was described well by exponential functions with a common rate of change. Results are interpreted in terms of a central mechanism that limits speeded performance and that changes with age. © 1988.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

One stimulus of a pair was presented upright; the other was rotated 0 to 150° from the standard. The pairs were either alphanumeric symbols or unfamiliar, letter-like characters of the type found on the PMA Spatial Ability Test. Response latencies were measured. The primary results were that (a) the speed of mental rotation increased with development, (b) unfamiliar characters were rotated more slowly than alphanumeric characters, by approximately the same amount at each grade, and (c) unfamiliar characters were encoded and compared more slowly than alphanumeric symbols, by an amount that declined with development. The results are discussed in terms of the component processes that underlie developmental change and individual variation in mental rotation skill. © 1980.

review_done	Kail, Robert; Carter, Philip; Pellegrino, James	1979	journalArticle	The locus of sex differences in spatial ability	Perception & Psychophysics	https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03199867	College men and women judged whether pairs of stimuli were identical or mirror images. One stimulus of a pair was presented upright; the other was rotated 0°–150° from the vertical. The stimuli were either alphanumeric symbols or unfamiliar letter-like characters of the type found on the Primary Mental Abilities Spatial Relations Test. For each individual, the linear function relating response latency to degree of rotation was computed. The slope of this function was steeper for women than for men. Further, the distribution of slopes was more variable among women, with approximately 30% falling outside the range of distribution for men. Women and men were quite similar in the accuracy of their judgments, the intercepts of the latency functions, and the precision with which the linear function characterized the latency data. It is suggested that the sex difference in the slope of the rotation function may reflect differences in strategies of mental rotation.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1
database	Kajta, Małgorzata; Wójtowicz, Anna	2010	journalArticle	[Neurodevelopmental disorders in response to hormonally active environmental pollutants].	Przeglad lekarski		BACKGROUND: In recent years, the major concern has been focused on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), which are present in ecosphere in increasing  concentrations, especially since 1950s. Among of these pollutants are dioxins and  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) released during vast burning and plastics  processing, as well as pesticides which were industrial chemicals intensively  produced for many years. RESULTS: In last decade, dioxins together with PCBs and  pesticides have been classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals, because they are  able to alter hormone-dependent processes and disrupt functioning of endocrine  glands, e.g. thyroid and gonads. Furthermore, these pollutants have been included in  neural disrupting chemicals due to their ability of altering neural transmission and  formation of neural networks. Since POPs may persist in the environment for dozens  of years, an exposure to these organic pollutants creates a serious issue for  environmental toxicologists. POP intoxication creates severe clinical problems,  which became evident in dramatic circumstances, e.g. Yusho incident in Japan,  Yu-Cheng incident in Tajwan, Michigan Lake poisoning. Clinical problems have been  recognized as disruption of thyroid and gonadal functions, immunodeficiency as well  as psychomotor deficits and increased occurrence of hormone-dependent cancers. Thus,  knowledge on POP effects on human nervous system has been related mainly to toxic  effects of these organic pollutants. Little is known, however, about the action of  very low, so called background, doses of POPs and their effects on hormonal  homeostasis in developing brain. It is of particular importance, because doses which  are low for adults might become toxic for fetuses, infants or children. Recently,  the public concern has been focused on POP effects on brain function, concomitantly  with the increase in neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, attention deficit  and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as learning disabilities. Although some of  epidemiological data are controversial, most of them point to adverse effects of  prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons (PAH) on cognitive function and, in general, mental development of  infants and children. Studies on prenatal exposure to pesticides demonstrated  increased incidence of autism and ADHD as well as deficits in psychomotor and  visio-spatial skills, which were observed in infants and 8 years old children,  respectively. Psychomotor deficits were also indicated in 6 months old infants  exposed prenatally to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and in 1-6 year old  children affected prenatally by polybrominated difenyl ethers (PBDE). Recent data  also demonstrate the strong correlation between exposure to bisphenol A at early  pregnancy and increased locomotor activity and aggressiveness of children.  CONCLUSIONS: Our knowledge on POP effects on human nervous system seems rather  extensive, but is related mainly to toxic effects of these organic pollutants.  Little is known, however, about the action of very low doses of POPs and their  effects on hormonal homeostasis in developing brain. Therefore, the role of  scientists and clinicians is to recognize the mechanisms of POP action, especially  in respect to prenatal and early postnatal period when the nervous system develops  and is particularly sensitive to hormonally active chemicals present in the  environment.

Early attention to developing children’s spatial ability increases their achievement in math and science, and even nudges them towards STEM careers. Researchers suggest that spatial ability is malleable and can be improved with interventions, enrichment programs, and training activities. If the spatial ability of students can be boosted, it could improve students’ math and science achievement and also increase the likelihood of students pursuing STEM-related careers in the future. Engaging in 3D design and printing activities has been shown to have a positive impact on the development of spatial ability. 3D design and printing activities, when used as an intervention or enrichment for classroom learning, promises to enhance the spatial ability and therefore improve math and science achievement and interest in STEM-related careers. Purpose: The goal of this research study was to investigate the effects of a three- week summer camp featuring 3D design and printing activities on students’ spatial abilities. The study also investigated whether attendees’ gender and grade level play a role in the effects of the summer camp. The main research question for the study was: How does a three-week long summer camp featuring 3D printing activities affect elementary level students’ spatial ability? Sub-questions included: (a) Are there any gender differences in the pre-post gains of spatial ability test scores? (b) Are there any differences between lower grade level (3-4) and upper grade level (5-6) in the pre-post gains of spatial ability test scores? Methods: This intervention study used a single-group pretest and posttest design to measure the effectiveness of 3D printing activities on the spatial abilities of 50 elementary students in grades 3-6. Three distinct spatial ability tests were administered before and after the summer technology camp. Paired samples t test was used to compare the pre- and post-test scores to investigate the overall effect of the intervention on students’ spatial ability. Two-way mixed factorial ANOVA was used to compare the pre-post gains across gender and grade-level groups. Results: The intervention featuring 3D design and printing activities significantly improved students’ spatial test scores overall. Male students showed greater gains on two spatial tests (Mental Rotation Test and Shape Test) than female students. No differential pre-post gains were found for the two grade-level groups. Conclusion/Implications: 3D design and printing activities can be used as an intervention or enrichment to the curriculum as early as elementary school age to improve students’ spatial thinking. As other studies suggested, this would eventually improve students’ achievement levels on STEM subjects, and therefore increase the likelihood of students’ pursuing STEM-related careers.

Research in developmental disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2013.10.003	We compared the performance of normal-reading (N=14) and dyslexic children (N=14) in a chronometric mental rotation task (cMRT) using letters, animals and  pseudo-letters, which are objects that look like letters. In a typical chronometric  mental rotation task two items are presented simultaneously on a screen whereby the  right item is a rotated version of the left item and could be the same or a mirror  version of the left item. The mental rotation paradigm is an appropriate method to  test predictions of two different approaches trying to explain the problems for  dyslexics when reading. According to the functional coordination deficit (FCD) model  dyslexics show a failure in suppression of symmetry in the representation of  graphemic material and therefore cannot decide whether the letter is normal or  mirrored because of an ambiguous mapping between phoneme and grapheme  representations. Therefore, the deficits of dyslexic children regarding mental  rotation performance are restricted to the stimulus "letters". According to findings  that propose the involvement of the cerebellum in mental rotation tasks and a  cerebellar deficit in dyslexia, an impaired mental rotation is expected affecting  all types of stimuli. To investigate the involvement of the cerebellum, motor  performance was additionally assessed because the cerebellum plays an important role  in motor functions and motor imagery. For the cMRT we found that the dyslexic  children show both slower reaction times regarding the stimulus "letters" and  "pseudo-letters" and increased overall reaction times compared to non-dyslexic  children. The mental rotation effect was more pronounced in dyslexic children than  in normal readers. In contrast to previous approaches, the results of our study  support the idea that poor results in mental rotation result from deficits in mental  rotation itself rather than from a decision problem after mental rotation which  supports the predictions of the cerebellar deficit hypothesis. However, since the  impairment of dyslexics regarding mental rotation performance is letter-specific and  motor results show no differences between dyslexic and non-dyslexic children,  further approaches next to the cerebellar deficit hypothesis must be taken into  account, especially in consideration of the fact that there are a number of causes  for the failure in reading.

Advances in cognitive psychology	https://doi.org/10.5709/acp-0187-y	The present study was conducted to investigate developmental changes of mental rotation performance. We compared children, adults, and older adults regarding their  performance in object-based and egocentric transformations. Both children and older  adults showed higher overall reaction times compared to adults. Results were  interpreted against the background of impaired working memory capacity in both  children and older adults. Since mental changes in working memory are mediated by  age differences in cognitive processing speed, cognitive speed is supposed to be the  underlying factor. Regarding both types of transformations, an advantage of  object-based human figures over egocentric human figures was only found for  children, which led us tentatively propose that children show deficits in  perspective taking compared to adults and the elderly.

Participants in this empirical study reflected the culturally diverse and low socio-economic status population found in the school. The intervention program, Leonardo's Laboratory, tapped participants' visual-spatial strengths and encouraged creativity, problem solving, and cooperative learning. Self-perception measures in the domains of perceived math competence and perceived academic competence were obtained for both the experimental (N=12) and wait-list control groups (N=12) for three time periods, using the Self-Perception Profile for Learning Disabled Students. Gender differences were also examined to assess the treatment intervention's effects on math and academic self-perceptions.    The hypothesis that the experimental group would demonstrate higher math self-perceptions than the wait-list control group was not supported. The second hypothesis predicted males would perceive themselves as more competent in the academic domain than females upon the completion of the intervention program were not confirmed. Lastly, the hypothesis that males would obtain higher math self-perceptions than females upon completion of the intervention program was not supported. However, the experimental group obtained significantly higher academic self-perception scores two months after the intervention was completed, suggesting the Leonardo's Lab program had a positive effect on students' feelings of increased competency as learners in school.    Interpretation of the results is presented. Limitations of the study are identified and future research possibilities are offered.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The lack of spatial development could result in students not being able to comprehend embedded figures and conflicting shapes during mathematics instruction. The current study evaluated and compared the use of computer-generated training as a method of assistive instructional technology to enhance spatial ability for students with and without ADHD. The study recruited a total of 50 seventh and eighth grade students with and without ADHD from local schools. The study assessed student responses to two different computer-generated training sessions – static and dynamic conditions. Both conditions included the same text, but the graphics associated with dynamic instruction were animated (moving), whereas the static condition included graphics that were fixed. The findings revealed improvement in the static condition for students with and without ADHD. However, the performance of male students with ADHD was significantly diminished in the dynamic condition.	SK	0	0	0	1	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		4	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

Conf. Rob. Biomimetics, ROBIO - Conf. Dig.	https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO.2012.6491033	Bone tumor ablation has been a viable treatment in a minimally invasive way compared with surgical resections. In this paper, two key challenges in the computer-Assisted bone tumor ablation have been addressed: 1) establishing the spatial transformation of patient's tumor with respect to a global map of the patient using a minimum number of intra-operative images and 2) optimal treatment planning for large tumors. Statistical atlas is employed to construct the global reference map. The atlas is deformably registered to a pair of intra-operative fluoroscopy images, constructing a patient-specific model, in order to reduce the radiation exposure to the sensitive patients such as pregnant and infants. The optimal treatment planning system incorporates clinical constraints on ablations and trajectories using a multiple objective optimization, which obtains optimal trajectory planning and ablation coverage using integer programming. The proposed system is presented and validated by experiments. © 2012 IEEE.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

BMC research notes	https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-021-05572-1	OBJECTIVE: This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to investigate the effects of a simple cognitive task intervention on intrusive memories ("flashbacks") and  associated symptoms following a traumatic event. Patients presenting to a Swedish  emergency department (ED) soon after a traumatic event were randomly allocated (1:1)  to the simple cognitive task intervention (memory cue + mental rotation  instructions + computer game "Tetris" for at least 20 min) or control (podcast,  similar time). We planned follow-ups at one-week, 1-month, and where possible, 3-  and 6-months post-trauma. Anticipated enrolment was N = 148. RESULTS: The RCT was  terminated prematurely after recruiting N = 16 participants. The COVID-19 pandemic  prevented recruitment/testing in the ED because: (i) the study required face-to-face  contact between participants, psychology researchers, ED staff, and patients,  incurring risk of virus transmission; (ii) the host ED site received COVID-19  patients; and (iii) reduced flow of patients otherwise presenting to the ED in  non-pandemic conditions (e.g. after trauma). We report on delivery of study  procedures, recruitment, treatment adherence, outcome completion (primary outcome:  number of intrusive memories during week 5), attrition, and limitations. The  information presented and limitations may enable our group and others to learn from  this terminated study. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04185155  (04-12-2019).

Translational psychiatry	https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-01124-6	Intrusive memories are common after trauma, and can cause significant distress. Interventions to prevent/reduce the occurrence of this core clinical feature of  posttraumatic stress disorder are needed; they should be easy to deliver, readily  disseminated and scalable. A novel one-session intervention by Iyadurai et al. 2018,  Molecular Psychiatry, resulted in intrusion reduction over the subsequent week. Its  feasibility in a different setting and longer-term effects (>1 month) need  investigation. We conducted an exploratory open-label pilot randomised controlled  trial (RCT) to investigate the feasibility and effects of a brief behavioural  intervention to reduce intrusive memories in trauma-exposed patients in a Swedish  hospital emergency department (ED). Participants (final N = 41) were randomly  allocated to either intervention (including memory reminder cue then visuospatial  cognitive task "Tetris" with mental rotation instructions) or active control  (podcast) condition within 72 h of presenting to the ED (both conditions using their  smartphone). Findings were examined descriptively. We estimated between-group effect  sizes for the number of intrusive memories post-intervention at week 1 (primary  outcome) and week 5 (secondary outcome). Compared to the control condition,  participants in the intervention condition reported fewer intrusive memories of  trauma, both at week 1 and week 5. Findings extend the previous evaluation in the  UK. The intervention was readily implemented in a different international context,  with a mixed trauma sample, with treatment gains maintained at 1 month and  associated with some functional improvements. Findings inform future trials to  evaluate the capacity of the cognitive task intervention to reduce the occurrence of  intrusive memories after traumatic events.

Using a theoretical framework, we have investigated the scientific nature of calligraphic brush handwriting as well as its treatment effects on behavioural and clinical disorders. The paper begins with an introduction to Chinese calligraphy, Chinese characters, and the character structures. This is followed by an account of a research-based framework of the psychological characteristics of Chinese calligraphy handwriting (CCH). Our basic research includes measures of the writer's physiological changes associated with the brush-writing act, and the results show that the practitioner experiences relaxation and emotional calmness evident in decelerated respiration, slower heart-rate, decreased blood pressure, and reduced muscular tension. The cognitive effects of the CCH practice included quickened response time and improved performance in discrimination and figure identification, as well as enhanced visual spatial abilities, spatial relations, abstract reasoning, and aspects of memory and attention in the practitioners. Following these findings, our applied and clinical research has resulted in positive effects of the CCH treatment on behavioural changes in individuals with autism, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); on cognitive improvements in reasoning, judgement, and cognitive facilitation; and on hand steadiness in children with mild retardation; as well as enhanced memory, concentration, spatial orientation, and motor coordination in Alzheimer's patients. Similarly, we have successfully applied the CCH treatment to patients with psychosomatic diseases of hypertension and diabetes, as well as mental diseases of schizophrenia, depression, and neurosis in terms of the patients' emotions, concentration, and hospital behaviours. This new system of CCH behavioural treatment has also been applied to users of other writing systems. In summary, the present CCH research has its roots in a Chinese art, has been scientifically investigated, and offers an alternative approach to improved health. © 2006 International Union of Psychological Science.

Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-006-0251-z	INTRODUCTION: Rates of neurocognitive risk range from 35-50% of school-aged children with isolated single suture craniosynostosis (SSC). It has been hypothesized that  early surgical intervention to release suture fusion reduces risk for increased  intracranial pressure (ICP) and the corresponding risk to neurodevelopment. However,  studies assessing children with SSC have been inconsistent in finding an association  between neurocognitive development, age of surgery, and ICP. REVIEW: SSC produces  notable distortion of the cranial vault and underlying brain mass. Although a linear  relationship between skull distortion, ICP, and neurocognitive deficits has  generally been assumed, recent studies have postulated an interactive process  between the skull and developing brain that results in neuroanatomical changes that  are not limited to areas directly beneath the fused suture. The specific  neuropsychological deficits identified in children with SSC including problems with  attention and planning, processing speed, visual spatial skills, language, reading,  and spelling may be related to the anatomic differences that persist after  correction of suture fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Available literature on neurocognitive  development of children with SSC is suggestive of mild but persistent  neuropsychological deficits, which become more significant as cognitive demands  increase at school age. Anatomical studies of children without SSC are beginning to  identify particular groups of brain structures that if disrupted or malformed, may  be associated with specific cognitive deficits. Controlled research investigating  the relationship between persistent anatomical changes and neurocognitive  functioning of school-aged children with SSC is needed.

Dyslexia (Chichester, England)	https://doi.org/10.1002/dys.182	A mental rotation task was given to 27 dyslexic children (mean age 9 years, 2 months) and to 28 non-dyslexic children (mean age 8 years, 8 months). Pictures of  right and left hands were shown at angles of 0, 50, 90 and 180 degrees, and the  subjects were required to indicate whether what was shown was a right hand or a left  hand. It was found that, in this task, the dyslexics did not show the normal pattern  of response times at different angles, and also, that they made more errors than the  controls. It is argued that this result is compatible with hypothesis that, in  typical cases of dyslexia, there is a malfunctioning in the posterior parietal area.

Pediatric emergency care	https://doi.org/10.1097/PEC.0000000000000441	OBJECTIVES: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a worldwide health problem. We have limited information regarding psychological adversities of CO poisoning in children  and adolescents. The aim of this study was (1) to investigate the effects of severe  CO poisoning on cognitive functions, mood, and behaviors in children and adolescents  and (2) to identify factors related to occurrence of neuropsychological symptoms.  METHODS: This study included pediatric patients, who were evaluated after CO  poisoning at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry between January 2012  and April 2013. The patients were evaluated at 2 time points. The first evaluation  was done when they were discharged from emergency department, and the second  evaluation was done 1 month after CO poisoning. Turkish versions of internationally  recognized tests were used to evaluate anxiety, depressive symptoms, attention,  visual-spatial skills, memory, and behaviors of patients. RESULTS: Twenty-seven  patients were analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 11.8 ± 2.7 years (range,  6-18 years). The mean carboxyhemoglobin level was 31.5% ± 7.8% (range, 19%-51%) dir.  Delayed neurological sequel was observed in only 1 patient, who had headache and  tinnitus. We found that carboxyhemoglobin level was not correlated with later  neuropsychiatric test scores. However, we found a correlation between history of  loss of consciousness and anxiety symptom level, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy  session and behavioral problems, and time to HBO therapy and attention problems.  CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that CO exposure duration, history of loss of consciousness,  time to HBO therapy, and the number of HBO therapy session affect neuropsychological  symptom levels and occurrence of attention and behavioral problems.

Despite the frequently reported finding of reduced MMN amplitude in schizophrenia, up to now, studies assessing the impact of perceptual discrimination training aiming to improve MMN measures in schizophrenia patients are scarce. Method: In the present study, the effect of auditory training (AUD, n = 14) on the MMN was compared to that of visual-spatial training (VIS, n = 14) and a treatment-as-usual (TAU, n = 14) condition in schizophrenia patients. Training consisted of ten 50-min sessions over two weeks. Assessments took place before and after training and at a two-month follow-up. They comprised clinical measures and MMN recordings to frequency and duration deviant stimuli. Results: There was a significant main effect for type of stimulus deviance with a more negative MMN to frequency than duration deviants. In contrast to our hypotheses, we did not find training specific effects on MMN amplitude or latency. Conclusion: The visual, as well as the auditory training program failed to result in treatment related MMN changes in schizophrenia patients when compared to treatment-as-usual as a control condition.

Conversational excerpts garnered from around the world trace how parents talk about preferences, how infants’ and children's emergent language conveys their preferences, how children themselves are impacted by others’ preferences, and how they in turn influence the preferences of adults and peers. The language of preferences is used to crack into altruism, aggression, and morality, which are ways of coming to terms with other people's preferences. Behind the scenes is a cognitive engine that uses transformational thought-conducting temporal, imaginal, and mental transformations-to figure out other people's preferences and to find more sophisticated means of outmaneuvering others by persuading them and playing with one's own mind and other people's minds when preferences are blocked. This book is a unique and sometimes amusing must-read for anyone interested in child development, language acquisition, socialization, and communication. © Rachel Karniol 2010.

The aim of the present study was to systematically review this empirical body of literature. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis to review studies on behavior problems and cognitive functioning in CHD. Results: Only older children and adolescents with CHD displayed an increased risk of overall, internalizing, and to a lesser extent externalizing behavior problems. In addition, patients with severe CHD exhibited lower cognitive functioning than patients with less severe CHD, specifically with respect to performance intelligence. Moreover, decreased cognitive functioning remained relatively stable across different age groups. Conclusions: Children with severe heart disease may benefit from interventions specifically targeting perceptual organizational abilities, such as visual-spatial abilities. Moreover, older children and adolescents with CHD may benefit from psychological interventions reducing anxiety symptoms and depression. © The Author 2006.

Three important daily living domains - children's outdoor play spaces, leisure centres and caring institutions - are examined. Empirical findings are made from studies in Amsterdam, where new urban developments affecting children are most apparent in the Netherlands. Conclusions show that developments are both diverse and paradoxical. On the one hand, we see processes that progressively contribute towards the exclusion of children from urban public space. Safety considerations underpin these processes heavily. Children's marginal position in the public domain is further reinforced in the planning and design of new residential areas. Children do not seem to be a factor that merits consideration. On the other hand, never before has so much attention been paid to children. Adults' efforts to give due consideration to children's position lead to the creation of many new domains especially created for children. These give children a 'face' in the city, but these spaces are characterised by privatisation, institutionalisation and segregation. In the context of the Netherlands it is not altogether clear what shape the future will take, but it seems to be most likely that indicated developments will continue.

Behavioural brain research	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2017.06.042	Recent research has demonstrated that adults with probable Developmental Coordination Disorder (pDCD) show similar behavioural deficits as those observed in  children DCD when performing a motor imagery task. The aim of this study was to  investigate whether the pattern of neural activation in adults with pDCD during  motor imagery differed from adults without motor skill impairment. Twelve adults  with pDCD (5 male; age M=24.5 yrs) and 11 adults without pDCD (6 male; age M=26.7  yrs) participated. The hand rotation task was used to assess motor imagery ability,  while functional neural images were acquired using a 3T MR scanner. Performance on  the hand task in both groups conformed to the biomechanical constraints of real  movement, supporting the use of motor imagery to complete the task. Comparisons of  response time and accuracy data showed no significant group differences. Comparison  of the BOLD signal activation maps identified a significant parametric difference  between groups. The% BOLD signal change for increasing angle of rotation showed  greater activation in controls compared to the pDCD group in the occipito-parietal  and parieto-frontal networks including the middle frontal gyrus bilaterally, the  left superior parietal lobe as well as in the cerebellum (lobule VI). The pattern of  reduced activation in adults with pDCD is consistent with recent studies of  childhood DCD that suggest atypical activation in frontal, parietal and cerebellar  areas, and supports the theory that this type of impairment may be associated with  disruption of parieto-frontal and parieto-cerebellar networks.

It also compared the transfer effects of different cognitive training programs to the areas of mathematics learning and abstract thinking and reasoning abilities.    The 2 independent variables of interest were: nonverbal vs. verbal cognitive skill training and comprehensive unitary vs. limited mixed training in both skill areas. The 4 dependent variables were:  (1) a test of verbal cognitive skills; (2) a test of visual-spatial skills; (3) a mathematics achievement test; and (4) a standardized measure of abstract thinking and reasoning abilities.    The subjects were 83 eighth-grade students enrolled in "functional" mathematics classes. The 3 experimental treatment groups comprised:  (1) a group trained only in nonverbal skills, (2) a group trained only in verbal skills, and (3) a group whose training for the same period of time was divided between verbal and nonverbal skills. Three intact classes of students performing at least 2 years below grade level in mathematics were randomly assigned to treatment groups. For a 3-month period, 2 weekly sessions of cognitive training, implemented by the experimenter, replaced regular mathematics instruction.    The experimental design allowed for comparison among treatment groups. A no-treatment control group was excluded from the study to avoid the risk of "experiment bias." The data analysis indicated that:  (1) The Verbal group outperformed the Nonverbal group on the test of verbal skills, (2) The Nonverbal group outperformed the Verbal group on the nonverbal skill test, and (3) Limited mixed skill training was as successful as comprehensive unitary skill training for both specific criterion skill tests. There was no difference among groups on either of the transfer measures.    Without a control group, it is impossible to conclude whether or not cognitive skill training actually transferred to other areas of academic performance. It can be concluded, however, that:  (a) low-functioning adolescents are able to learn specific cognitive skills in a relatively brief period of time, and (b) that mixed training is a more important consideration than comprehensive training in a single skill for these youngsters.

The Annals of thoracic surgery	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.06.055	BACKGROUND: Neurodevelopmental impairments have frequently been described in children and adolescents with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA).  The arterial switch operation (ASO) to correct d-TGA has been used for more than 30  years, and more than 90% of these patients now reach adulthood. However, very little  is known about their long-term functional outcomes. The present study investigated  neurocognitive outcomes and the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in adults with  d-TGA corrected by ASO. METHODS: Neurocognitive functioning was comprehensively  assessed (general intellectual functioning, language, attention, visual-spatial  skills, executive functions, memory) in 67 adults (59.7% men) with d-TGA (aged 22.9  ± 3.4 years) and in 43 healthy individuals. The prevalence of psychiatric disorders,  including depression and anxiety, was evaluated using a structured diagnostic  interview. We also analyzed patient- and operative-related risk factors associated  with outcomes. RESULTS: Compared with the general population and the control group,  adults with d-TGA displayed reduced performance in tasks assessing attention,  visual-spatial skills, executive functions, and memory (all p < 0.05). Compared with  controls, patients had also a higher lifetime prevalence of depression (43% vs 19%,  p = 0.008) and anxiety disorders (54% vs 33%, p = 0.025). Predictors of long-term  outcomes included gender and parental socioeconomic and educational status (all p <  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adults who have undergone a neonatal ASO to correct d-TGA have  an increased risk of cognitive deficits and psychiatric disorders. Evaluation of  long-term neuropsychological and psychosocial outcomes in early adulthood is a  crucial step to anticipate for adapted treatment strategies in adults with  congenital heart disease.

Formative evaluation of a proto-type version of Where are We? resulted in the following improvements in the instructional materials: More and prompter feedback for students, additional assessment tools for teachers, development of lessons to model successful map-using strategies, development of lessons to overcome common misconceptions, and replacement of text-based instructions with a voiceover demo. To evaluate whether the skills practiced in Where are We? transfer to a real-world setting, we have developed field-based tests of the ability to absorb information in the real world and transfer it onto a ma and, conversely, the ability to absorb information from a map and transfer it into an action in the real world. In our reality-to-map test, students place colored stickers on a map to indicate the location of similarly colored flags in the real world; in the map-to-reality test, students place large, colored, numbered disks on the ground to indicate the location of similarly-colored, numbered stickers on a map. Average performance for a class of 24 fourth graders improved on both the map-to-reality and reality-to-map tests after using Where are We? Some children classified with learning disabilities performed extremely well both with the software and on the field-tests, supporting the idea that spatial skills are not closely connected to the verbal skills usually emphasized by school tasks. The persistence of certain kinds of misconceptions on the post-test, and the uneven improvement of subscores representing different aspects of map-to-reality correspondence, suggest directions for improvement in Where are We?

While most respective intervention programs focus on the establishment of domain-specific number skills (such as number sense and counting procedures and principles), there is emerging evidence that also domain-general training has the potential to foster the establishment of early number skills. Here, we will present findings from a kindergarten study showing that training spatial skills facilitate the establishment of number sense in typically developing children. Second, we will present preliminary but highly promising findings regarding the effectiveness of new intervention approaches for the remediation of number fact knowledge (e.g., 3 × 6). Going beyond the well established drill and problem-solving approaches (the first emphasizes learning by repetition, while the latter aims at establishing procedural/conceptual knowledge to compensate for the number fact deficit; e.g., 3 × 6 equals 6 + 6 + 6), we present a new multisensory approach to teach number facts. Our preliminary findings are encouraging and show that associating colors with number magnitudes clearly facilitates the retrieval of multiplication fact knowledge in dyscalculic children. In the concluding paragraph we will provide an outlook for future research endeavors targeted at developing and evaluating novel intervention methods that aim that aim (i) at fostering early number skills and (ii) at the remediation of arithmetic difficulties (e.g. incorporating embodiment into targeted cognitive intervention). © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.

Applied neuropsychology. Child	https://doi.org/10.1080/21622965.2015.1079712	Childhood maltreatment is a significant risk factor for a host of psychiatric, developmental, medical, and neurocognitive conditions, often resulting in  debilitating and long-term consequences. However, there is no available  neuropsychological resource reviewing the literature on the associated  neurocognitive deficits in children and adolescents. This review comprehensively  examines the 23 prior studies that evaluated the intellectual, language,  visual-spatial, memory, motor, and/or attention/executive functions in children and  adolescents following an experience of childhood abuse and/or neglect.  Neurocognitive impairments were frequently reported. Impairments in executive  functions were the most frequent and severe reported impairments, although  intelligence, language, visual-spatial skills, and memory are also at serious risk  for compromised development following maltreatment. However, specific factors such  as abuse/neglect duration, severity, type, and timing during development were all  associated with neurocognition. This indicates that these factors are of greater  importance than just the presence of abuse/neglect in identifying risk for  neurocognitive compromise. Such neurocognitive deficits appear to be a consequence  to the known neurobiological and brain development abnormalities of this population,  suggesting traumatic stress can be a potential cause of neurodevelopmental  disorders. These findings have critical implications for the clinical practice and  research involving children following childhood maltreatment and other types of  traumatic stress.

Journal of physical therapy science	https://doi.org/10.1589/jpts.29.1848	[Purpose] The final purpose of the present study was to propose easy and quick mental rotation task. Since subjects can easily understand mental rotation task that  they have to do, the task is considered to be available in particular children.  However, existing mental rotation task using specific software asked subjects more  than ten trials per one pictured stimulus, meaning that relatively long time is  required to accurately measure. Thus, children have difficulty to keep their  attention during the existing task and to demonstrate their ability accurately. To  address the purpose of the present study, the performance of mental rotation task  using paper was investigated whether the performance has similar characteristics to  an existing mental rotation task using specific software, in order to verify the  usability of the task using paper. [Subjects and Methods] Sixty-three elementary  school participants were asked to determine whether a rotating hand picture was left  or right as quickly as possible and indicate it by writing a diagonal line on the  paper. The total time required judgment of 16 pictures and the number of judgment  errors were counted. [Results] The number of judgment errors increased with an  increasing stimulus rotation angle. Also, the mental rotation time improved with  age. [Conclusion] These results suggest that the performance of mental rotation  using paper has the same characteristics as the existing method using specific  software. Therefore, the mental rotation using paper would be practical method for  subjects having difficulty to keep attention relatively long time, such as  elementary school children.

In the original study arising from an environmental pressures hypothesis specifically related to desert people, and employing experimental tasks derived from postulated cognitive survival requirements of a desert world, Australian Aboriginal children of desert origin demonstrated visual spatial memory ability significantly superior to that of a white comparison group. In Drink water's study subjects were not desert children, but offshore island children of mixed origin; the relevance of the desert hypothesis of Kearins study to such a group is questioned. Nevertheless the relatively good performances of these children (equivalent to those of a white comparison group, an unusual finding in Aboriginal cognitive studies) may indicate that visual spatial skill may not be confined to groups of desert origin. The wider genetic relevance of this possibility is discussed. 1978 Australian Psychological Society	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

These findings suggest that infants have knowledge of physical laws concerning solidity and continuity. However, research with 2-year-olds has shown that they cannot solve simple problems involving search for a hidden object, even though these problems require the same knowledge. These apparently inconsistent findings raise questions about the interpretation of both data sets. This discrepancy may be resolved by examining differences in task demands.

A developmental, multiple indicator-multiple cause, structural equation model was used to investigate sex differences in latent cognitive abilities as well as developmental changes in these differences across the 6 to 59 age span. Females showed a consistent advantage on the latent processing speed (Gs) factor, and males showed a small, consistent advantage on the latent comprehension-knowledge (Gc) factor. Males also showed an advantage on latent quantitative reasoning (RQ) and visual-spatial ability (Gv) factors at most ages, although the latter was statistically significant only for adults. No statistically significant sex differences were shown on latent auditory processing, short-term memory, long-term retrieval, or fluid reasoning factors. The higher-order, latent g factor showed inconsistent differences for children, small, non-significant differences favoring females for adolescents, and fairly consistent statistically significant differences favoring females in adulthood. Findings are inconsistent with developmental theory that suggests males should show an advantage on g in adulthood. Supplemental analyses suggested that methodological choices, including the use of latent variables versus composites and methods for dealing with missing data, can affect research findings. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Multi-group mean and covariance structural equation modeling was used to investigate sex differences in latent cognitive abilities as well as changes in these differences across age. Most broad abilities showed mean differences across the sexes, and all such differences varied across ages. Girls showed an advantage on the processing speed (Gs) first-order residual factor. Girls also showed advantages at some ages on free-recall memory, a narrow ability of long term retrieval (Glr). Boys showed a developmentally-related advantage on a visual-spatial ability (Gv) first-order residual factor, depending on age. Younger girls showed an advantage on short-term memory (Gsm). No statistically significant sex differences were shown on the latent comprehension-knowledge (Gc) factor, or on a second-order, latent g factor.

Infant behavior & development	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2021.101642	Studies show that visual-manual object exploration influences spatial cognition, and specifically mental rotation performance in infancy. The current work with  9-month-old infants investigated which specific exploration procedures (related to  crawling experience) support mental rotation performance. In two studies, we  examined the effects of two different exploration procedures, manual rotation (Study  1) and haptic scanning (Study 2), on subsequent mental rotation performance. To this  end, we constrained infants' exploration possibilities to only one of the respective  procedures, and then tested mental rotation performance using a live experimental  set-up based on the task used by Moore and Johnson (2008). Results show that, after  manual rotation experience with a target object, crawling infants were able to  distinguish between exploration objects and their mirror objects, while non-crawling  infants were not (Study 1). Infants who were given prior experience with objects  through haptic scans (Study 2) did not discriminate between objects, regardless of  their crawling experience. Results indicated that a combination of manual rotations  and crawling experience are valuable for building up the internal spatial  representation of an object.

The present work reports that 16-week-old infants can perceive three-dimensional form from transforming optical projections, but not from single or multiple static views of an object. In a habituation-of-looking-time procedure, infants in a kinetic condition were shown videotapes of one of two three-dimensional objects continuously rotating, on alternate trials, around two different axes of rotation in depth. Infants in two other conditions saw successive static views taken from the same rotation sequences. After habituation, perception of three-dimensional form was tested by presenting the same three-dimensional form moving around a new axis of rotation in depth and a different three-dimensional form moving around the same, new axis. Infants shown continuously transforming displays generalized habituation to the same object and dishabituated dramatically to the new object, whereas infants in the two static conditions showed no differential responding to the test objects as a function of habituation object. Kinetic information seems to be primary in the development of three-dimensional form perception.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	Task not quite typical MR but close	3	5	0	7	7	0	0	1

BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology	https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.12246	OBJECTIVE: To assess whether light drinking in pregnancy is linked to unfavourable developmental outcomes in children. DESIGN: Prospective population-based cohort.  SETTING: UK. POPULATION: Ten thousand five hundred and thirty-four 7-year-olds.  METHODS: Quasi-experimental using propensity score matching (PSM) to compare  children born to light (up to 2 units per week) and non-drinkers. MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURES: Behavioural difficulties rated by parents and teachers; cognitive test  scores for reading, maths and spatial skills. RESULTS: Ordinary least squares (OLS)  regression and PSM analyses are presented. For behavioural difficulties, unadjusted  estimates for percentage standard deviation (SD) score differences ranged from 2 to  14%. On adjustment for potential confounders, differences were attenuated, with a  loss of statistical significance, except for teacher-rated boys' difficulties. For  boys, parent-rated behavioural difficulties: unadjusted, -11.5; OLS, -4.3; PSM,  -6.8; teacher-rated behavioural difficulties: unadjusted, -13.9; OLS, -9.6; PSM,  -10.8. For girls, parent-rated behavioural difficulties: unadjusted, -9.6; OLS,  -2.9; PSM, -4.5; teacher-rated behavioural difficulties: unadjusted, -2.4; OLS, 4.9;  PSM, 3.9. For cognitive test scores, unadjusted estimates for differences ranged  between 12 and 21% of an SD score for reading, maths and spatial skills. After  adjustment for potential confounders, estimates were reduced, but remained  statistically significantly different for reading and for spatial skills in boys.  For boys, reading: unadjusted, 20.9; OLS, 8.3; PSM, 7.3; maths: unadjusted, 14.7;  OLS, 5.0; PSM, 6.5; spatial skills: unadjusted, 16.2; OLS, 7.6; PSM, 8.1. For girls,  reading: unadjusted, 11.6; OLS, -0.3; PSM, -0.5; maths: unadjusted, 12.9; OLS, 4.3;  PSM, 3.9; spatial skills: unadjusted, 16.2; OLS, 7.7; PSM, 6.4. CONCLUSION: The  findings suggest that light drinking during pregnancy is not linked to developmental  problems in mid-childhood. These findings support current UK Department of Health  guidelines on drinking during pregnancy.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In this paper we seek to examine whether bedtimes in early childhood are related to cognitive test scores in 7-year-olds. Methods: We examined data on bedtimes and cognitive test (z-scores) for reading, maths and spatial abilities for 11 178 7-year-old children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study. Results: At age 7, not having a regular bedtime was related to lower cognitive test scores in girls: reading (β: -0.22), maths (β: -0.26) and spatial (β: -0.15), but not for boys. Non-regular bedtimes at age 3 were independently associated, in girls and boys, with lower reading (β: -0.10, -0.20), maths (β: -0.16, -0.11) and spatial (β: -0.13, -0.16) scores. Cumulative relationships were apparent. Girls who never had regular bedtimes at ages 3, 5 and 7 had significantly lower reading (β: -0.36), maths (β: -0.51) and spatial (β: -0.40) scores, while for boys this was the case for those having non-regular bedtimes at any two ages (3, 5 or 7 years): reading (β: -0.28), maths (β: -0.22) and spatial (β: -0.26) scores. In boys having non-regular bedtimes at all three ages (3, 5 and 7 years) were non-significantly related to lower reading, maths and spatial scores. Conclusions: The consistent nature of bedtimes during early childhood is related to cognitive performance. Given the importance of early child development, there may be knock on effects for health throughout life.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Findings from the Millennium Cohort  Study.	Archives of disease in childhood	https://doi.org/10.1136/adc.2010.195917	BACKGROUND: Early child health and development (ECD) is important for health in later life. Objectives were to (1) examine the extent of socioeconomic inequality in  markers of ECD at ages 3 and 5 years; (2) examine whether the ECD-income gap widens  between these ages; (3) assess the contribution of the home learning environment,  family routines and psychosocial environment to observed inequalities in ECD.  METHODS: Data on socioemotional difficulties, and tests of cognitive ability in  3-year-old (n=15 382) and 5-year-old (n=15 042) children from the UK Millennium  Cohort Study were used. RESULTS: Children in the highest income group were less  likely to have socioemotional difficulties compared with those in the lowest income  group at 3 and 5 years (2.4% vs 16.4% and 2.0% vs 15.9%, respectively) and had  higher mean scores: age 3 'school readiness' 114 versus 99; verbal ability 54 versus  48, and age 5: verbal ability 60 versus 51, non-verbal ability 58 versus 54 and  spatial ability 54 versus 48 (all p<0.001). The income gap in verbal ability scores  widened between ages 3 and 5 (Wald test, p=0.04). Statistical adjustment for markers  of home learning, family routines and psychosocial environments did more to explain  the income gap in socioemotional difficulties than in cognitive test scores.  CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that relationships between family income and markers  of ECD are amenable to change. The role of home learning, family routines and  psychosocial environmental factors are potentially important in closing income gaps  in ECD.

Journal of epidemiology and community health	https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2011-200814	BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that experienced racism might help explain observed ethnic inequalities in early child health and development. There are few  studies outside the US context and none that consider mothers' experiences of racism  in relation to a range of early childhood health and developmental markers. METHODS:  The authors used cross-sectional data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study on 2136  mothers and their 5-year-old children from ethnic minority groups. Measures of  racism tapped two dimensions of mothers' experience: perceived frequency of racist  attacks in residential area and interpersonal racism. Markers of child health and  development were obesity; socioemotional difficulties; cognitive: verbal, non-verbal  and spatial ability test scores. RESULTS: There was a suggestion that the mothers'  experience of interpersonal racism was associated with an increased risk of obesity  ('received insults' OR=1.47; 'treated unfairly' OR=1.57; 'disrespectful treatment by  shop staff' OR=1.55), but all CIs crossed 1.0, and size estimates were attenuated on  further statistical adjustment. Perception of racism in the residential area was  associated with socioemotional difficulties (fully adjusted coefficient=1.40,  SE=0.47) and spatial abilities (fully adjusted coefficient=-1.99, SE=0.93) but not  with verbal or non-verbal ability scores. Maternal experiences of racist insults  were associated with non-verbal ability scores (fully adjusted coefficient=-1.70,  SE=0.88). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that mothers' experienced racism is linked  to markers of early child health and development. Interventions that aim to improve  early child development and address ethnic health inequalities need to incorporate  approaches to tackling racism at all levels of society.

Only LD boys with conduct behavior problems were treated. However, two other empirically derived measures of classroom behavior (personality problems and immaturity-inadequacy) were measured. Each of two experimenter/therapists presented seven treatment sessions to three different schools. Rather than investigating experimenter differences, the study was designed to provide a replication of treatment results and lower the effects to experimenter bias. The 2 x 3 factorial design included an attention placebo group and lagged presentation of treatment to control for therapist contact and non-specific attentional factors. Results indicated that fingertip temperature training was not effective in teaching subjects to lower their arousal in posttesting sessions where feedback was not included. Neither absolute skin temperature nor self control of skin temperature were related to behavioral gains. Similarly, neither treatment was effective at improving visual spatial skills.    Both biofeedback and cognitive skill training were more effective in improving interpersonal problem solving ability than either attention placebo or no contact controls. This finding was discussed in terms of the similarities of each treatment. Behavioral rehearsal and guided imagery were important components of each treatment package. Apparently discussing problem situations was effective in helping the subject learn to define classroom problems. Yet there tended to be differences in the solution content of the responses of members from each of these two groups. In addition, among external subjects, cognitive skills training was superior to biofeedback training in increasing subjects' perceived control in academic situations involving failure. It was suggested that cognitive skill training involves a refocusing of attention toward internal cues about the subject and the situation.    When these improvements were compared to behavioral changes, there was no statistically significant relationships. In contrast to previous research suggesting relationships between arousal and problem behavior, and relationships between problem solving and problem behavior, the present findings supported a different view. It was found that that perceived responsibility for situations with a negative outcome, mediated the problem solving/problem behavior relationship. Those subjects who increased in their perceived responsibility for academic failure also had larger increases in alternative-solution thinking and larger decreases in behavior problems. It was suggested that future research using longer treatment procedures be conducted to determine whether self control should be a primary target with children exhibiting classroom behavior problems.

They suggest the development of visually realistic contour drawing using T-junctions for overlap occurs independently. The authors report a case study of a blind young woman, Tracy T, who has had exceptionally extensive drawing practice since childhood. In the case study, Tracy T used a raised line drawing kit to draw objects in various orientations. A verbal protocol was taken while drawing. Tracy T drew a 3D cube in perspective, objects from various directions and figures involved in actions. Most strikingly, she used two-point perspective when sketching the roof of a house from above. Sometimes her verbal comments would outstrip her graphic abilities. Notably, for Tracy T, overlap was a problem, and she left drawings requiring overlap incomplete. Improvisation helped her avoid problems in relatively free drawing tasks compared to more prescriptive ones. The study offers evidence that blind people tackle spatial drawing problems in similar ways to sighted people. tracy t, a blind adult, has appreciable spatial skills and an interest in drawing. Here we find that her drawings generally employ orthogonals, that is, plans and elevations with correct orientation from the observer's vantage point. Occasionally they use freehand parallel, and one- and two-point projection. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and 2009.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Behavior genetics	https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01065974	There is considerable evidence that sex differences in spatial ability exist in adults, with males outperforming females at every age after puberty. It is  difficult, however, to find sex differences in children younger than 13. This is due  in part to the lack of adequate measures of spatial ability for use with children.  We report the use of spatial tests for children that are similar to those that have  shown large sex differences in adults and may be measuring ability comparable to  adult spatial ability. Four tests of mental rotation and spatial visualization were  given to two samples of children. The first sample consisted of 81 children (39  males and 42 females) aged 9 to 12 years. The second sample consisted of 42 children  (21 males and 21 females) aged 9 to 13 years. Sex differences of .4-.6 standard  deviations were found on three tests in both samples. These results indicate that  sex differences in spatial ability can be found in preadolescents if appropriate  tests are used. Measurement of these abilities in children facilitates the  investigation of possible biological and sociocultural contributors to the sex  differences in spatial ability.

The visual perceptual skills measured by the Frostig test were insufficient for advanced reading at the grade 2 level and an unnecessary requirement for high reading ability. The results suggest that perceptual motor training is most effective when used preventively rather than remedially and when the programs are implemented during the early years of development at the time the child is in Piaget's preoperational stage. The study supported an alternate theoretical framework for understanding the relationship of visual perceptual deficits and reading. In addition, it provided initial instructional procedures that can be used in teaching important cognitive, visual spatial abilities.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01579.x	OBJECTIVE: Systematic review to investigate the relationship between Plasmodium falciparum infection and cognitive function. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and  PsycINFO, and hand-searched journals and PhD theses. The inclusion criteria were (1)  use of standardized tests for the specific populations and/or appropriate controls;  (2) clear differentiation between children and adults. Eighteen studies were  eligible, of which three gave information on all cognitive domains considered in the  review. RESULTS: Deficits in attention, memory, visuo-spatial skills, language and  executive functions may occur after malaria infection. These deficits are not only  caused by cerebral falciparum malaria, but also appear to occur in less severe  infections. P. falciparum seems to affect the brain globally, not in a localised  fashion. Outcome depends on both biological and social risk factors. CONCLUSION:  Future research should seek to establish the extent of these cognitive deficits  using culturally appropriate techniques and well-defined criteria of disease.

One of the reasons for these difficulties lies in beliefs and preliminary knowledge that hinder the interpretation of the scientific knowledge, the other reason may lie in the low level of verbal and visuo-spatial abilities. The study aims to investigate the effect of verbal and visuo-spatial abilities, but also that of preliminary knowledge on the later development of the knowledge of the Earth in school. 176 schoolchildren (96 boys and 80 girls) from five schools were tested; the mean age of the children during the first interview was seven years and eight months. All students were interviewed twice - in grades 1 and 2, before and after they had learnt the topic in school. Factual, scientific and synthetic knowledge was assessed. The facilitative effect of visuo-spatial and verbal abilities and preliminary factual and scientific knowledge on students' knowledge of astronomy after having learnt the topic in school was shown. In contrast, the hindering effect of synthetic knowledge was not found. © Springer 2006.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Some researchers have reported that there is a considerable overlap between cognitive and behavioral features of Asperger's Disorder (AD) and NVLD. The present study aimed to assess the hypothesis of the presence of NVLD in AD using a neuropsychological battery, which primarily focused on memory, in a group of children and adolescents from the Turkish population. Methods: 21 individuals, aged 7-16 years, - who referred to Istanbul Medical Faculty Child Psychiatry Department and were diagnosed with AD according to DSM-IV criteria, and 18 age-, gender-, IQ- and education level-matched volunteer controls were evaluated. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, and The Benton Judgment of Line Orientation and Facial Recognition tests were administered to the participants. Results: The AD group performed similarly to the controls on verbal memory and verbal comprehension, but was significantly poorer in short- and long-term visual memory, perceptual organization and visuospatial constructional abilities. Conclusion: This study confirmed that the neuropsychological profile of the individuals with AD is closely similar to that of NVLD. © Archives of Neuropsychiatry.

A developmental amnesic case with focal bilateral hippocampal pathology showed a massive additional impairment when tested from the shifted viewpoint compared with a mild, list length-dependent, impairment when tested from the same viewpoint. While the same-view condition could be solved by visual pattern matching, the shifted-view condition requires a viewpoint independent representation or an equivalent mechanism for translating or rotating viewpoints in memory. The latter mechanism was indicated by control subjects' response latencies in the shifted-view condition, although the amnesic case is not impaired in tests of mental rotation of single objects. These results show that the human hippocampus supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory, and suggest that it does so by providing a mechanism for viewpoint manipulation in memory. In addition, they suggest an extremely sensitive test for human hippocampal damage, and hint at the nature of the hipppocampal role in episodic recollection. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

database	Kinoshita, Y.	1971	journalArticle	The role of mediators in epistemic observation: Especially on transformational representation	The Japanese Journal of Educational Psychology	https://doi.org/10.5926/jjep1953.19.4_193	The present study aimed at demonstrating the role of relevant mediators in epistemic observation of spatial transformation. It was hypothesized that effectiveness of the observation depends on availability of relevant mediators. A simplified version of Piaget's “3-mountains-experiment” was undertaken. In place of the 3 mountains, 2 objects, i. e., a ball and a pin were used. My previous study, from which the hypothesis was derived, revealed Ss felt it the most difficult to imagine the sight from the position opposite their own. Most of the mistakes were committed concerning the left-right relation of the 2 objects. If Ss could not imagine the sight from other angles correctly, they were asked to go down to the place and to confirm the sight by their own eyes. This procedure of empirical confirmation was effective for some children, but completely ineffective for others. The present experiment was undertaken to identify mediators which will make the observation more effective. Two kinds of mediators were selected. One was a verbal mediator. It was anticipated that verbal labels of “left” and “right” can be used as mediators. Ss were classified into 3 categories (+, -, and intermediate) according to their abilities to encode the objects or the relation between them in terms of “left right”, and to deal with the objects following instructions involving the terms. The other mediator was essentially non-verbal. Its availability was diagnosed according to utilization of left-right cues in a concept learning situation. The cues can be utilized when Ss can persistently attend to these aspects. A simple concept learning experiment, using a set of stimuli with 3 variable dimensions, was given to Ss. They were classified into 2 categories (+ & -). All Ss were 6-year-olds. According to the relevant mediators, 4 groups of Ss were selected. They were exposed to a training session which consisted of the observation of the sights from different viewpoints. In the session, a child was required to anticipate the sight, then to go to the place and to confirm his anticipation. No verbal explanation was given to Ss. The results are as follows. Many of Ss of A & C grs., made progress. B & D grs. had a small number of successful learners. It is evident that the non-verbal mediator, which facilitated cue utilization in concept learning, was really an effective mediator in the observation. The verbal mediator, on the other hand, had no differentiating effect, since there was no difference between A gr. and B gr., or C gr. and D gr. It can be interpreted that the verbal mediator was effective only when the observation was accompanied by verbal description or explanation of the phenomenon. © 1971, The Japanese Association of Educational Psychology.

Pediatric diabetes	https://doi.org/10.1111/pedi.12414	OBJECTIVE: Cross-sectional studies find altered cognition in youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, few longitudinal studies have examined the  trajectories of their cognitive performance over time. The aims of this study were  to explore longitudinal change in cognitive function in youth with T1DM as compared  with nondiabetic sibling controls, and how glycemic control and age of onset  influence cognitive performance over time. METHODS: We assessed crystallized  intelligence, visual-spatial ability, delayed memory, and processing speed at 3 time  points using the same cognitive tasks in youth with T1DM and sibling controls.  Hierarchical linear modeling examined relationships between diabetes, hyperglycemia  (HbA1c values), age of onset, and cognition over 5.5 y. RESULTS: Youth with diabetes  performed worse than controls on visual-spatial ability and memory tasks over time,  and did not improve as much in processing speed. Greater hyperglycemia was  associated with lower crystallized intelligence and slower processing speed but  better memory across all time points. There was a stronger negative relationship  between hyperglycemia and visual-spatial ability for youth with earlier compared  with later onset diabetes. Importantly, within-person decreases in hyperglycemia  between time points were associated with improved visual-spatial ability and faster  processing speed. CONCLUSIONS: On average, differences in cognitive function between  youth with T1DM and nondiabetic relatives are maintained or increase during  childhood and adolescence. Hyperglycemia and age of onset can have negative effects  on the developmental trajectories of cognitive processes in youth with T1DM.  However, treatments that lower hyperglycemia may lead to improved cognitive function  in youth with T1DM.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In contrast to the analog account, these theorists view spatial representation as consisting of sets of propositions. This information may be expressed linguistically in locative terms. Beyond this, Olson and Bialystok have made some explicit predictions concerning the difficulty of rotations about three orthogonal axes. Specifically, for three dimensional stimuli, vertical rotation (y axis) will be more difficult than frontal rotation (z axis) which will be more difficult than lateral rotation (x axis). It can be argued that a test with young children who are in the process of developmentally acquiring these locative terms would provide the clearest, least conservative test of this predicted hierarchy.    Thirty preschool children were given two tasks in separate testing sessions, a rotation task and an identification task. In the rotation task subjects had to make same/different judgments regarding mirror image and identical stimulus pairs. Following pretraining, stimulus pairs were presented in three blocks of 12 trials each, corresponding to the three types of rotation. Each trial included an upright standard and a comparison presented in an orientation representing the endstate of a 180 degree rotation from the upright along one of the three axes.    The second task was one in which subjects had to verbally label the location of a red dot on a photograph of an object. The stimuli for the identification task were color photographs of canonical objects. Each object appeared in six different slides in which it was portrayed from the following perspectives: forward, above, right side, left side, and rear. On each photograph, a red dot was located near the object at one of six positions: top, bottom, front, back, left side or right side. The position of the dot depended upon the perspective of the object. In the main experimental trials the subject was asked to identify the location of the red dot and verbally respond with a dimensional label.    Both error rate and response time patterns on the rotation task failed to support the theoretical predictions. A significant positive correlation of.44 was obtained between the extent to which subjects demonstrated the predicted rotational hierarchy and the degree to which they exhibited the hierarchy of lexical difficulty. It was shown that the lack of an axis of rotation effect could not attributed to: (1) floor or ceiling effects, (2) carryover effect from the use of a within-subject design, (3) atypical procedural details, or (4) a nonrepresentative sample.

The British journal of developmental psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjdp.12263	Parents' use of spatial language and gestures is closely linked to children's spatial language development. Little is known about the quantity and quality of  early spatial input and how infants' individual characteristics may be related to  the spatial input they receive. Here, we examine (1) the amount and type of spatial  input 16- to 21-month-old Turkish-learning children (n = 34) received in the context  of a spatial activity (puzzle play) and (2) whether parental spatial input in the  form of speech and gesture varies based on children's age, sex, and early spatial  vocabulary comprehension assessed in an earlier session. Results of the regression  analyses showed that parents' use of spatial words was predicted by children's age  over and beyond earlier spatial word comprehension and sex. In particular, parents  used more spatial speech as their children got older even in this restricted age  range. Children's early spatial word comprehension also correlated with parents'  spatial word production. Yet, parents' overall gesture use and gestures with spatial  words were not predicted by children's age, sex, or early spatial word  comprehension. These findings suggest that in the spatial domain, early verbal  input, but not gestural input, can change depending on children's age and children's  spatial vocabulary comprehension may also be related to parental use of later  spatial language. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject?  Parents enhance their children's spatial skills using spatial language and gestures.  Parental spatial talk is related to children's later spatial skills. What does this  study add? We assess both spatial talk and gesture in early childhood. We examine  the children's characteristics (age, sex) in relation to spatial talk and gesture.  We present how children's earlier vocabulary competence relates to parental input.

Kindergarten children (N=80) were videotaped playing games that require mathematical reasoning in the presence of their teachers. The children's mathematics, spatial, and verbal skills and the teachers' mathematical communication were assessed. No gender differences were found between the mathematical achievements of the boys and girls, or between their verbal and spatial skills. However, mathematics performance was related to boys' spatial reasoning and to girls' verbal skills, suggesting that they use different processes for solving mathematical problems. Furthermore, the boys' levels of spatial and verbal skills were not found to be related, whereas they were significantly related for girls. The mathematical communication level provided in teacher-child interactions was found to be related to girls' but not to boys' mathematics performance, suggesting that boys may need other forms of mathematics communication and teaching. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Nonetheless (third), the concept of “Native American learning styles” continues to enjoy considerable popularity due to (a) educators' desire to avoid “deficit” language, (b) the concept's use in obtaining culturally oriented program funding, and (c) the concept's use in summarizing a variety of instructional adaptations necessary in a cross-cultural context. © 1991, Sage Publications.

Previous research has investigated "why" gender differences exist, and cited social and environmental factors such as anxiety, teacher expectation, and class selection. While external (i.e., environmental) influences on gender performance are important, current research takes an in-depth look at mathematical items, building an internally focused research framework. Item complexity and gender differences at the item-level are examined to investigate plausible mediators of performance differences. It is hypothesized that mathematical word problems will prove to be more complex than previously thought. Also, said item-level complexity is believed to differentially influence male and female performance. Finally, it is hypothesized that relationships to non-quantitative cognitive factors can mediate item-level gender differences. Baron and Kenny's causal steps mediation methodology was employed. Theoretically, cognitive abilities (reasoning and processing speed) are associated with quantitative ability and show gender differences. Once those abilities are explained in the analytic model, item-level gender differences are expected to disappear. A portion of Woodcock-Johnson III's standardization sample was selected and contained (N = 3874) school aged children ranging from 9 to 19 years of age (M = 13.06). The Applied Problems test of WJ-III's Achievement scale was central to item-level mathematical mediation analyses. Confirmatory factor analyses tested within-item complexity and possible mediation effects. Results suggest that mathematical word problems are complex and individual items contain aspects of reasoning, speed, and spatial ability, which support previous research by Carroll (1996), who postulated that mathematical ability is highly related to other cognitive factors (reasoning, spatial ability, and processing speed). Showing that mathematical items can exhibit strong relationships to indicators of cognitive ability further reinforces this link and could be indicative of differential processing strategies. However, the relationship between gender and these item-level cognitive ability associations was not strong enough to validate a mediation model. Future research should pursue within-item complexity and mathematical item-level gender performance differences in other achievement tests to assess previously undetected bias and strengthen the mathematical ability measurement tools.

It obstructs the development of the individual at all levels of education. This research investigates students' spatial and geographical thinking and whether there is a differentiation of these abilities between dyslexic and non-dyslexic ones. For this purpose, 50 questionnaires were distributed to 25 dyslexic and 25 non-dyslexic students aged 14 using opportunity sampling from different areas (rural, urban). The questionnaire included spatial thinking exercises like mental rotation, plan views, shapes folding - unfolding and mental manipulation of shapes and exercises by which geographical thinking is examined, according to the Greek geography curriculum. The results indicated that the non-dyslexic students had better performance than the dyslexic ones in all cases, except one, this of 2D-3D exercise. The most significant difference was in the section of plan views, mental rotation and folding - unfolding, whereas in the shapes mental manipulation, both children's groups faced difficulties. Although the research sample was limited, the results supported our hypothesis that non-dyslexic students would perform better on spatial and geographical thinking assessments. © RIGEO 2019.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00349.x	BACKGROUND: Sex-differences exist in some areas of human social behaviour. In animals, foetal testosterone (fT) plays a central role in organising the brain and  in later social behaviour. fT has also been implicated in language development,  eye-contact, and spatial ability in humans. METHODS: Fifty-eight children (35 male  and 23 female), whose fT was analysed in amniotic fluid, were followed up at age 4.  Their mothers completed the Children's Communication Checklist, a questionnaire  assessing language, quality of social relationships and restricted interests.  RESULTS: fT was negatively correlated to quality of social relationships, taking  sex-differences into account. fT was also positively correlated with restricted  interests in boys. CONCLUSIONS: These findings implicate fT in both social  development and attentional focus. They may also have implications for understanding  the sex ratio in autism.

Nutrients	https://doi.org/10.3390/nu8090579	Evidence from a limited number of randomised controlled intervention trials (RCTs) have shown that a Mediterranean dietary pattern may reduce the risk of cognitive  decline and enhance cognitive function among healthy older adults. However, there  are currently no data in non-Mediterranean older adult populations. The present  study aimed to address this gap by examining the effect of a Mediterranean dietary  pattern (MedDiet) for six months on aspects of cognitive function in a randomised  controlled intervention trial (the MedLey study) that extended for a duration of 18  months. In the final analysed cohort, a total of 137 men and women (mean age of 72.1  ± 5.0 years) randomly assigned to either a MedDiet or control diet (HabDiet) (i.e.,  habitual dietary intake), were assessed on a comprehensive neuropsychological test  battery, including 11 individual tests. In multivariable-adjusted models, the  MedDiet group did not perform significantly better than the HabDiet control group  for executive functioning (adjusted mean differences: +2.53, 95% CI -2.59 to 7.65, p  = 0.33); speed of processing (adjusted mean differences: +3.24, 95% CI -1.21 to  7.70, p = 0.15); memory (adjusted mean differences: +2.00, 95% CI -3.88 to 7.88, p =  0.50); visual-spatial ability (adjusted mean differences: +0.21, 95% CI -0.38 to  0.81, 0.48); and overall age-related cognitive performance (adjusted mean  differences: +7.99, 95% CI -4.00 to 19.9, p = 0.19). In conclusion, this study did  not find evidence of a beneficial effect of a MedDiet intervention on cognitive  function among healthy older adults.

Electromyographic (EMG) activation was compared under three conditions: MI, physical execution (PE), and rest. The task is clinically relevant unilateral executed movement using open muscle chains. Methods: In a cross-sectional study EMG activation was measured in four muscles: M. deltoideus pars clavicularis, M. biceps brachii, M. extensor digitorum, M. flexor carpi radialis. MI ability was evaluated with mental rotation, mental chronometry and the Kinaesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire. Cognitive performance was screened with the Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: Twenty-two participants (11 females, age 52.6 ±15.8, age range 21 to 72) were included: ten healthy volunteers, seven patients after stroke (time after stroke onset 16.3 ± 24.8 months), and five patients with Parkinson's disease (disease duration 60.4 ± 24.5 months). Overall Mini-Mental State Examination scores ranged between 27 and 30. An increased EMG activation during MI compared to rest condition was observed in M. deltoideus pars clavicularis and M. biceps brachii across all participants (p-value = 0.001, p = 0.007). Seven participants (two healthy volunteers, three patients after stroke and two patients with Parkinson's disease) showed a EMG activation during MI of the hand grasping and arm-lifting task in at least one of the target muscles. No correlation between EMG activation during MI and scores of three MI ability assessments were found. Conclusions: The findings suggest that MI can yield subliminal EMG activation. However, that might vary on individual basis. It remains unclear what parameters contribute to or inhibit an EMG activation during MI. Future investigations should determine factors that influence EMG activation, e.g. MI instructions, tasks to imagine, amount of MI training, and longitudinal changes after an MI training period. © 2018 Kobelt, Wirth and Schuster-Amft.

Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2017.00194	Sex differences are consistently reported in different visuospatial tasks with men usually performing better in mental rotation tests while women are better on tests  for memory of object locations. In the present study, we investigated sex  differences in solving jigsaw puzzles in children. In total 22 boys and 24 girls  were tested using custom build tablet application representing a jigsaw puzzle  consisting of 25 pieces and featuring three different pictures. Girls outperformed  boys in solving jigsaw puzzles regardless of the picture. Girls were faster than  boys in solving the puzzle, made less incorrect moves with the pieces of the puzzle,  and spent less time moving the pieces around the tablet. It appears that the  strategy of solving the jigsaw puzzle was the main factor affecting differences in  success, as girls tend to solve the puzzle more systematically while boys performed  more trial and error attempts, thus having more incorrect moves with the puzzle  pieces. Results of this study suggest a very robust sex difference in solving the  jigsaw puzzle with girls outperforming boys by a large margin.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Hormones exert their influence via different pathways and sex steroid receptors are widely distributed within the brain. Several studies suggest gender differences in behavior and cognitive function and have stimulated research on the role of testosterone and estrogen. The overall aims of this thesis were to explore eventual effects of sex hormone treatment on certain aspects of behavior and brain function in postmenopausal women.A total of two hundred naturally postmenopausal women were recruited to four weeks of treatment with either testosterone undecanoate 40 mg/day, estradiol valerate 2 mg/day or placebo in a randomized trial. At the end of treatment, all women were tested to evaluate economic behavior (altruism, reciprocal fairness, trust, trustworthiness, risk aversion, risk investment, risk assessment) and cognitive function (verbal memory, verbal fluency, spatial ability). Blood samples were collected at baseline and after four weeks and analyzed for estradiol, testosterone, androstanediol glucuronide, oxytocin, sex hormone-binding globulin and insulin-like growth factor I.Treatment with testosterone or estrogen had no significant influence on economic behavior and cognitive function. Still, significant correlations between sex hormone levels and some aspects of cognitive function were found. High estrogen levels, a high estradiol/testosterone ratio and increasing estradiol levels during estrogen treatment were all associated with lower spatial ability. It could be that a specific balance between estrogen and testosterone is required for optimal effects on spatial- and verbal abilities. Also the estrogen/testosterone ratio and a curvilinear relationship could be important.Ten surgically postmenopausal women were treated with estrogen alone (transdermal estradiol 100μg/day) for three months and in combination with testosterone undecanoate 40 mg/day for further three months. The influence of treatment on the serotonin transporter binding potential (5-HTT BP) in specific brain areas was studied by positron emission tomography (PET) using the special ligand [11C]MADAM. Serum levels of sex hormones, mood and cognitive abilities were measured.Treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with testosterone significantly reduced 5-HTT BPs in several cortical and limbic regions. Furthermore, hormone treatment significantly enhanced mood and cognitive abilities like letter and category fluency. These data provide novel evidence for the influence of sex steroid hormones on the serotonergic system in the human brain.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology	https://doi.org/10.3109/09513590.2012.705385	Several studies have suggested gender differences in cognitive function, but data on the association between sex hormones and cognitive function are contradictory. The  aim of our randomized double-blind study was to explore the possible relations  between cognitive function and serum levels of sex hormones, oxytocin and  insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in postmenopausal women. Two-hundred healthy  postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive estrogen, testosterone or  placebo treatment for 1 month. The associations of spatial ability, verbal fluency  and verbal memory with serum levels of estradiol, testosterone,  estradiol/testosterone ratio, androstanediol, oxytocin and IGF-I were analyzed.  Spatial ability showed a negative correlation with serum estradiol,  estradiol/testosterone ratio, oxytocin levels and a positive association with  androstanediol levels. Verbal fluency displayed a negative relationship with serum  levels of testosterone, IGF-I and a positive with estradiol/testosterone ratio.  Verbal memory displayed a positive correlation to androstanediol. Data suggest that  not only absolute levels of sex hormones but also the balance between estrogen and  testosterone and their metabolites may be important for cognitive function in women.

Alternative approaches to defining the cognitive signatures of various forms of ID are needed to advance our understanding of the profiles of strengths and weaknesses as well as the affected brain areas. Aim: To evaluate the utility and feasibility of six non-verbal comparative neuropsychological (CN) tasks administered in a modified version of the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA) to confirm and extend our knowledge of unique cognitive signatures of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down syndrome (DS). Method: A test battery of CN tasks adapted from the animal literature was administered in a modified WGTA. Tasks were selected that have established or emerging brain-behaviour relationships in the domains of visual-perceptual, visual-spatial, working memory and inhibition. Results: Despite the fact that these tasks revealed cognitive signatures for the two ID groups, only some hypotheses were supported. Results suggest that whereas individuals with DS were relatively impaired on visual-perceptual and visual-spatial reversal learning tasks they showed strengths in egocentric spatial learning and object discrimination tasks. Individuals with FXS were relatively impaired on object discrimination learning and reversal tasks, which was attributable to side preferences. In contrast, these same individuals exhibited strengths in egocentric spatial learning and reversal tasks as well as on an object recognition memory task. Both ID groups demonstrated relatively poor performance for a visual-spatial working memory task. Conclusion: Performance on the modified WGTA tasks differentiated cognitive signatures between two of the most common forms of ID. Results are discussed in the context of the literature on the cognitive and neurobiological features of FXS and DS. © 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Here we cognitively tested aged female rhesus macaques on (1) the delayed response task of spatial working memory, (2) a visuospatial attention task that measured spatially and temporally cued reaction times, and (3) a simple reaction time task as a control for motor speed. After task acquisition, animals were ovariectomized (OVX). Their performance was compared with intact controls for 2 months, at which time no group differences were found. The OVX animals were then assigned to treatment with either a subcutaneous sham implant (OVX), 17-β estradiol (E) implant (OVX+E) or E implant plus cyclic oral progesterone (OVX+EP). All groups were then tested repeatedly over 12 months. The OVX+E animals performed significantly better on the delayed response task than all of the other groups for much of the 12 month testing period. The OVX+EP animals also showed improved performance in the delayed response task, but only at 30 s delays and with performance levels below that of OVX+E animals. The OVX+E animals also performed significantly better in the visuospatial attention task, particularly in the most challenging invalid cue condition; this difference also was maintained across the 12 month testing period. Simple reaction time was not affected by hormonal manipulation. These data demonstrate that chronic, continuous administration of E can exert multiple beneficial cognitive effects in aged, OVX rhesus macaque females. © 2016 the authors.

Nature and science of sleep	https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S6934	Neurocognitive and behavioral problems are increasingly reported in children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). The impact of treatment for SDB on neurocognition  and behavior is, therefore, an issue of increasing importance. To date, there has  been little consideration given to the quality of studies when reviewing associated  neurocognitive and behavioral problems in children with SDB, and furthermore, there  has been little systematic review of treatment outcomes. The aim of this review was  to provide an up-to-date and critical review of the current literature. Findings  indicate a specific pattern of neurocognitive problems in children with SDB;  however, the pattern of behavioral problems is less clear. Very few studies were  found to provide a rigorous investigation of posttreatment neurocognitive and  behavior outcomes. Despite this, relatively consistent improvements in global  intelligence, attention, and visual spatial ability are shown; however, persistent  deficits in other domains are also evident. For behavior, problems of hyperactivity,  aggression or conduct problems, and somatic complaints improve following treatment.  In contrast, symptoms of anxiety and social problems less consistently improve.  These findings should aid in the development of more targeted investigations and  well-designed studies exploring both the causative mechanisms and the treatment  response for neurocognitive and behavior problems in children with SDB.

The two hemidecorticate groups performed with similar competence if test requirements did not exceed capacities which normal children attain by the age of about 10 years. Unlike the left-operated group, right hemidecorticates were severely impaired on tests of later-developing spatial abilities. After perinatal disease and hemidecortication of the right brain-half, left hemisphere control of processes underlying spatial analyses is associated with developmental deficits in these capacities. © 1974.

The neuropsychologic evaluation was done using the NEPSY test battery  on 37 children with hemiparesis and 13 sex- and age-matched healthy controls.  Compared to the controls, children with left-sided brain lesions had significant  delay in phonologic and language functions, while children with right-sided brain  lesions performed more poorly in visual and spatial skills and in somatosensory  functions. There were more left-handed children in the former (6 of 23) than in the  latter (1 of 14) group. There was no significant difference in cognitive outcome  between children with congenital and acquired lesions. The cognitive outcome of boys  and that of children with active epilepsy was more affected. Overall, the patients  showed impairment in many cortical functions and diffuse cognitive delay compared to  controls and the side of lesion, active epilepsy, and male gender were significant  factors in predicting cognitive outcome.

Analysing the mental processes when solving space tasks, e. g. by means of retrospective verbal reports, two different strategies can be distinguished. The first strategy (called "holistical" strategy) can be described as a mental rotation of the given stimulus, the second one (called "analytical" strategy) is characterised by nontransformal mental processes, e. g. pattern matching processes. In order to identify those different strategies, test items are required, which have different solution probabilities when being solved with different strategies. The "cube tasks" of the IST and IST-70 by Amthauer (1953, 1970) are of this type, as Putz-Osterloh (1977) has found in an experiment. The hypothesis of individual differences in solving space tasks was tested in two different samples. First the "cube tasks" of the IST-70 were administrated to 264 applicants for the pilot job. Data analyses using the mixed-Rasch-model (Rost, 1990) confirmed the hypothesis of an "analytical" and "holistical" strategy. In the second study 2558 pupils of the 7th grade were tested with the "cube tasks" of the IST. A latent class analysis of their response patterns revealed basically the "holistical" and "analytical" strategy and, in addition, four strategies which can be explained by motivational factors.

Annals of palliative medicine	https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-15	BACKGROUND: The use of middle cerebral artery (MCA) angioplasty compared with drug therapy has been controversial. Few studies have reported the correlations between  cognitive function improvement and MCA angioplasty. This study aimed to explore  neurocognitive function after angioplasty in patients with middle cerebral artery  stenosis (MCAS) and objective cerebral ischemia. METHODS: We identified 14 patients  diagnosed with MCAS aged 45-65 years. Neurocognitive function evaluation was  performed by 2 independent clinical psychologists using the Mini-Mental State  Examination (MMSE), Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA), and  Multi-Dimensional Psychology. All patients received general anesthesia, underwent  diagnostic cerebral angiography (DSA) via the femoral route and angioplasty, and  then were sent to the neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) for overnight  hemodynamic and neurologic monitoring. Aspirin and clopidogrel treatments were  continued for 3 months after successful intervention. Complete neurologic  examinations, including assessment with the National Institutes of Health Stroke  (NIHSS), and modulate RANK score (MRS) were conducted by 2 independent neurologists.  The patients received a family follow-up at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the  interventional procedure. Neurologic sequelae, intracranial hemorrhages, and deaths  were recorded as an endpoint. Follow-up clinical and imageological examinations were  scheduled at 6 months after the intervention. Follow-up brain computed tomography  (CT) perfusion or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) perfusion scans performed by  2 imageological scanners were scheduled 6 months after the procedure. RESULTS:  Angioplasty technical success was achieved in 14 parents (100%). We found that 10  patients did not have recurrent MCAS in the angioplasty site and had significant  improvements in the associated brain perfusion situation and cognitive founction as  compared before and after angioplasty. Also, 4 patients had evident restenosis in  the angioplasty site. In the nonstenosis group, we found significant improvements in  the MMSE, 3-dimensional (3D) mental rotation, simple calculation, and spatial  working memory. In the recurrent stenosis group, we found no statistically  significant changes in cognitive function compared with the baseline and after a  6-month follow up. There were high correlations between the changes in perfusion and  the changes in word and picture memory. There was a significant correlation between  the change in perfusion with MMSE (-0.522), spatial working memory (0.655), and  Raven's progressive matrices test (0.637); a moderate correlation with 3D rotation  (0.413), and simple calculation (-0.359); and weak correlation with visual tracking  (0.026) and MoCA (0.279). CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty surgery significantly improves  neurocognitive function in patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis (MCAS) and  objective cerebral ischemia.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.1177/0031512517752817	This study explored the effects of background music on cognitive (puzzle assembly) task performance in young children. Participants were 87 primarily European-American  children (38 boys, 49 girls; mean age = 4.77 years) enrolled in early childhood  classes in the northeastern United States. Children were given one minute to  complete a 12-piece puzzle task in one of three background music conditions: music  with lyrics, music without lyrics, and no music. The music selection was "You're  Welcome" from the Disney movie "Moana." Results revealed that children who heard the  music without lyrics completed more puzzle pieces than children in either the music  with lyrics or no music condition. Background music without distracting lyrics may  be beneficial and superior to background music with lyrics for young children's  cognitive performance even when they are engaged independently in a nonverbal task.

Ninety-six students used Google Earth over a 3-week period to locate landmarks (3-D) and mark their location on a 2-D topographical map. Analysis of covariance on posttest scores revealed that spatial ability was a significant predictor of student performance. The overall results support the efficacy of the instructional strategy and provide insight into the development of spatial knowledge among young children. Implications for the design of instruction and training on spatial abilities among young children are discussed. © 2015 ISTE.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The ability to rotate objects mentally is foundational to various types of spatial abilities, e.g. spatial visualization, perspective taking, spatial relations, etc. (Caroll, 1993). In order to attain and maintain mental rotation skills, the process of explicit decomposing the movements involved during the rotational process is required to embolden learning and conceptualization. In pilot studies, I found when learners verbally confirm the thinking and planning methods before performing rotation tasks, it helps learners formulate a complete mental rotation understanding. Moreover, this augments learners’ abilities to transfer the skill to other types of spatial oriented tasks.    The dissertation study further investigated how explicitly planning as a type of training during 3D manipulations helps learners improve their abilities at mental rotation and other spatial thinking skills. Students from New York City metropolitan area (n=127) were recruited and consented to participate in the study. Using a 2x2 factorial between-subjects design plus a control, students were randomly assigned to one level of propositional explanation (explicit propositional integration vs. without) and one of training environment or rotational method (computer-assisted vs. physical-manipulation), or to a control group (no rotation). In the manipulation, learners operated the rotation of seven distinct stimuli in either single or multiple rotations for a total of 42 training trials over two 50-minute sessions on two separate days. I assessed mental rotation abilities using a pre and post repeated measures of the Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotation Task and two standardized post-assessments, the Surface Development Task for near transfer of rotational skills and the far transfer of the Topographical Map Assessment.   Overall, this dissertation confirmed that learners who engaged in explicitly integrating propositional in explaining their planning process improved in their 3D Spatial thinking skills and outperformed students who did not explicitly integrate their plans to complete the same spatial tasks on both the direct and near transfer tasks. There were no differences on the measures of far transfer. Results from this study can inform professionals ranging from educators to instructional designers as well as child developmentalists and caretakers. By coupling explicit explanations with internal spatial thinking, individuals can improve their 3D spatial thinking skills with prospects for benefits that extend not only into everyday activities but additional activities in S.T.E.A.M. related endeavors.

Ideggyogyaszati szemle		INTRODUCTION: Although significant improvement of motor function following bilateral pallidotomy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease has been proved, the cognitive  sequelae have not been clearly defined. There are recurrent loops interconnecting  specific areas of the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia, suggesting the  continuity or complementary functioning between these areas. PATIENTS AND METHODS:  Pre- and postoperative cognitive function was evaluated in 19 Parkinsonian patients  who underwent bilateral pallidotomy in order to clarify its effects on cognitive  function. All patients were evaluated one day before the procedure and 12+ months  after surgery using neuropsychological tests (Raven Progressive Matrices and Bergen  Facial Recognition Test). Proper performance in these tests requires reasoning,  abstraction and spatial memory, involving strongly the frontal functions. These  functions could be described in terms of the "working memory" concept. Hand Mental  Rotation Test was used as comparing task not involving frontal functions. Scores  were analyzed by Student's t-test. RESULTS: Modest improvement was observed in these  cognitive functions as assessed by Raven Progressive Matrices (p < 0.0688) and a  significant change in the complex parts of Bergen Facial Recognition Test (p <  0.0547; p < 0.0468) was also noticed, but no change was registered in mental  rotation tasks. CONCLUSION: Present data revealed that bilateral pallidotomy is  associated with modest and long-lasting improvement in tasks involving the "working  memory".

This research investigated the overall, verbal, and nonverbal visual-spatial ability of 61 (34 boys) three- to five-year-olds (M age= 57.3 months; SD = 7.9) and the following factors known to be related to visual-spatial ability: grade, sex, socio-economic status, math and spatial activity engagement at home, parental mental rotation, quantitative reasoning, intelligence, and working memory. Results revealed quantitative reasoning and general intelligence were an important predictor of overall and nonverbal visual-spatial ability. Mathematics activities in the home predicted children’s verbal visual-spatial ability but not after accounting for various cognitive factors. Given the highly malleable nature of visual-spatial ability, we anticipated a grade effect; however, this was not found. Older children did not outperform the younger children suggesting a possible ‘kindergarten in-effect’ whereby schooling did not result in visual-spatial learning over time. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Children (N = 63; Mage = 28.17 months) were assessed on their visual-spatial skills and on measures related to visual-spatial skills: intelligence, quantitative reasoning, working memory, and home spatial activity engagement. Children’s mothers were assessed on mental rotation ability. Results found no difference between boys’ and girls’ visual-spatial skills at age two. Quantitative reasoning contributed the most to girls’ visual-spatial skills. No variables were predictive for the boys, though boys with higher spatial activity frequency had higher visual-spatial skills. The differential predictors have implications for the development and fostering of visual-spatial skills, particularly for girls, who may be at a disadvantage in this area when they are older. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

Journal of vascular surgery	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2015.02.057	BACKGROUND: Observational data indicate that carotid artery stenting (CAS) is associated with higher incidence of subclinical cerebral microemboli than carotid  endarterectomy (CEA). We hypothesized that CEA would be associated with superior  performance on detailed domain-specific cognitive testing compared with CAS.  METHODS: Patients with >80% asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis were randomized to  CEA or CAS with side of stenosis balanced across condition. A robust battery of  tests was used to assess the cognitive domains of attention, memory, mood,  visual-spatial skills, motor ability, processing speed, and executive functioning  ≤10 days preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks and 6 months. Tests were  administered using standardized conditions and were scored by individuals blinded to  treatment allocation. RESULTS: Baseline cognitive performance was similar between  CAS (n = 29) and CEA (n = 31) groups (P > .05). Relative to baseline, verbal and  visual memory and attention functions substantially improved in the CAS and CEA  groups at 6 months (multiple cognitive tests achieved statistical significance).  Compared with CEA, cognitive processing speed (Stroop Color test: 9.0 vs 7.3, P =  .04; and Stroop Word test: 9.0 vs 7.4, P = .05) was superior in the CAS group at 6  weeks. Executive functioning (phonemic verbal fluency: 10.6 vs 8.4, P = .043) and  motor function (Grooved Pegboard of nondominant extremity: 45.7 vs 38.9, P = .022)  were also superior in the CAS group at 6 months. Tests of attention, memory, and  visual-spatial skills were similar between CAS and CEA patients at 6 weeks and 6  months. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid revascularization improves memory and attention within  the first 6 postoperative months. Compared with CEA, CAS produces improvements in  cognitive processing speed, executive functioning, and motor function.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Research in Developmental Disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2012.06.009	The aim of this study was to detect the possible relationships between various spatial skills of individuals with blindness. Twenty-eight individuals with blindness participated in five experiments that examined the body knowledge, laterality, directionality, perspective-taking, spatial coding of the near space and spatial knowledge of the far space. According to the results a positive correlation between body knowledge and directionality has emerged. Moreover, body knowledge and spatial coding of near space are found to be predictors of perspective-taking, while directionality and perspective-taking are found to be predictors of spatial coding of near space, and directionality and perspective-taking predictors of spatial knowledge of far space. This finding suggest that future studies should seriously take into account the possibility that the development of a certain skill could in fact be the result of the development of another skill/s. Moreover, the findings support the notion that a delay in the development of a spatial skill may not necessarily be a result of the visual impairment itself but of the incomplete development of another spatial skill. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Cognition	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2021.104640	Recent evidence suggests that young infants, as well as nonhuman apes, can anticipate others' behavior based on their false beliefs. While such behaviors have  been proposed to be accounted by simple associations between agents, objects, and  locations, human adults are undoubtedly endowed with sophisticated theory of mind  abilities. For example, they can attribute mental contents about abstract or  non-existing entities, or beliefs whose content is poorly specified. While such  endeavors may be human specific, it is unclear whether the representational  apparatus that allows for encoding such beliefs is present early in development. In  four experiments we asked whether 15-month-old infants are able to attribute beliefs  with underspecified content, update their content later, and maintain attributed  beliefs that are unknown to be true or false. In Experiment 1, infants observed as  an agent hid an object to an unspecified location. This location was later revealed  in the absence or presence of the agent, and the object was then hidden again to an  unspecified location. Then the infants could search for the object while the agent  was away. Their search was biased to the revealed location (that could be  represented as the potential content of the agent's belief when she had not  witnessed the re-hiding), suggesting that they (1) first attributed an  underspecified belief to the agent, (2) later updated the content of this belief,  and (3) were primed by this content in their own action even though its validity was  unknown. This priming effect was absent when the agent witnessed the re-hiding of  the object, and thus her belief about the earlier location of the object did not  have to be sustained. The same effect was observed when infants searched for a  different toy (Experiment 2) or when an additional spatial transformation was  introduced (Experiment 4), but not when the spatial transformation disrupted belief  updating (Experiment 3). These data suggest that infants' representational apparatus  is prepared to efficiently track other agents' beliefs online, encode underspecified  beliefs and define their content later, possibly reflecting a crucial characteristic  of mature theory of mind: using a metarepresentational format for ascribed beliefs.

Current directions in psychological science	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00521.x	Twin studies comparing identical and fraternal twins consistently show substantial genetic influence on individual differences in learning abilities such as reading  and mathematics, as well as in other cognitive abilities such as spatial ability and  memory. Multivariate genetic research has shown that the same set of genes is  largely responsible for genetic influence on these diverse cognitive areas. We call  these "generalist genes." What differentiates these abilities is largely the  environment, especially nonshared environments that make children growing up in the  same family different from one another. These multivariate genetic findings of  generalist genes and specialist environments have far-reaching implications for  diagnosis and treatment of learning disabilities and for understanding the brain  mechanisms that mediate these effects.

Various components of object knowledge (e.g., object occlusion, object causality) have been examined in human infants to determine its developmental origins. Viewpoint invariance—the understanding that an object viewed from different viewpoints is still the same object—is one area of object knowledge, however, that has received less attention. To this end, infants’ capacity for viewpoint-invariant perception of multi-part objects was investigated. Three-month-old infants were tested for generalization to an object displayed on a mobile that differed only in orientation (i.e., viewpoint) from a training object. Infants were given experience with a wide range of object views (Experiment 1) or a more restricted range during training (Experiment 2). The results showed that infants generalized between a horizontal and vertical viewpoint (Experiment 1) that they could clearly discriminate between in other contexts (i.e., with restricted view experience, Experiment 2). Overall, the outcome shows that training experience with multiple viewpoints plays an important role in infants’ ability to develop a general percept of an object's 3D structure and promotes viewpoint-invariant perception of multi-part objects; in contrast, restricting training experience impedes viewpoint-invariant recognition of multi-part objects.

Neuropsychologia	https://doi.org/10.1016/0028-3932(84)90079-4	One hundred and fifty-five preschool children between 2 1/2 and 5 1/2 yr of age were administered two dichotic tests (digit and nonverbal sound) and three Wechsler  Intelligence subtests (vocabulary, geometric design and block design). The familial  dextral (FD) children around 4 yr and older demonstrated a greater degree of  absolute ear laterality than the FD children under 4 yr of age. There were also  age-related changes in the relationship between children's ability scores and their  ear laterality scores. For older FD children a greater right-ear advantage for  verbal stimuli and a left-ear advantage for nonverbal stimuli was associated with  higher vocabulary scores. Under 4 yr of age, however, a strong right-ear advantage  for verbal stimuli was associated with relatively higher spatial than vocabulary  ability. For these younger FD children, less marked laterality predicted higher  vocabulary scores. It is hypothesized that a cortical organizational transition is  occurring around 4 yr of age and that this transition involves a shift from reliance  on subcortical to cortical mediation, accompanied by increasing callosally mediated  inhibition and integration of hemispheric function. Furthermore, there were sex  differences observed in the relationship between lateral specialization and spatial  ability. As young as 2 1/2 yr of age, the FD boys' spatial ability scores were  positively associated with having a left-ear advantage for nonverbal sound stimuli.  The FD girls' spatial ability scores were not significantly related to their ear  advantage scores for nonverbal sounds but were associated with their ear advantage  scores for verbal stimuli. In addition, around 4 yr of age a shift was observed in  the relationship between the boys' absolute laterality scores and the difference  between their spatial and vocabulary ability scores which was not found for the  girls' scores. It it suggested that the maturation of right hemispheric spatial  mediation may be delayed or inhibited in girls.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

We present one of the largest single-center studies, which was designed to prove efficacy of our low-pressure setting of gravitational valve at all three symptoms of iNPH and to find statistically significant cut-off time for best clinical improvement according to the duration of symptoms. Methods: Sixty-one consecutive patients (mean age 74.9 ± 5.3) with iNPH were prospectively observed from the time of surgery with minimal 6 months follow-up. All patients underwent implantation of the same type of gravitational valve with the same setting—pro GAV with low opening pressure at 5 cm H2O—and were operated by the same team of 2 neurosurgeons. We statistically evaluated gait disturbance, psychological changes, and incontinence preoperatively and at 6 months after surgery and timing of the surgery according to the duration of symptoms and to the age. Results: Paired t test showed a statistically significant increase in MMSE, a statistically significant decrease in 10-m walk test and 360 deg. rotation test (p &lt; 0.0001). The correlation among the change of the MMSE, the walk test, and the rotation test, and the age and time of symptoms’ duration was verified by Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Pearson’s correlation coefficient showed a medium strong correlation between the change of MMSE and the time of symptoms (r = − 0.580; p &lt; 0.0001) and between the change of the number of steps and the time of symptoms (r = 0.517, p &lt; 0.0001). There was a statistically significant weak (poor) correlation between the change of the walk test and the time of symptoms (r = 0.351, p = 0.006). All 3 ROC tests confirmed optimal cut-off for the best improvement of symptoms as 9.5 months of the symptom duration. Conclusions: We proved statistical significant optimal cut-off for the best improvement of the symptoms as 9.5 months of the symptom duration. This study also confirmed successful treatment of iNPH with VP shunting using low pressure setting of gravitational valve with overall improvement in 75% and low over drainage complications in 5% We proved statistically significant increase in MMSE, decrease in 10 m walk test and number of steps test, p &lt; 0.0001. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

Education and later-life education-related factors, such as occupational complexity and engagement in cognitive-intellectual activities, are frequently considered indices of cognitive reserve, but whether their effects are truly causal remains unclear. In this study, after accounting for general cognitive ability (GCA) at an average age of 20 y, additional education, occupational complexity, or engagement in cognitive-intellectual activities accounted for little variance in late midlife cognitive functioning in men age 56-66 (n = 1009). Age 20 GCA accounted for 40% of variance in the same measure in late midlife and approximately 10% of variance in each of seven cognitive domains. The other factors each accounted for <1% of the variance in cognitive outcomes. The impact of these other factors likely reflects reverse causation-namely, downstream effects of early adult GCA. Supporting that idea, age 20 GCA, but not education, was associated with late midlife cortical surface area (n = 367). In our view, the most parsimonious explanation of our results, a meta-analysis of the impact of education, and epidemiologic studies of the Flynn effect is that intellectual capacity gains due to education plateau in late adolescence/early adulthood. Longitudinal studies with multiple cognitive assessments before completion of education would be needed to confirm this speculation. If cognitive gains reach an asymptote by early adulthood, then strengthening cognitive reserve and reducing later-life cognitive decline and dementia risk may really begin with improving educational quality and access in childhood and adolescence. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Zeitschrift fur Psychologie / Journal of Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1027/2151-2604/a000099	Gender differences in numerical domains have frequently been reported, but typically only from high-school age onwards. Recently, we found performance differences in favor of primary school boys in multi-digit number processing. Several underlying factors have been suggested to explain general differences in multi-digit number processing (such as visual-spatial working memory capacity), gender differences in mathematics (such as attitudes toward mathematics), and gender differences in multi-digit number processing (such as visual-spatial abilities). To date, no study has tested the concurrent impact of these factors on the development of multi-digit number processing in primary school children; thus, we applied structural equation modeling to a longitudinal dataset of 140 primary school children. Our main result was that gender exerted the strongest influence on multi-digit number processing, which was partly mediated by attitudes toward mathematics. Furthermore, general visual-spatial abilities (but not visual-spatial working memory) had a strong impact on individual differences in multi-digit number processing. These results are discussed in light of the psychobiosocial view. © 2012 Hogrefe Publishing.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The quality of outside play in urban and suburban spaces is crucial for the physical, social and cognitive development of young children. By analysing three important daily living domains–street, green spaces and play spaces–through observations, surveys, workshops and interviews in the city of Eindhoven, The Netherlands, the paper discusses the increasing need for family- and child-directed consumption spaces in city areas. The data also reflect that though there are processes in place that are progressively contributing towards the inclusion of changing urban lifestyles, concerns on importance of outside play, public green spaces, and safety remain high. It is argued that the role of design along with child-friendly indicators and locally important factors need to be better strengthened when planning future family-friendly city spaces. Initiatives such as co-creative design of public space with children and parents, bottom-up neighbourhood design initiatives (e.g. child friendly routes) are some examples. This paper points out the wider significance of spatial transformation of the city’s needs to accommodate various demographics and requirements. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Spatial abilities may be enhanced through the practice of origami. It is possible that the development of spatial abilities will support the development of numerical processing. The goal was to investigate whether spatial and numerical skills can be developed using origami and the folding of three-dimensional shapes.

In order to investigate this discrepancy in the research data, this study aimed at comparing the nonverbal cognitive abilities of a fairly large sample monolingual versus bilingual girls, while comparing for certain variables, not addressed in the literature. The research question is thus formulated as follows: Are there differences in the nonverbal cognitive abilities of monolingual versus bilingual girls, when measured with four non-verbal cognitive test batteries? According to the literature, first language development can be divided into pre-linguistic and linguistic speech, while second language development is either acquired simultaneously or sequentially. Many theories attempt to explain how first and second languages are acquired and used. These theories on the developmental process of first and second languages can be divided into learning, nativist and cognitive theories. Learning theories focus on the effect the environment has on language acquisition, while nativist theories accentuate the influence of genetic factors. Cognitive theories focus on the child's cognitive development as a prerequisite for language acquisition and functioning. Bilingualism is defined differentially in the literature, which presents one of the major reasons for divergent results. In this study a person was defined as bilingual when he or she was capable of one language function, such as reading, writing, listening or speaking at any level of proficiency. Various factors may, however, influence a person's bilingual status. In this regard, age and method of acquisition is important, as well as patterns of sage of the second language, socio-emotional factors and the linguistic relationship between the two languages. The history of research on bilingualism can be divided into periods of negative, neutral and positive consequences and as such reflects the uncertainty of what cognitive effects bilingual education may have. Consequently, theories such as the threshold hypothesis, balance theory and Think tank theory try to explain the influence of bilingualism on cognitive aspects such as creativity, analytical orientation, cognitive style, sensitivity in communication, selective attention and metalinguistic capabilities. The purpose of this study was to determine whether bilingualism has any cognitive effect on the aforementioned aspects and, if so, whether it is positive or negative in nature. Monolingual (English) and bilingual (German-English) right-handed girls between 11 and 13 years were compared, using four non-verbal test batteries. Cattell's Culture Fair Tests were used to ascertain that both groups had the same mean intelligence.The research hypothesis stated that there are statistically significant differences in the vectors of averages between mono- and bilingual girls regarding Creativity (3 subtests), Perceptual Speed (4 subtests), Cognitive Style (3 subtests) and Spatial Ability (3 subtests). No differences were found between the two groups regarding the Creativity and Cognitive Style batteries. Statistically significant differences between the groups . were found in the test results of the Perceptual Speed. The bilingual children (R = 85,125) performed better than the monolingual children (g = 68,000) in the Repeated Symbols subtest (p = 0,000). All three subtests (Number Series, Figure Analogies, Pattern Completion) of the Spatial battery showed statistically significant differences between the groups.

By contrast, recent findings suggest that even infants can perform mental rotation. Unlike the methods used in infant studies (looking time), our new research paradigm allows for the measurement and interpretation of reaction times. Kindergartners (aged 3-6years) were presented with a stimulus configuration on a touchscreen and asked to bring a rotated stimulus into an upright position using the shortest path. Mean reaction time (RT) increased linearly with angular disparity. The ensuing linear trend was significant not only for the entire sample but also for the youngest age group analysed separately. To exclude the possibility that linearity was due to movement planning, 3-year-olds had to manually rotate a stimulus about the same trajectory without the need for a corresponding mental transformation in a second experiment. Here, no linear trend was observed. These results are interpreted as evidence for an analogue mental transformation in 3-year-olds, equal to the transformation processes in older children's and adults' mental rotation. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Effects of motor action and perception on spatial transformations in human development	Zeitschrift fur Entwicklungspsychologie und Padagogische Psychologie	https://doi.org/10.1026/0049-8637/a000175	Recent studies have ascertained a link between the motor system and imagery in children. A motor effect on imagery is demonstrated by the influence of stimuli-related movement constraints (i. e., constraints defined by the musculoskeletal system) on mental rotation, or by interference effects due to participants' own body movements or body postures. This link is usually seen as qualitatively different or stronger in children as opposed to adults. In the present research, we put this interpretation to further scrutiny using a new paradigm: In a motor condition we asked our participants (kindergartners and third-graders) to manually rotate a circular board with a covered picture on it. This condition was compared with a perceptual condition where the board was rotated by an experimenter. Additionally, in a pure imagery condition, children were instructed to merely imagine the rotation of the board. The children's task was to mark the presumed end position of a salient detail of the respective picture. The children's performance was clearly the worst in the pure imagery condition. However, contrary to what embodiment theories would suggest, there was no difference in participants' performance between the active rotation (i. e., motor) and the passive rotation (i. e., perception) condition. Control experiments revealed that this was also the case when, in the perception condition, gaze shifting was controlled for and when the board was rotated mechanically rather than by the experimenter. Our findings indicate that young children depend heavily on external support when imagining physical events. Furthermore, they indicate that motor-assisted imagery is not generally superior to perceptually driven dynamic imagery. © 2017 Hogrefe Verlag.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	3	3	0	0	1

An effect of motor constraints on imagery was found regarding reaction times as well as error scores. This motor effect was not consistently observed across age groups and conditions. It was not more pronounced in children than in adults, but reaction time patterns reflecting the motor effect depended systematically on age and condition. With kindergarden children, a motor effect was only detectable when their hand posture matched the perspective of the presented stimuli. © 2009 Hogrefe Verlag Göttingen.

The mental rotation of body parts in development	Journal of Cognition and Development	https://doi.org/10.1080/15248370903389341	Motor influences on the mental transformation of body parts have been observed in both children and adults. Previous findings indicated that these influences were more pronounced in children than in adults, suggesting a stronger link between motor processes and imagery in children. The present series of two experiments casts doubt on the general validity of such an interpretation. Kindergartners' (aged 5-6 years), first graders' (aged 7 years), and adults' performance in the mental rotation of pictures of body parts was monitored for influences of internal representations of motor constraints (motor effect). In both experiments, evidence for mental rotation was obtained for each group. Unexpectedly, kindergarten boys made significantly more errors than kindergarten girls. A motor effect was only found in the second experiment, where it was least pronounced in the youngest age group. Our results suggest that mental transformations of body parts do not necessarily involve motor processes and that embodiment may become stronger with development rather than weaker with certain tasks. © 2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01796	Three-year-olds and 4-year-olds have severe difficulties solving standard mental rotation tasks. Only 5-year-olds solve such tasks above chance reliably. In contrast  studies relying on simplified mental rotation tasks indicate that infants  discriminate between an object and its mirror image. Furthermore in another  simplified mental rotation task with 3-year-olds, a linear relation between angular  disparity and reaction time typical for mental rotation was revealed. Therefore it  was assumed that 3-year-olds' capabilities are underestimated. In the current study,  3-year-olds were trained in two isolated sessions to solve standard mental rotation  tasks and were tested in a third session. Three-year-olds solved this test above  chance as a group - a substantial number of them doing so on an individual level.  However, a linear relation between angular disparity and reaction time, that would  indicate an analog mental transformation, was not discernable. Nevertheless, these  findings are in accordance with a continuous line describing mental rotation in  infants and older children. And, these also indicate that children's mental rotation  capabilities might be underestimated.	SK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	uploaded to include folder	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		7	3	0	3	3	1	0	0

The British journal of developmental psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjdp.12228	Adults' mental rotation performance with body-like stimuli is enhanced if these stimuli are anatomically compatible with a human body, but decreased by anatomically  incompatible stimuli. In this study, we investigated these effects for  kindergartners and first-graders: When asked to mentally rotate cube configurations  attached with human body parts in an anatomically compatible way, allowing for the  projection of a human body, children performed better than with pure cube  combinations. By contrast, when body parts were attached in an anatomically  incompatible way, disallowing the projection of a human body, children performed  worse than with pure combinations. This experiment is of specific interest against  the background of two different theoretical approaches concerning imagery and the  motor system in development: One approach assumes an increasing integration of motor  processes and imagery over time that enables older children and adults to  requisition motor resources for imagery processes, while the other postulates that  imagery stems from early sensorimotor processes in the first place, and is  disentangled from it over time. The finding that children of the two age groups  tested show exactly the same effects as adults when mentally rotating anatomically  compatible and incompatible stimuli is interpreted in favour of the latter approach.  Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? In mental rotation,  adults perform better when rotating anatomically possible stimuli as compared to  rotating standard cube combinations. Performance is worse when rotating anatomically  impossible stimuli. What does this study add? The present study shows that  children's mental transformations mirror those of adults in these respects. In case  of the anatomically impossible stimuli, this highlights an inflexible use of  embodiment in both age groups. This is in line with the Piagetian assumption of  imagery being based on sensorimotor processes.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	only kindergartners > 5 y included	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

According to Newcombe, Uttal, and Sauter (2013), spatial development includes (1) the development of intraobject representations with the ability to transform them by mental rotation, and (2) the development of interobject representations with the ability to find and predict certain object locations. Infants' remarkable improvements of these two strands of spatial object processing raise the major question of which factors may drive them. In this article, we discuss the extent to which infants' development of intra- and interobject representations is related to their emerging motor skills. In particular, we provide a review on how far infants' development of mental object rotation ability and their ability to localize objects are related to their manual object exploration and locomotion skills. We document a bulk of evidence suggesting such a link between infants' motor development and their spatial object processing and also discuss and critically reconsider the implications of these studies. © 2017 Human Kinetics, Inc.

Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-006-0604-5	Mental rotation is a complex cognitive skill depending on the manipulation of mental representations. We aimed to investigate the maturing neuronal network for mental  rotation by measuring brain activation in 20 children and 20 adults using functional  magnetic resonance imaging. Our results indicate that brain activation patterns are  very similar between children and adults. However, adults exhibit stronger  activation in the left intraparietal sulcus compared to children. This finding  suggests a shift of activation from a predominantly right parietal activation in  children to a bilateral activation pattern in adults. Furthermore, adults show a  deactivation of the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, which is not observed  in children. In conclusion, developmental changes of brain activation during mental  rotation are leading to a bilateral parietal activation pattern and faster  performance.

However, physical education has a range of objectives and represents only 2 percent of young person’s waking time, at least half of which involves only light physical activity. While physical education plays an important role in children’s learning about health and physical activity, it should only be considered as part of a whole-school approach. Whole-school interventions are identified as one of seven investments that work for the promotion of physical activity by the Global Advocacy for Physical Activity.

For example, correlations between spatial skills and arithmetic performance have been observed among children at all levels of arithmetic ability (i.e., arithmetic learning disabled to mathematically gifted). In the present experiments, Baddeley's model of working memory was used as a framework to assess the hypothesis that codes associated with the visuo-spatial sketchpad mediate performance on a complex addition task. In the first experiment, adults solved double- plus single-digit arithmetic problems (e.g., 35 + 7) while also retaining either a verbal or a spatial working-memory load. The most intriguing finding was that less-skilled subjects showed improved performance in the experimental condition that would be expected to be most demanding of a visuo-spatial code. It was hypothesized that subjects' improved performance could be attributed to a shift in the types of solution strategies used to solve the addition problems: From relatively demanding procedural strategies (e.g., counting) to less-demanding retrieval strategies (e.g., direct retrieval of the sum). In the second experiment the strategy shift hypothesis was tested using a similar experimental procedure, in which subjects also reported the strategy used to solve the addition problem. The analyses of the strategy data supported the strategy-shift hypothesis: Less-skilled subjects reported relying more on retrieval strategies in the experimental condition most demanding of visuo-spatial codes than in the less demanding conditions. It was also hypothesized that children's arithmetic performance may be more dependent on visuo-spatial codes than that of adults. In the third experiment, sixth grade children completed the same set of problems completed by adults in the first experiment. Overall the problems were more difficult for children than for adults. Again, a subgroup of subjects showed improved performance in the condition most demanding of visuo-spatial codes; in this experiment, however, it was skilled subjects who shoed improved performance. These results support the hypothesis that visuo-spatial codes are involved in arithmetic performance, and suggest that particular sub-groups of subjects are especially reliant on spatially-mediated solution strategies.

Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry	https://doi.org/10.1097/00006324-200304000-00009	PURPOSE: Children may perform poorly on a test of visual-motor integration due to deficits in one or more of the following: visual analysis/visual spatial ability,  motor coordination, visual conceptualization, or visual-motor integration. The VMI  Supplemental Developmental Test of Visual Perception (VP) and VMI Supplemental  Developmental Test of Motor Coordination (MC) were developed to help differentiate  between such difficulties after administration of the Beery-Buktenica Developmental  Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI). However, the clinical value of the VMI  supplemental tests has not been reported. METHOD: The VMI, VP, and MC were  administered to 193 children (mean age = 8.77 years). RESULTS: Multiple linear  regression revealed that the supplemental tests were significantly related to the  VMI (VP: beta = 0.212 +/- 0.044, p < 0.001; MC: beta = 0.422 +/- 0.299, p < 0.001)  but explained only 36.2% of the variance in the VMI. Poor performance was defined as  a score >1 SD below the mean for study population norms and below the 16th  percentile for published norms. Using study population norms, 35 children did poorly  on the VMI, 20% of whom scored poorly on VP, 14.3% of whom scored poorly on MC,  17.1% of whom scored poorly on both supplemental tests, and 48.6% of whom scored  within normal on both supplemental tests. Using the published norms, 40 children  scored poorly on the VMI. Twenty-eight children scored poorly on VP, 39% of whom  scored within normal on the VMI. Fifty-six children scored poorly on MC, 54% of whom  scored within normal on the VMI. CONCLUSION: There was a significant amount of  variance in performance on the VMI that was not explained by performance on the  tests of VP or MC alone. Each area should be individually assessed during the visual  perceptual examination of children, regardless of performance on the VMI. Even  children who perform within normal limits on the VMI may show a deficit in VP or MC.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

BMI does not, however, distinguish fat-free and metabolically harmful fat tissue. Hence, we examined the associations between childhood cognitive abilities and body fat percentage (BF%) in young adulthood.Methods:Participants of the Arvo Ylppö Longitudinal Study (n=816) underwent tests of general reasoning, visuomotor integration, verbal competence and language comprehension (M=100; s.d.=15) at the age of 56 months. At the age of 25 years, they underwent a clinical examination, including measurements of BF% by the InBody 3.0 eight-polar tactile electrode system, weight and height from which BMI (kg m-2) was calculated and waist circumference (cm).Results:After adjustments for sex, age and BMI-for-age s.d. score at 56 months, lower general reasoning and visuomotor integration in childhood predicted higher BMI (kg m-2) increase per s.d. unit decrease in cognitive ability (-0.32, 95% confidence interval -0.60,-0.05; -0.45, -0.75,-0.14, respectively) and waist circumference (cm) increase per s.d. unit decrease in cognitive ability (-0.84, -1.56,-0.11; -1.07,-1.88,-0.26, respectively) in adulthood. In addition, lower visuomotor integration predicted higher BF% per s.d. unit decrease in cognitive ability (-0.62,-1.14,-0.09). Associations between general reasoning and BMI/waist were attenuated when adjusted for smoking, alcohol consumption, intake of fruits and vegetables and physical activity in adulthood, and all associations, except for visuomotor integration and BMI, were attenuated when adjusted for parental and/or own attained education and/or birth weight.Conclusions:Of the measured childhood cognitive abilities, only lower visuomotor integration was associated with BF% in adulthood. This challenges the view that cognitive ability, at least when measured in early childhood, poses a risk for adiposity in adulthood, as characterized by higher BF%. © The Author(s) 2016.

Various studies have provided evidence that individuals with autism perceive the details of stimuli before the gestalt, the reverse of the typical pattern of visual processing. This study used the Rey Osterreith Complex Figure (ROCF) task and an objective scoring system to examine local/global processing approaches to its reproduction in 37 individuals diagnosed with high-functioning autism (HFA) compared to 49 age-, IQ-, and gender-matched typically developing controls (TD). The sample was divided into children (aged 8-14 years) and adolescents/adults (aged 15-47 years) to assess age effects. Results showed no difference in overall performance on the ROCF between HFA and TD children. TD participants displayed improved organizational and planning skills with age and a shift to global processing approaches, but there were no differences in performance between children and adolescents/adults with HFA. There was no evidence of enhanced local processing in either HFA group. These findings suggest that HFA individuals with average IQ scores do not have the clinically demonstrable evidence of the enhanced local processing thought to reflect increased local brain connectivity in more severely autistic individuals. The deficient global processing of the HFA adults reflects dependence of performance on impaired strategic problem-solving abilities, which has been demonstrated to result from under development of neural connectivity between visuo-spatial and frontal brain regions in HFA adults. © 2009 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence	https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.170	Existing approaches to template-based visual tracking, in which the objective is to continuously estimate the spatial transformation parameters of an object template  over video frames, have primarily been based on deterministic optimization, which as  is well-known can result in convergence to local optima. To overcome this limitation  of the deterministic optimization approach, in this paper we present a novel  particle filtering approach to template-based visual tracking. We formulate the  problem as a particle filtering problem on matrix Lie groups, specifically the  three-dimensional Special Linear group SL(3) and the two-dimensional affine group  Aff(2). Computational performance and robustness are enhanced through a number of  features: (i) Gaussian importance functions on the groups are iteratively  constructed via local linearization; (ii) the inverse formulation of the Jacobian  calculation is used; (iii) template resizing is performed; and (iv) parent-child  particles are developed and used. Extensive experimental results using challenging  video sequences demonstrate the enhanced performance and robustness of our particle  filtering-based approach to template-based visual tracking. We also show that our  approach outperforms several state-of-the-art template-based visual tracking methods  via experiments using the publicly available benchmark data set.

This interest is focused on individual differences in exposure to agents that may harm or protect cognitive function. Caffeine is used as a short acting mental stimulant and may possess longer-term properties that protect against age-related decline and, possibly, AD. The current study aimed to: 1) examine current cognitive function in a narrow age range sample (n=351) without dementia (MMSE>25) who are, by reason of age, entering the period of increased risk of AD; and 2) link cognitive function to self-reported intake of caffeine and socioeconomic status (SES). Possible confounding by gender, childhood intelligence, education, and symptoms of anxiety and depression was introduced into the statistical model. There were significant differences between SES groups in caffeine intake (p< 0.05) and cognitive performance (p< 0.001). Higher quartiles of caffeine intake were associated with slower digit symbol speed (F =3.38, p< 0.02) but this finding was removed after allowing for SES. The results are discussed in terms of the withdrawal effects of caffeine during cognitive testing and strong links between SES and cognitive performance. No evidence in support of cognitive enhancing effects of caffeine was found. © 2010 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The task administered to 56 subjects required them to imagine the folding, hole-punching, and unfolding of paper, depicted in a sequence of line drawings. Analysis concentrated on the kinds of errors subjects made as a function of both item characteristics and ability levels. It was found that a small set of error types produced most of the errors, and that the errors that best discriminated between high and low spatial ability subjects were errors involving the forgetting of presented information. Analysis of latency differences at various processing stages suggested that besides the ability to remember material, spatial ability is related to the speed with which material can be encoded into the memory system. The pattern of latencies for different groups suggested that low ability subjects failed to rehearse memorial information sufficiently or failed to properly encode folding patterns, thus resulting in excessively long latencies at later processing stages when the necessary material had to be retrieved. There was some evidence that as item demands increased, low ability groups abandoned solution attempts when the amount of information exceeded memory capacity. A convergence of evidence suggested that high ability subjects constructed a complete representation of the solution pattern before going on to the response stage, whereas lower ability groups constructed only a partial representation. Also, experience with paper folding items and treatments may have raised scores on a related test of spatial ability, the Surface Development test, which was administered both two months prior to and immediately following the paper folding session. To account for these and other results a model of saptial thinking and a model of individual differences were presented. The spatial thinking model is compared to other accounts and it is suggested that the goals of a theory of spatial ability are not the same as the goals of some theories of visual information processing and some theories of imagery. The proposed spatial thinking and individual differences model is analyzed with respect to the general-process vs. domain-specific-knowledge controversy.

The Clinical neuropsychologist	https://doi.org/10.1080/13854040802572426	Drawing ability is a complex cognitive process that involves different aspects of visuo-spatial skills. To date, the link between these functions has not been deeply  investigated because of the absence of a standardized test that globally analyzes  the basic aspects of visuo-spatial processes. The aim of this study was to examine  the dimensionality, reliability, and validity of a new battery assessing basic  visuo-spatial abilities implied in drawing tasks. A total of 370 children (aged 4-11  years) participated in the study. In order to analyze the psychometric properties of  the battery subscales, data were analyzed with a Rasch model and compared with other  standardized tests. For each subscale items were compared and ordered on the latent  trait, and the misfitting items eliminated. The results of this study provide  evidence for the reliability and validity of the battery, and indicate that the  battery can be a valid tool for researchers interested in investigating the  development of visuo-spatial abilities and the relationship between basic  visuo-spatial abilities and general cognitive abilities.

This research aims to verify the effectiveness of educational robotics on the mental processes of planning and problem solving. Robotics education involved in a curricular laboratory (10 meetings, two hours each, once a week) with 15 children, attending their fifth year at primary school. The proposed methodology was divided into three phases: Pre-test, Practice and Post-Test. The main finding was a significant improvement in visuo-spatial attention and a significant effect on robot programming skills. These data provide scientific support to the hypothesis that robotics activities are suitable in progressively improving abilities in planning and controlling complex tasks in children, fostering executive functions development. © 2018, Interactive Media Institute.

Archives of Disease in Childhood	https://doi.org/10.1136/adc.77.2.140	This study was designed to look at the differences in visuospatial abilities between boys and girls before they can speak fluently. At the mandatory two year follow up visit, children were given the opportunity to build a tower and a bridge. In children whose birth weight was ≤ 2500 g, the capacity for erecting a tower was the same in both sexes, but for building a bridge striking differences were noted according to their sex. Among the 376 children of this category, 41 out of 199 boys (21%) were able to build a bridge in comparison with 15 out of 177 girls (8%). This difference is highly significant. In children whose birth weight was ≤ 2500 g, no differences were noted either for building a tower or a bridge. By showing that boys outnumber girls among the most skilled toddlers in spatial abilities, this work confirmed the action of a male related factor on cerebral lateralisation.

Anatomical sciences education	https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.2057	Three-dimensional (3D) digital anatomical models show potential to demonstrate complex anatomical relationships; however, the literature is inconsistent as to  whether they are effective in improving the anatomy performance, particularly for  students with low spatial visualization ability (Vz). This study investigated the  educational effectiveness of a 3D stereoscopic model of the pelvis, and the  relationship between learning with 3D models and Vz. It was hypothesized that  participants learning with a 3D pelvis model would outperform participants learning  with a two-dimensional (2D) visualization or cadaveric specimen on a spatial anatomy  test, particularly when comparing those with low Vz. Participants (n = 64) were  stratified into three experimental groups, who each attended a learning session with  either a 3D stereoscopic model (n = 21), 2D visualization (n = 21), or cadaveric  specimen (n = 22) of the pelvis. Medical and pre-medical student participants  completed a multiple-choice pre-test and post-test during their respective learning  session, and a long-term retention (LTR) test 2 months later. Results showed no  difference in anatomy test improvement or LTR performance between the experimental  groups. A simple linear regression analysis showed that within the 3D group,  participants with high Vz tended to retain more than those with low Vz on the LTR  test (R(2)  = 0.31, P = 0.01). The low Vz participants may be cognitively overloaded  by the complex spatial cues from the 3D stereoscopic model. Results of this study  should inform resource selection and curriculum design for health professional  students, with attention to the impact of Vz on learning.

Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS	https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617716000321	OBJECTIVES: Visuospatial processing deficits have been reported in Huntington's disease (HD). To date, no study has examined associations between visuospatial  cognition and posterior brain findings in HD. METHODS: We compared 119 premanifest  (55> and 64<10.8 years to expected disease onset) and 104 early symptomatic (59  stage-1 and 45 stage-2) gene carriers, with 110 controls on visual search and mental  rotation performance at baseline and 12 months. In the disease groups, we also  examined associations between task performance and disease severity, functional  capacity and structural brain measures. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, there were  strong differences between all disease groups and controls on visual search, and  between diagnosed groups and controls on mental rotation accuracy. Only the  premanifest participants close to onset took longer than controls to respond  correctly to mental rotation. Visual search negatively correlated with disease  burden and motor symptoms in diagnosed individuals, and positively correlated with  functional capacity. Mental rotation ("same") was negatively correlated with motor  symptoms in stage-2 individuals, and positively correlated with functional capacity.  Visual search and mental rotation were associated with parieto-occipital  (pre-/cuneus, calcarine, lingual) and temporal (posterior fusiform) volume and  cortical thickness. Longitudinally, visual search deteriorated over 12 months in  stage-2 individuals, with no evidence of declines in mental rotation. CONCLUSIONS:  Our findings provide evidence linking early visuospatial deficits to functioning and  posterior cortical dysfunction in HD. The findings are important since large  research efforts have focused on fronto-striatal mediated cognitive changes, with  little attention given to aspects of cognition outside of these areas.

Learning and individual differences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2005.12.001	We report on a longitudinal study designed to assess possible sex differences in math achievement, math ability, and math-related tasks during the primary school age  years. Participants included over 200 children from one public school district.  Annual assessments included measures of math ability, math calculation achievement  scores, rapid naming and decoding tasks, visual perception tests, visual motor  tasks, and reading skills. During select years of the study we also administered  tests of counting and math facts skills. We examined whether girls or boys were  overrepresented among the bottom or top performers on any of these tasks, relative  to their peers, and whether growth rates or predictors of math-related skills  differed for boys and girls. Our findings support the notion that sex differences in  math are minimal or nonexistent on standardized psychometric tests routinely given  in assessments of primary school age children. There was no persistent finding  suggesting a male or female advantage in math performance overall, during any single  year of the study, or in any one area of math or spatial skills. Growth rates for  all skills, and early correlates of later math performance, were comparable for boys  and girls. The findings fail to support either persistent or emerging sex  differences on non-specialized math ability measures during the primary school age  years.

Perception	https://doi.org/10.1068/p6313	In two experiments, we compared the performance of normal-reading (n = 26) and dyslexic children (n = 22) in discriminating letters from their mirrored images. In  experiment 1, they were always presented in the upright orientation; in experiment  2, they were presented in different angular orientations (0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180  degrees). In order to determine whether task and dyslexia affect reaction times in  early or late stages of processing, a dual-task paradigm was adopted in which the  primary task was tone discrimination. Stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between first  and second task was systematically varied (50 ms versus 400 ms). In both experiments  dyslexics were slower overall than controls. No effects of mirror-image letters were  found. In experiment 2, mental-rotation effects were additive with SOA. In  accordance with earlier findings we concluded that the mental-rotation effect  involves central processing capacity. Mental-rotation effects were the same for  normal-reading and dyslexic children; mental rotation is not impaired in dyslexia.  Remarkably, SOA effects were larger in normal readers than in dyslexics. This result  was explained by observing that dyslexics experience decision difficulties already  on the first task. As a result, they do not benefit optimally from increased  latencies between first and second tasks.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, few studies have been conducted on children with VL. OBJECTIVE: We investigated for the first time, the impact of a VL on children's cognition. METHODS: 13 children with VL (10 years, 5 months) and 60 average-age matched controls performed a neuropsychological assessment consisting of visuospatial working memory, selective visual attention, mental rotation and space orientation tasks. RESULTS: Children with VL recalled smaller sequences for both forward and backward memory subtasks (mean±SD = 6.3±1.9 and 5.3±2.6) than controls (8.2±2.3 and 7.3±2.0), have less accurate mental rotation scores (25.4±6 versus 30.8±5.1) and greater additional distance travelled in the maze task (96.4±66.6 versus 60.4±66.3); all corrected p-values <0.05.

Behavior research methods	https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01432-1	Recent data collected on adult patients with vestibular loss (VL) tend to demonstrate possible cognitive impairments in visuospatial working memory, mental  rotation, selective attention, and space orientation. However, the  neuropsychological profile of children with VL remains largely under-investigated in  the scientific literature. Although previous research has shown that children with  VL may experience some degree of delayed motor development, it is not yet clear if  VL could also lead to specific delayed cognitive development. In this study, we will  present the development and validation of a new tablet-based computerized test  battery (VSAD) that evaluates visuospatial working memory, mental rotation,  selective attention, and space orientation abilities. Thirteen children with VL and  54 average-age matched healthy children performed the VSAD and classical  paper-and-pencil neuropsychological tasks twice within a 1-month interval. Our  results demonstrated a good concurrent validity with strong correlations between the  visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, and space orientation tests of the  VSAD and classical tasks. Test-retest reliability was also supported through good  intra-class coefficients. However, the test of selective attention showed no  concurrent validity with the matched classical task. The discriminant validity of  the VSAD was partially supported for visuospatial working memory and mental rotation  performance accuracy. The VSAD shows good concurrent validity and reliability for  measuring visuospatial working memory, mental rotation, and space orientation in  children with VL. Future studies are needed to extend discriminant validity with  other populations.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

With new era of multimodality therapy, an increasing proportion of patients are now long-term survivors. Procedure: Retrospective review of neuropsychological (NP) status of survivors from the Canadian ATRT registry. Results: Among 77 patients diagnosed between 1995-2012, 16(22%) were survivors. Formal NP assessments were available in eight patients. Partial information on academic achievement was available on three additional patients. There were four girls and seven boys diagnosed at a median age of 27.5 months. Seven patients underwent complete resection and three had metastatic disease. All but one received sequential high dose chemotherapy. Five patients received intrathecal chemotherapy. Three patients underwent radiation. Median age at time of formal NP assessment was 7.6 years (3.9-9.8). Full Scale Intellectual Quotient (FSIQ) ranged from less than 50-119 (mean 78). Simple expressive and receptive language appeared relatively preserved. Three recently diagnosed patients (median time assessment from diagnosis 2.6 years (1.6-4.7)) had average to high average FSIQ, academic and visual spatial skills, visual, and verbal memory. Five other patients diagnosed earlier and tested at a median time of 4.9 years (3.3-8.3) post-diagnosis had a FSIQ ranging from <50 to 71. Approximately 50% of their scores were in the impaired range. Conclusion: Overall this cohort appears significantly impaired at school age despite the absence of systematic radiotherapy. Larger series focusing on neurocognitive outcome are needed in the current context where treatment strategies include adjuvant radiation.

Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2021.02.003	Several papers have investigated the effect of stroke on creativity. While initial evidence favored right hemispheric dominance in artwork creation, subsequent  well-founded research has established the left hemispheric participation in  creativity, supporting the idea of bi-hemispheric role in artistic production. We  here describe the case of a renowned artist who suffered a left hemispheric ischemic  stroke involving the occipito-temporal region and subsequently manifested several  difficulties in producing visual artworks. We documented his recovery phases in a  prospective way during the initial months following stroke and observed that,  although his constructional abilities recovered to a significant extent over 3  months, spontaneous creation was persistently impaired. The right hemispheric role  in visual art is linked mainly to visuo-spatial skills and global attention, while  left hemispheric participation is thought to be related to focal attention and  visual imagery. Our case study lends support to the idea that art is a  bi-hemispheric function with important complementary contributions from both the  right and left hemisphere.

Journal of adolescent health care : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0197-0070(85)80003-6	The association of deficits in spatial abilities and lower Performance IQ (PIQ) scores in Turner's Syndrome Patients (TSPs) has been studied since 1962. Conflicting  results have been reported with regard to the nature of their spatial ability  deficits. This study examines the nature of the cognitive and spatial abilities in  TSPS of normal intelligence. A neuropsychological battery of standardized tests was  administered over a two-month period to 14 TSPs, aged 13-19 years. These patients  had been served medically in the Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, University of  Michigan Medical Center, since childhood. Patient scores were compared to the test  battery's standardized norms by univariate t-tests. No differences were found in the  Wechsler subtest scores previously used to measure spatial abilities (Block Design,  Object Assembly, WISC-R). TSPs excelled in verbal abstract reasoning and verbal  comprehension (p less than 0.01) and demonstrated superior social judgment (p less  than 0.05). Pairwise t-tests did not reveal differences in these spatial measures  when the sample was divided into Bright (110+) and Average (109-80) Verbal IQ (VIQ)  groups. Although their PIQs were within the average range, the TSPs VIQs were  significantly higher (p less than 0.01). Verbal-performance (V-P) differences are  discussed in the context of normal V-P discrepancies in Wechsler's original  standardized sample. Patients did have a significant (p less than 0.01) impairment  on measures that involved the cognitive process of visual memory. Findings suggest  that a specific spatial deficit is not present in TSPs who have average or above  intelligence. Patients in this sample did, however, demonstrate an impairment in  visual memory.

Clinical linguistics & phonetics	https://doi.org/10.1080/02699200701541441	Individuals with the rare genetic disorder, Williams syndrome, have an unusual cognitive profile with relatively good language abilities but poor non-verbal and  spatial skills. This study explored the interaction between linguistic and spatial  functioning in Williams syndrome by investigating individuals' comprehension of  spatial language. A group of 17 individuals with Williams syndrome and a control  group of typically developing children were given two types of picture-matching task  in which they were asked to select a picture to match a spoken sentence describing  the spatial relation between two items. In the first task this matching could be  done on the basis of existing semantic knowledge. In the second, we argue that a  mental representation of the spatial relations was required. Results demonstrated  that individuals with Williams syndrome were selectively impaired on the second task  relative to controls. The study therefore provides support for previous work  demonstrating impaired comprehension of spatial language in this population.  Furthermore, the results suggest that such impairments reflect a fundamental problem  with processing spatial descriptions rather than merely a poor understanding of the  semantics of spatial terms, which in turn has implications for the interaction  between spatial abilities and language processing in general.

It has profound implications for the psychosocial development and academic achievement of affected individuals. Its prevalence is around 10% across nations and is higher in the population with family history of dyslexia. Recent studies have demonstrated that intervention is effective and that prevention of reading failure is possible if preschool children at risk of dyslexia are identified and offered timely and evidence-based training. Objective: To examine the discriminative cognitive measures that might distinguish Chinese preschool children at genetic risk of dyslexia from their typically developing peers; to examine how these abilities correlate with reading in Chinese and with literacy related skills in English. Methods: Eighty younger siblings of children diagnosed with dyslexia were tested on Chinese word recognition, English letter naming, nonverbal IQ and a constellation of cognitive tasks tapping phonological awareness, automaticity, visual-spatial skills and morphological awareness. Controls were typically developing children with no such risk factors and were matched by age, IQ, and parents' education. Results: Compared to controls, at-risk group performed significantly worse in Chinese word recognition and English letter naming. The at-risk group also performed significantly worse in visual-spatial skills, rapid number naming and morphological awareness. Chinese word recognition was found to be significantly correlated with all cognitive measures studied. English letter naming was most strongly correlated with rapid number naming. Conclusion: We demonstrated that early literacy related skills of children with genetic risk of dyslexia were significantly weaker than their typically developing peers. We identified the cognitive measures that discriminated the two groups as early as five-year-old. Further follow-up study on reading performance of our cohorts when they reach their school age will be crucial to validate our present findings and to justify the construction of an assessment tool for early identification of at-risk children.

This leads to a distorted body image that contributes to the development and maintenance of the disorder. The current study aimed to explore a facet of the ALT, namely, the visuo-spatial aspect, and its relation to cognitive flexibility in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). Methods: Fifty-five participants took part in the study: 20 AN patients and 35 controls, matched by age and education. The object perspective taking test (OPTT) and the mental rotation test (MRT), tapping egocentric and allocentric representations, respectively, and a set-shifting task were administered. The brief symptom inventory was used to measure overall levels of distress. Results: AN patients showed higher level of distress. They performed poorer on the OPTT and set-shifting task but not on the MRT. The OPTT and MRT were correlated for controls but not for AN patients, while the set-shifting task and body mass index were associated with the OPTT but not with the MRT for the AN patients. Conclusions: The findings support the ALT by demonstrating impaired visual egocentric representations and intact allocentric visual functions in AN patients, with cognitive flexibility associated only with the egocentric frame. Therefore, egocentric frame impairment in AN patients may be influenced by visual perception and cognitive flexibility deficiency.

The sample included 18 individuals with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of TBRS (11 males, seven females; mean age 17y 7mo, SD 9y 5mo, range 7y 2mo–33y 10mo). The British Ability Scales, Third Edition and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2) were administered to all participants. The Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition and the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, Third Edition were completed by a parent/caregiver. The majority of participants (n=15) had intellectual disability and General Conceptual Ability scores ranged from 39 to 76 (mean 53.17, SD 12.13). Participants displayed a profile of better verbal ability compared with non-verbal reasoning ability and spatial ability. Autistic traits were prevalent and eight participants scored above the cut-off on the ADOS-2, although symptoms were less pronounced in older individuals. Adaptive functioning was impaired but commensurate with intellectual ability. Overall, TBRS is associated with an uneven cognitive profile and a high prevalence of autistic traits. This has implications for identifying appropriate services and support that may be beneficial for individuals with TBRS. What this paper adds: Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome is associated with intellectual disability and impaired adaptive functioning. Autistic traits were prevalent within the sample. Lower intellectual ability and adaptive behaviour were associated with greater severity of autistic traits. © 2019 Mac Keith Press	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

For this purpose, 61 individuals with DS were randomly assigned to three groups: one trained on simultaneous components of visuospatial WM; one serving as an active control group, that completed activities on vocabulary; and one serving as a passive control group, that only attended the pre- and post-test and follow-up assessments. The efficacy of the training was analyzed in terms of specific (spatial-simultaneous WM tasks), near transfer (spatial-sequential and verbal WM tasks), far transfer (spatial abilities, everyday competences), and maintenance effects (with a follow-up at 1 month). The results showed an overall significant effect on the WM on the group receiving the training. The benefit was generally specific, however, with some transfer to other WM tasks, but only in the immediate (post-test) assessment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12010	The current study tested gender differences in the developmental transition from drawing cubes in two- versus three dimensions (3D), and investigated the underlying  spatial abilities. Six- to nine-year-old children (N = 97) drew two occluding model  cubes and solved several other spatial tasks. Girls more often unfolded the various  sides of the cubes into a layout, also called diagrammatic cube drawing (object  design detail). In girls, the best predictor for drawing the cubes was Mental  Rotation Test (MRT) accuracy. In contrast, boys were more likely to preserve the  optical appearance of the cube array. Their drawing in 3D was best predicted by MRT  reaction time and the Embedded Figures Test (EFT). This confirmed boys' stronger  focus on the contours of an object silhouette (object shape). It is discussed  whether the two gender-specific approaches to drawing in three dimensions reflect  two sides of the appearance-reality distinction in drawing, that is graphic syntax  of object design features versus visual perception of projective space.

Learn., ICDL	https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2007.4354043	Already the earliest pictorial depictions show rotated objects, demonstrating evolutionary origins of mental rotation. Unlike children do with their drawing sheets, cave artists could not rotate the wall on which they were painting. This study investigated whether the fixation of the drawing medium, which prevented practical rotation, has an impact on drawing a rotated object. N = 230 children at age five, seven and nine copied an original cave drawing which was adapted to modern time. In a 'natural drawing' condition, paper and model were loose, in a 'fixed' condition, the model could not be moved, and in a third 'completely fixed' condition, neither paper nor model could be moved. 5-year-olds could best draw rotated objects in the 'natural drawing' condition, while 9-year-olds could best draw rotated objects in the highly constrained, 'completely fixed' condition. Children who rotated their sheet of paper in the natural and fixed condition were drawing more rotated objects, independently of age. Additional analysis showed that besides practical rotation also other predictors were significant, i.e. the number of objects in the correct place, their relative size and spatial relation. These results showed that mental rotation is a complex, high-level ability, embedded in a set of spatial skills, which requires considerable information processing capacity, experience and practice, and may have been already present in some early human cultures. Thus, mental rotation would be an ontogenetically late, but phylogenetically ancient skill. © 2007 IEEE.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1
database	Lange, Léonie F.; Heil, Martin; Jansen, Petra	2010	journalArticle	Does children’s left hemisphere lateralization during mental rotation depend upon the stimulus material?	Journal of Individual Differences	https://doi.org/10.1027/1614-0001/a000016	Recent publications suggest that there is a developmental-based change of lateralization of brain activity during mental rotation from left to bilateral. But it is an open question whether this left hemisphere activation could also be observed with stimuli other than characters. To test this, behavioral data and event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured in 28 children, 28 juveniles, and 28 adults during a mental rotation task with animal drawings. The results showed that reaction times (RTs) and error rates decreased with the increasing age of the participants. Furthermore, RTs and error rates increased with increasing angular disparity. An unlateralized ERP amplitude modulation at parietal electrodes as a function of angular disparity was present in all age groups. These results contrast former studies revealing a left lateralization in children when characters were used as stimuli for mental rotation. Left hemisphere activation is therefore not a general developmental trend; rather, it is suggested that it might be a correlate of written language acquisition.

Methods: A literature search was conducted up to November 14, 2017 in Scopus and in several databases on EBSCOhost platform. Citations were obtained, articles related to retained citations were reviewed and a final list of included studies was identified. Methods in the field of technical skills relating an intervention to spatial abilities test scores between intervention groups or obtained before and after the intervention were identified as eligible. The quality of included studies was assessed and data were extracted in a systematic way. Results: A series of 5513 citations was obtained. Ninety-nine articles were retained and fully reviewed, yielding four included studies. No difference in the Hidden Figure Test score after one year was observed after residency training in General Surgery of at least nine months. A first-year dental curriculum was not found to elevate the Novel Object Cross-Sections Test score (P = 0.07). A two-semester learning period of abdominal sonography was found to increase the Revised Minnesota Paper Form Board Test score (P < 0.05). A hands-on radiology course using interactive three-dimensional image post-processing software consisting of seven two-hour long seminars on a weekly basis was found to amplify the Cube Perspective Test score (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Spatial abilities tests scores were enhanced by courses in abdominal sonography and hands-on radiology, but were not improved by residency training in General Surgery and first-year dental curriculum. © 2020 The Authors	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

The abuse of inhalants is recognized as posing an enormous morbidity and mortality risk in adolescents throughout the world. Among other damages, there is evidence that the chronic use of inhalants produces neuro-psychological alterations. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV), the "examination of the individual who chronically uses inhalants may reveal a number of neurological deficits, including generalized weakness and peripheral neuropathies. Cerebral atrophy, cerebellar degeneration and white matter lesions resulting in cranial nerve or pyramidal tract signs have been reported among individuals with heavy use" (DSM IV, p. 141). Sharp et al. (1992) report that although most solvents produce non-specific effects derived from extremely high concentrations, some produce fairly specific neurological syndromes that are either peripheral or linked to the central nervous system with low levels of chronic exposure that include peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy (in Medina Mora, 2001). Tapert and Brown (1999) and Van Gorp et al. (1999) claim that studies of young inhalant abusers provide the strongest evidence for cognitive deficits related to substance use. Verbal abilities appear intact, but tasks of attention, declarative memory, fine motor, psychomotor speed and visual and spatial skills are impaired relative to demographically matched controls. Similar findings regarding memory and concentration impairment, as well as attention problems, disorientation and motor and perceptual difficulties have been reported by Castro et al. (1985) and Ortiz et al. (1985). Ortiz et al. (1992) also report euphoria, seizures, optic neuropathy, cerebellum ataxia, and probable dementia in toluene users. The aim of this paper is to present the results of the application of the Mexican standardization of Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) to evaluate the viso-constructive skill of a group of adolescents that use inhalants as their drug of preference, in order to assess their neuro-psychological status and the sensitivity of the instrument in screening tests, with a view to its implementation in intervention programs. The subjects were contacted through a combined convenience and snowball procedure. The sample comprised ten males and four females (F1), contacted at schools, and eight women in treatment centers and community work with a lower social status (F2). The selection criteria for substance use was defined as nonexperimental use of solvents for at least six months prior to the study, at least twice a week, without taking into account the use of any other substances. Other criteria for inclusion included attending school or not having left school for over six months prior to the study and living with the family. The RCFT was applied individually after an interview. The figures were applied, rated, and interpreted according to Mexican psychometric and qualitative standards, drawn up by Galindo and collaborators (Galindo et al., 1996; Cortés et al. 1996; Salvador et al., 1996). The RCFT has been widely studied by this group in the Mexican population. Results showed that the inhalants consumed were thinner, cement, PVC and toluene; 23% of the interviewees did so every day and the remainder at least twice a week. Other substances consumed by them include marijuana, alcohol, cocaine and medical drugs. The comparisons, using T tests, of the means of the subjects with the normative parameters of the Mexican population of the RCFT showed significantly lower scores among the former, in total data, as well as in separate copy and memory scores. A comparison of the two groups of females, using the Mann-Whitney U test, showed that the group with the greatest deficiencies (F2) obtained significantly lower scores than Group F1 in the total scores, as well as in copy and memory production. A comparison between the groups of males failed to reveal any significant differences between men and women in Group F1, although significant differences were observed between the males and females in Group F2 in copy production and total scores. The analysis of the qualitative characteristics of the RCFT, which estimates the number of cases with scores over the 90 percentile, showed a significant deviation among inhalants in comparison with the normative population. In copy production, the entire sample of users drew uncoordinated lines. Over half the sample drew a particular perceptual unit in the wrong place, while just under half rotated 45°a perceptual unit, failed to complete a unit or omitted it and displayed problems of tangency. In memory production, 20 of the 22 users drew uncoordinated lines, while nearly half rotated 45°a perceptual unit, drew a particular unit in the wrong place within the context or displayed errors of angling. Finally, four representative cases of the highest and lowest scores on the RCFT are presented, showing how the amount of use does not seem to be related to performance on the test, although certain living conditions probably are. It can be concluded that, as a group, among these young inhalants, the viso-constructive skill is affected and secondly, subjects that develop within a more favorable environment appear to have a better chance of neuro-psychological development, meaning that they are more resistant to the damage caused by the use or abuse of toxic substances. At the same time, the qualitative analysis of the RCFT showed that the most significant deficits occurred in fine motor coordination and the perceptual integration of the figure, in both visual and spatial terms.

This study was based on the hypothesis that music perception and phonological awareness appear to have parallel auditory perceptual mechanisms. Previous research investigating the relationship between these constructs—music perception and phonological awareness—has been promising, but inconclusive. Phonological awareness is an important component of early literacy which many children struggle to acquire. If the constructs are shown to be related, music-based interventions may then be developed to promote phonological awareness, thus enhancing early literacy.      Music perception, phonological awareness, and visual-spatial skills of 119 five- and six-year-old children were tested. The researcher administered the Children's Music Aptitude Test (Stevens, 1987) in order to assess perception of pitch, rhythm, and melody. Subsequently, the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (Wagner, Torgesen, & Rashotte, 1999) was administered in order to measure phonological awareness skills, including blending, elision, and sound matching. The Visual Spatial Relations subtest of the Woodcock Johnson III (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2001) was later used to assess visual spatial skills.      Structural equation modeling (SEM) allowed the researcher to model relationships between the latent variables to investigate the contribution of music perception, visual-spatial skills, and age to phonological awareness. Results supported the hypothesis that music perception, visual spatial skills, and age predict phonological awareness.      Additionally, music perception made a statistically significant contribution to phonological awareness, when controlling for visual spatial skills and age. Specifically, music perception predicted a larger amount of standardized unit change in phonological awareness than did the other predictors in the theory. Thus, music perception appears to have a stronger relationship with phonological awareness than age or visual spatial skills.     Further, results showed that a model without music perception as a predictor of phonological awareness was not supported. These findings confirm that music perception plays a unique role in predicting phonological awareness, above and beyond the contribution made by visual spatial skills and age. This study's results could be used in support of the development of music-based interventions for promoting phonological awareness in five- and six-year-old children.

In the present research, we assessed math and spatial anxiety in 394 elementary schoolchildren (ages 6 to 12 years) and investigated their relations to math achievement and spatial reasoning performance, respectively. In addition, we evaluated children's verbal anxiety and reading ability to determine the domain specificity of relations between anxiety and cognitive performance during childhood. At the zero-order level, math, spatial, and verbal anxiety were moderately correlated with one another and with children's performance in the corresponding cognitive domains. Importantly, however, all three forms of anxiety displayed some domain specificity in their relations to cognitive performance. Gender differences in math and spatial anxiety were also domain-specific, with girls reporting significantly greater math and spatial anxiety, but not verbal anxiety, across the age range tested. These results demonstrate that math and spatial anxiety represent unique constructs early in development, exhibiting specificity in their associations with gender and cognitive performance during the first years of formal schooling. © 2018 American Psychological Association.

This ability is often studied with mental rotation tasks thought to elicit mental processes analogous to physical rotation and to produce a robust male advantage in performance. Paradoxically, 4-year-olds display limited mental rotation skills when tested explicitly, yet infants perform above chance on implicit mental rotation tasks. Moreover, 4-year-old girls and boys perform similarly on explicit mental rotation tasks, whereas some studies have reported a male advantage in infants’ implicit performance. Thus, it is unclear whether implicit and explicit mental rotation tasks elicit similar processes, whether such processes display developmental continuity between infancy and adulthood, and if so, when gender differences first emerge in ontogeny. The present dissertation addressed these questions through three studies. First, a novel pupillometry task was designed to compare the implicit mental rotation performance of adults (Study 1) and 4-year-olds (Study 2). In both age groups, participants’ pupillary responses were consistent with analog mental rotation and were correlated with explicit mental rotation performance. Gender differences in pupillary responses were present at both time points, yet a male advantage in explicit performance was only found in adults. Study 3 further characterized the development of analog mental rotation by examining infants’ performance on an implicit change-detection task. Infants’ visual preferences were consistent with analog processes, but did not vary by gender. Together, these results suggest that analog mental rotation processes, as assessed via implicit mental rotation tasks, exhibit moderate developmental continuity between early childhood and adulthood, but gender differences in performance may undergo notable change across this period of development.

Psychological science	https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797616655977	Despite considerable interest in the role of spatial intelligence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) achievement, little is known about  the ontogenetic origins of individual differences in spatial aptitude or their  relation to later accomplishments in STEM disciplines. The current study provides  evidence that spatial processes present in infancy predict interindividual variation  in both spatial and mathematical competence later in development. Using a  longitudinal design, we found that children's performance on a brief visuospatial  change-detection task administered between 6 and 13 months of age was related to  their spatial aptitude (i.e., mental-transformation skill) and mastery of  symbolic-math concepts at 4 years of age, even when we controlled for general  cognitive abilities and spatial memory. These results suggest that nascent spatial  processes present in the first year of life not only act as precursors to later  spatial intelligence but also predict math achievement during childhood.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00558	Accumulating evidence suggests that males outperform females on mental rotation tasks as early as infancy. Sex differences in object preference have also been shown  to emerge early in development and precede sex-typed play in childhood. Although  research with adults and older children is suggestive of a relationship between play  preferences and visuospatial abilities, including mental rotation, little is known  about the developmental origins of this relationship. The present study compared  mental rotation ability and object preference in 6- to 13-month-old infants. We used  a novel paradigm to examine individual differences in infants' mental rotation  abilities as well as their differential preference for one of two sex-typed objects.  A sex difference was found on both tasks, with boys showing an advantage in  performance on the mental rotation task and exhibiting greater visual attention to  the male-typed object (i.e., a toy truck) than to the female-typed object (i.e., a  doll) in comparison to girls. Moreover, we found a relation between mental rotation  and object preference that varied by sex. Greater visual interest in the male-typed  object was related to greater mental rotation performance in boys, but not in girls.  Possible explanations related to perceptual biases, prenatal androgen exposure, and  experiential influences for this sex difference are discussed.

Although the male advantage in mental rotation performance represents one of the most robust gender differences in adult cognition, the developmental trajectory of this male advantage remains a topic of considerable debate. To address this debate, we meta-analyzed 303 effect sizes pertaining to gender differences in mental rotation performance among 30,613 children and adolescents. We found significant developmental change in the magnitude of the gender difference: A small male advantage in mental rotation performance first emerged during childhood and then subsequently increased with age, reaching a moderate effect size during adolescence. Procedural factors, including task and stimulus characteristics, also accounted for variability in reported gender differences, even when controlling for the effect of age. These results demonstrate that both age and procedural characteristics moderate the magnitude of the gender difference in mental rotation throughout development.

In particular the ability to reach to objects using visual feedback requires overcoming several issues related to coordination, spatial transformations, redundancy, and complex learning spaces. This paper describes a model of longitudinal development that covers the full sequence from blind motor babbling to successful grasping of seen objects. This includes the learning of saccade control, gaze control, torso control, and visually-elicited reaching and grasping in 3-D space. This paper builds on and extends our prior investigations into the development of gaze control, eye-hand coordination, the use of constraints to shape learning, and a schema memory system for the learning of sensorimotor experience. New contributions include our application of the LWPR algorithm to learn how movements of the torso affect the robot's representation of space, and the first use of the schema framework to enable grasping and interaction with objects. The results from our integration of these various components into an implementation of longitudinal development on an iCub robot show their ability to generate infant-like development, from a start point with zero coordination up to skilled spatial reaching in less than three hours. © 2014 IEEE.

This study aimed to examine whether visuo-spatial abilities (i.e. attention, short-term memory, and relations) contribute significantly to predicting word and pseudo-word reading independently of phonological awareness in Arabic speaking children in grades 4 and 5. An inter-groups comparison between two groups of readers comprising typical readers (n = 44) and children with dyslexia (n = 32). All participants were tested in phonological (phonological awareness) and visuo-spatial measures (visual short-term memory test, visuo-spatial attention, and visuo-spatial relations). Results showed that typical readers outperformed the group of dyslexics in all the phonological and visuo-spatial measures. Visuo-spatial abilities were also a contributing factor in predicting word reading after controlling for phonological awareness, age, and non-verbal reasoning. Findings indicate that vowelised word reading in Arabic is heavily underpinned by phonological awareness and visuo-spatial abilities, found to be impaired in a group with dyslexia. Findings are viewed in the frame that reveals the integrated roles of phonological awareness and visual and spatial abilities in reading development. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Results showed that readers with dyslexia (n = 32) performed significantly lower and were slower than typical readers (n = 44) in the three MR tasks. Furthermore, ‘group’ and ‘type of stimuli’ effects were obtained for accuracy and speed of MR implementation, indicating impaired visual spatial orientation processing in children with dyslexia. Furthermore, repeated measures of ANOVA showed that letter MR is significantly slower than pictures and symbols in dyslexic group but no difference in terms of accuracy.

Since both abilities require the efficient use of visual imagery, it was hypothesized that they would be positively correlated. Further, artistic ability was hypothesized to be more strongly related to two-dimensional spatial skills than to three-dimensional.    Forty-one fourth- and fifth-grade elementary students participated. Clark's Drawing Abilities Test was used to measure artistic ability and the Johnson-Meade Spatial Battery was used to measure spatial proficiency. Correlation coefficients was used as statistical methods. The children's drawing and spatial ability were positively correlated (r =.308: p =.049). Drawing ability was more strongly correlated with two-dimensional spatial ability (r =.345: p =.027) than with three-dimensional (r =.230: p =.147). So this study is supported by these results. That is, children's artistic ability is related to spatial proficiency, especially in two-dimensional spatial ability.    The results of this study are in agreement with a growing body of literature that supports the role of art education at the elementary school level as a contributor to cognitive, as well as aesthetic, ability.

As a result, the study of spatial cognition and its neural correlates has been a fruitful area of research that has benefited immensely from making cross-species generalizations. Converging evidence from all areas of cognitive science – from the firing of single neurons in the rodent brain, to the development of spatial abilities in chicks, fish, and children, to visual scene perception in adult humans – reveals that environmental boundaries, such as walls, ledges, cliffs, hills, and other terrain-like structures, play a fundamental role in vertebrate spatial mapping and navigation behavior. The aim of this review is to bring together three decades of research in the first comprehensive boundary-based view of spatial cognition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

IDC - Int. Conf. Interact. Des. Child.	https://doi.org/10.1145/2930674.2930715	Spatial ability is one of mental ability which grounds children's educational development critically, and is used in whole dimensions of our life in conjunction with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) learning. In this paper, we present a gamification tool socalled "Hide and Seek" which nourishes spatial ability. A child seeks a place where a tagger is hidden by comparing Lego village and the corresponding picture taken by the tagger. A concept of this game is comparing the 2-dimensional flat surface of the picture and 3-dimensional Lego village. We conducted user tests of Hide and Seek with children. The aims of user test are observing usability, usage of spatial language and game elements while children are playing the game. From the test, we observed spatial cognition factor and dialogues used during problem solving and usability. Based on the results, we also derived additional concept refinements of the presented educational game system. © 2016 ACM.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	2	2	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00641	Individuals who do well in mathematics and science also often have good spatial skills. However, the predictive direction of links between spatial abilities and  mathematical learning has not been firmly established, especially for young  children. In the present research, we addressed this issue using a sample from a  longitudinal data set that spanned 4 years and which includes measures of  mathematical performance and various cognitive skills, including spatial ability.  Children were tested once in each of 4 years (Time 1, 2, 3, and 4). At Time 3 and 4,  101 children (in Grades 2, 3, or 4 at Time 3) completed mathematical measures  including (a) a number line task (0-1000), (b) arithmetic, and (c) number system  knowledge. Measures of spatial ability were collected at Time 1, 2, or 3. As  expected, spatial ability was correlated with all of the mathematical measures at  Time 3 and 4, and predicted growth in number line performance from Time 3 to Time 4.  However, spatial ability did not predict growth in either arithmetic or in number  system knowledge. Path analyses were used to test whether number line performance at  Time 3 was predictive of arithmetic and number system knowledge at Time 4 or whether  the reverse patterns were dominant. Contrary to the prediction that the number line  is an important causal construct that facilitates learning arithmetic, no evidence  was found that number line performance predicted growth in calculation more than  calculation predicted number line growth. However, number system knowledge at Time 3  was predictive of number line performance at Time 4, independently of spatial  ability. These results provide useful information about which aspects of growth in  mathematical performance are (and are not) related to spatial ability and clarify  the relations between number line performance and measures of arithmetic and number  system knowledge.

In the present study, we analyzed the behavioral effects of environmental complexity on different facets of spatial function, and we assessed dendritic arborisation and spine density in a cortical area mainly involved in the spatial learning, as the parietal cortex. Wistar rat pups (21 days old) were housed in enriched conditions (10 animals in a large cage with toys and a running wheel), or standard condition (two animals in a standard cage, without objects). At the age of 3 months, both groups were tested in the radial maze task and Morris water maze (MWM). Morphological analyses on layer-III pyramidal neurons of parietal cortex were performed in selected animals belonging to both experimental groups. In the radial maze task, enriched animals exhibited high performance levels, by exploiting procedural competencies and working memory abilities. Furthermore, when the requirements of the context changed, they promptly reorganized their strategies by shifting from prevalently using spatial procedures to applying mnesic competencies. In the Morris water maze, enriched animals more quickly acquired tuned navigational strategies. Environmental enrichment provoked increased dendritic arborisation as well as increased density of dendritic spines in layer-III parietal pyramidal neurons. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Both abilities develop during preschool age. We investigated 83 children aged between 3 and 4 years regarding their theory of mind and mental rotation ability. A significant correlation between both tasks was found for those children, who were able to solve the mental rotation task. This relation was no longer significant when analyzing the two age groups separately. Due to the small sample size as well as the performance in the mental rotation test more research is needed to investigate this relationship and its role in development. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, a correlation between motor tests, paper-pencil and chronometric mental rotation tests, and working memory tests were conducted in 3- to 6-year-old children. A stepwise multiple-regression showed that 55.5% of the variance was explained by the working memory tests: digit span forward and Corsi forward. This indicates that working memory and executive functions may play an important role in mental rotation and motor processes. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

The first test was the radial arm maze (RAM), a navigational test frequently used in animal models. The second test was a subtest from the Kaufman assessment battery for children (K-ABC). The IUGR group comprised 28 children aged 6 years. The control group comprised 29 appropriate-for-gestational age children. The performance of the IUGR children was significantly inferior to controls in both tests. In the RAM test, the ratio between the correct entrances to the total entrances was significantly lower in the IUGR group than in the control group (P < 0.001). In the K-ABC, the IUGR group could not perform as well as control children (P < 0.001). These results suggest that spatial orientation in IUGR children is inferior to their age-matched controls, possibly contributing to their potential learning difficulties. The present results also suggest that the RAM can be potentially used to test spatial orientation of children at-risk. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Journal of child neurology	https://doi.org/10.1177/0883073807299859	Multidomain assessment may enhance the diagnosis of cognitive impairment in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A set of novel Web-enabled  computerized tests has recently been shown to be valid for identifying mild  cognitive impairment and characterizing the cognitive profile associated with  various disorders. It was anticipated that these tests would be well suited for use  in children with ADHD. The authors tested this idea in a pilot study of 15 children  (12 males, 3 females; mean age, 11 years 10 months; range, 9-15 years) with ADHD and  15 age-, education-, and gender-matched controls. The profile of cognitive  impairment in ADHD children off methylphenidate across 6 cognitive domains (memory,  executive function, visual-spatial skills, verbal function, attention, and motor  skills) was described relative to controls. The effect of treatment with  methylphenidate was examined by comparing the ADHD children on methylphenidate and  on placebo (administered in a double-blind randomized fashion) relative to controls  and by comparing the ADHD children on methylphenidate relative to placebo.  Significant impairment in ADHD was evident in memory, visual-spatial, verbal, and  attention domains, and near-significant impairment was observed in executive  function and motor skills. On methylphenidate but not placebo, performance was  comparable to controls in immediate verbal memory, psychomotor accuracy,  visual-spatial, verbal rhyming, and overall battery performance. Significant  improvement with administration of methylphenidate relative to placebo was evident  for psychomotor accuracy, verbal rhyming, and overall battery performance. Hence, on  the limited basis of this pilot study, the set of computerized tests studied appears  to be useful for measuring cognitive function in ADHD; however, additional studies  are needed to confirm this.

Adult recognition systems are able to recognize objects which are presented in unexpected or unconventional positions and some authors have suggested that the underlying processes involved in accomplishing this are similar to those which are tapped in abstract mental rotation tasks conducted in the psychology lab. This paper attempts to address the developmental aspect of the problem by looking at whether mental rotation skills have become established at a time when recognition of objects placed at unconventional angles has been attained. The results showed that scores in mental rotation and in rotated object recognition are not correlated in young children or in the elderly. As a consequence, it appears that mental rotation skills are not yet fully developed and have begun to deteriorate at an age when rotated object recognition is preserved.

Visuospatial short term memory was assessed through transformational imagery tasks. The first set of experiments (chapters 3, 4 and 5) concerned the development of mental rotation abilities. A review of the literature suggested that young children (specifically so-called preoperational children) and elderly people are poor at rotating a mental image of a visual pattern. However, as some mental rotation abilities have been reported while using Shepard's paradigm, attention was focussed on the role of the first steps necessarily taken while performing a mental rotation task, specifically the maintenance of a visual pattern in STM. The second set of experiments (chapter 6) considered another imagery subsystem, namely "mental scanning". Like mental rotation, it requires the maintenance of a visual pattern in short term memory. Image maintenance ability has been assessed in reference to Kosslyn's (1994) model although Baddeley's (1986) working memory model- specifically, Logie's (1995) revision of the VSSP - has been sometimes considered while interpreting the data. These two different theoretical models suggest the existence of two related but different subsystems for sorting visual and spatial information. Most of the data presented in this thesis suggest that young children and the elderly have some difficulties maintaining spatial characteristics of a visual pattern in short term memory, i.e. the orientation of the stimulus in the mental rotation tasks and the location of targets in the mental scanning tasks. These results tend to provide some developmental evidence for a dissociation between the dorsal and ventral subsystems. It seems that the two subsystems develop at different speeds. The ventral subsystem might be better developed earlier than the dorsal subsystem. Similarly, some data suggest that the same ventral system is not yet affected by ageing when the dorsal subsystem has already begun to deteriorate.

The education of blind children poses issues as many scholar disciplines (e.g., geometry, mathematics) are normally taught by heavily relying on vision. Touch-based assistive technologies are potential tools to provide graphical contents to blind users, improving learning possibilities and social inclusion. Raised-lines drawings are still the golden standard, but stimuli cannot be reconfigured or adapted and the blind person constantly requires assistance. Although much research concerns technological development, little work concerned the assessment of programmable tactile graphics, in educative and rehabilitative contexts. Here we designed, on programmable tactile displays, tests aimed at assessing spatial memory skills and shapes recognition abilities. Tests involved a group of blind and a group of low vision children and adolescents in a four-week longitudinal schedule. After establishing subject-specific difficulty levels, we observed a significant enhancement of performance across sessions and for both groups. Learning effects were comparable to raised paper control tests: however, our setup required minimal external assistance. Overall, our results demonstrate that programmable maps are an effective way to display graphical contents in educative/rehabilitative contexts. They can be at least as effective as traditional paper tests yet providing superior flexibility and versatility. © 2016 IEEE.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This important skill suffers from biases that may be more pronounced when estimation is based on haptics. This is especially true for the blind and visually impaired, for which haptic estimation of distances is paramount but not systematically trained. We investigated whether a programmable tactile display, used autonomously, can improve distance discrimination ability in blind and severely visually impaired youngsters between 7 and 22 years-old. Methods: Training consisted of four weekly sessions in which participants were asked to haptically find, on the programmable tactile display, the pairs of squares which were separated by the shortest and longest distance in tactile images with multiple squares. A battery of haptic tests with raised-line drawings was administered before and after training, and scores were compared to those of a control group that did only the haptic battery, without doing the distance discrimination training on the tactile display. Results: Both blind and severely impaired youngsters became more accurate and faster at the task during training. In haptic battery results, blind and severely impaired youngsters who used the programmable display improved in three and two tests, respectively. In contrast, in the control groups, the blind control group improved in only one test, and the severely visually impaired in no tests. Conclusions: Distance discrimination skills can be trained equally well in both blind and severely impaired participants. More importantly, autonomous training with the programmable tactile display had generalized effects beyond the trained task. Participants improved not only in the size discrimination test but also in memory span tests. Our study shows that tactile stimulation training that requires minimal human assistance can effectively improve generic spatial skills. © 2019 The Author(s).

During postnatal development, the medial temporal lobe completes its maturation, and children acquire new memory abilities. In recent years, virtual reality-based tasks have been introduced in the neuropsychology field to assess different cognitive functions. In this work, desktop virtual reality tasks are combined with classic psychometric tests to assess spatial abilities in 4- to 10-year-old children. Method: Fifty boys and 50 girls 4-10-years of age participated in this study. Spatial reference memory and spatial working memory were assessed using a desktop virtual reality-based task. Other classic psychometric tests were also included in this work (e.g., the Corsi Block Tapping Test, digit tests, 10/36 Spatial Recall Test). Results: In general terms, 4- and 5-year-old groups showed poorer performance than the older groups. However, 5-year-old children showed basic spatial navigation abilities with little difficulty. In addition, boys outperformed girls from the 6-8-year-old groups. Gender differences only emerged in the reference-memory version of the spatial task, whereas both sexes displayed similar performances in the working-memory version. Conclusion: There was general improvement in the performance of different tasks in children older than 5 years. However, results also suggest that brain regions involved in allocentric memory are functional even at the age of 5. In addition, the brain structures underlying reference memory mature later in girls than those required for the working memory. © 2014 American Psychological Association.

European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-010-0169-z	Early-onset bipolar disorder is an impairing condition that is strongly associated with genetic inheritance. Neurocognitive deficits are core traits of this disorder  which seem to be present in both young and adult forms. Deficits in verbal memory  and attention are persistent within euthymic phases in bipolar adults, adolescents,  and children. In younger samples, including type I or II and not otherwise specified  patients, executive functions are not widely impaired and the existence of  visual-spatial deficits remains unclear. The main aim of this study was to compare  the neurocognitive performance in young stabilized type I or II bipolar patients and  healthy controls. Fifteen medicated adolescents with bipolar disorder and 15 healthy  adolescents, matched in age and gender, were compared on visual-spatial skills  (reasoning, memory, visual-motor accuracy) and executive functioning (attention and  working memory, set-shifting, inhibition) using t-tests and MANCOVA. Correcting for  verbal competence, MANCOVA showed that patients performed significantly worse than  controls in letters and numbers sequencing (P = 0.003), copy (P < 0.001) and  immediate recall (P = 0.007) of the Rey Complex Figure Test, interference of the  Stroop Color-Word Test (P = 0.007) and non-perseverative errors on the Wisconsin  Card Sorting Test (P = 0.038). Impaired cognitive performance was found in young  bipolar patients in working memory, visual-motor skills, and inhibitory control.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The focus-execute component of attention is the ability to identify salient features, and perform rapid responses under conditions of distractions (Lyon, 1994). Findings suggested that children with TS performed significantly less well on the following measures of the focus-execute component of attention: Stroop Color and Word Test (Golden, 1978) and the Trail Making Test B (Reitan & Wolfson, 1985). No differences between the groups were found on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (Smith, 1982) and Concentration Endurance Test (Brickenkamp, 1981). The pattern of performance on the focus-execute attention measures of young and old children with TS did not differ from that of young and old healthy comparison children. In general, children with TS performed within the normative range on low but not high task demands. Karyotype of children with TS was not related to the level of performance on the focus-execute attention measures. In examining unique contributions of several potentially confounding variables (e.g., visual-spatial, motor, impulse control, and working memory) to the focus-execute attention measures, visual-spatial skills and working memory were found to account for variance in the performance on the Stroop Color condition only, indicating that the focus-execute measures used in the study were relatively not confounded. Results are discussed in the context of an integrated model of attention proposed by the present author to explain the nature of the focus-execute component of attention in children with TS. The need for establishing ecological validity of the focus-execute attention measures to assist in planning psychoeducational interventions for children with TS is suggested.

The size of this advantage was no more robust for  rotation items than for translation items. This finding contrasts with studies of  older children and adults, which report that sex differences are largest on mental  rotation tasks. Comparable performance of boys and girls on a vocabulary task  indicated that the male advantage on the spatial task was not attributable to an  overall intellectual advantage of boys in the sample.

In a longitudinal study, children were administered two spatial tasks requiring mental transformations and a syntax comprehension task in the fall and spring of second and third grades. Boys from middle-and high-SES backgrounds outperformed their female counterparts on both spatial tasks, whereas boys and girls from a low-SES group did not differ in their performance level on these tasks. As expected, no sex differences were found on the verbal comprehension task. Prior studies have generally been based on the assumption that the male spatial advantage reflects ability differences in the population as a whole. Our finding that the advantage is sensitive to variations in SES provides a challenge to this assumption, and has implications for a successful explanation of the sex-related difference in spatial skill.

Cognitive science	https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12603	We examined the effects of three different training conditions, all of which involve the motor system, on kindergarteners' mental transformation skill. We focused on  three main questions. First, we asked whether training that involves making a motor  movement that is relevant to the mental transformation-either concretely through  action (action training) or more abstractly through gestural movements that  represent the action (move-gesture training)-resulted in greater gains than training  using motor movements irrelevant to the mental transformation (point-gesture  training). We tested children prior to training, immediately after training  (posttest), and 1 week after training (retest), and we found greater improvement in  mental transformation skill in both the action and move-gesture training conditions  than in the point-gesture condition, at both posttest and retest. Second, we asked  whether the total gain made by retest differed depending on the abstractness of the  movement-relevant training (action vs. move-gesture), and we found that it did not.  Finally, we asked whether the time course of improvement differed for the two  movement-relevant conditions, and we found that it did-gains in the action condition  were realized immediately at posttest, with no further gains at retest; gains in the  move-gesture condition were realized throughout, with comparable gains from  pretest-to-posttest and from posttest-to-retest. Training that involves movement,  whether concrete or abstract, can thus benefit children's mental transformation  skill. However, the benefits unfold differently over time-the benefits of concrete  training unfold immediately after training (online learning); the benefits of more  abstract training unfold in equal steps immediately after training (online learning)  and during the intervening week with no additional training (offline learning).  These findings have implications for the kinds of instruction that can best support  spatial learning.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The authors developed a spatial transformation task, which showed a substantial male advantage by age 4 years 6 months. The size of this advantage was no more robust for rotation items than for translation items. This finding contrasts with studies of older children and adults, which report that sex differences are largest on mental rotation tasks. Comparable performance of boys and girls on a vocabulary task indicated that the male advantage on the spatial task was not attributable to an overall intellectual advantage of boys in the sample.

However, little is known about the early experiences that may contribute to these differences. The current study examined the relation between children's early puzzle play and their spatial skill. Children and parents (n = 53) were observed at home for 90 min every 4 months (6 times) between 2 and 4 years of age (26 to 46 months). When children were 4 years 6 months old, they completed a spatial task involving mental transformations of 2-dimensional shapes. Children who were observed playing with puzzles performed better on this task than those who did not, controlling for parent education, income, and overall parent word types. Moreover, among those children who played with puzzles, frequency of puzzle play predicted performance on the spatial transformation task. Although the frequency of puzzle play did not differ for boys and girls, the quality of puzzle play (a composite of puzzle difficulty, parent engagement, and parent spatial language) was higher for boys than for girls. In addition, variation in puzzle play quality predicted performance on the spatial transformation task for girls but not for boys. Implications of these findings as well as future directions for research on the role of puzzle play in the development of spatial skill are discussed.

Infants (N = 90) in three age groups (6, S 1/2 and 12 months) experienced three conditions: topological, geometric, and control. A round room contained four distinctive objects in a rectangular arrangement on the inside periphery. Infants were familiarized to the array prior to a 2-min test period. In the topological condition, two objects were switched. In the geometric condition, the objects were moved to form an irregular quadrilateral. In the control condition, the array remained unchanged. Infants of S 1/2, months and over visually explored significantly more in the geometric condition only. An initial study with adults found greater visual exploration in both geometric and topological conditions. These results are discussed in the context of current theories of spatial orientation. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	SK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	uploaded to include folder	ASK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		7	5	0	5	5	1	0	0

American journal of medical genetics. Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics	https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.b.30379	22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) is the most common genetic microdeletion syndrome affecting humans. The syndrome is associated with general cognitive  impairments and specific deficits in visual-spatial ability, non-verbal reasoning,  and planning skills. 22q11DS is also associated with behavioral and psychiatric  abnormalities, including a markedly elevated risk for schizophrenia. Research  findings indicate that people with schizophrenia, as well as those identified as  schizoptypic, show specific cognitive deficits in the areas of sustained attention,  executive functioning, and verbal working memory. The present study examined such  schizophrenic-like cognitive deficits in children and adolescents with 22q11DS (n =  26) and controls (n = 25) using a cross-sectional design. As hypothesized, 22q11DS  participants exhibited deficits in intelligence, achievement, sustained attention,  executive functioning, and verbal working memory compared to controls. Furthermore,  deficits in attention and executive functioning were more pronounced in the 22q11DS  sample relative to general cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that the  same pattern of neuropsychological impairment seen in patients with schizophrenia is  present in non-psychotic children identified as at-risk for the development of  schizophrenia based on a known genetic risk marker.

Contemporary educational psychology	https://doi.org/10.1006/ceps.1999.1029	This study investigated the effectiveness of instruction on spatial skills. It examined the effect of instruction of liquid horizontality on the performance on  Piagetian Water Level Task (WLT) from a developmental perspective through two  substudies. In Study 1, the WLT was administered to 256 boys and 230 girls of ages  9, 10, 12, 14, and 17 from Beijing, China, before and after instruction. The results  indicate that the instruction effect was significant for the 6th (p <.05) and 8th  graders (p <.001) but not for the 4th, 5th, and 11th graders. Study 2 examined  instruction effect in contrast with practice effect. Participants were 69 boys and  52 girls of ages 9-14 from Beijing, China. The results indicate that children  improve more on the WLT with the combination of instruction and practice than with  practice alone (p <.01). The findings depict a relationship between cognitive  development and instruction effect on the WLT. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Since the false discovery rate (FDR) criterion was introduced to the neuroimaging community a decade ago, many variations have been proposed, mainly to enhance detection power. However, a fundamental geometrical property known as transformation invariance has not been adequately addressed, especially for the voxel-wise FDR. Correction of multiple testing applied after spatial transformation is not necessarily equivalent to transformation applied after correction in the original space. Without the invariance property, assigning different testing spaces will yield different results. We find that normalized residuals of linear models with Gaussian noises are uniformly distributed on a unit high-dimensional sphere, independent of t-statistics and F-statistics. By defining volumetric measure in the hyper-spherical space mapped by normalized residuals, instead of the image's Euclidean space, we can achieve invariant control of the FDR under diffeomorphic transformation. This hyper-spherical measure also reflects intrinsic 'volume of randomness' in signals. Experiments with synthetic, semi-synthetic and real images demonstrate that our method significantly reduces FDR inconsistency introduced by the choice of testing spaces. © 1982-2012 IEEE.

Given the sensitivity of the developing brain to environmental factors, this study examined whether early-life weight status was associated with children's cognition. Methods: Using data from mother–child pairs enrolled in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (2003–2006), children's early-life weight status was assessed using weight-for-length/height standard deviation (SD) scores. A battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to assess cognition, executive function, and visual-spatial abilities at ages 5 and 8 years. Using linear mixed models, associations between early-life weight status and cognition were estimated. Results: Among 233 children, 167 were lean (≤1 SD) and 48 were nonlean (>1 SD). After covariate adjustment, the results suggest that full-scale intelligence quotient scores decreased with a 1-unit increase in weight-for-height SD score (β = –1.4, 95% CI: –3.0 to 0.1). For individual component scores, with a 1-unit increase in weight-for-height SD score, perceptual reasoning (β = –1.7, 95% CI: –3.3 to 0.0) and working memory (β: –2.4, CI: –4.4 to –0.4) scores decreased. Weight status was generally not associated with other cognition measures. Conclusions: Within this cohort of typically developing children, early-life weight status was inversely associated with children's perceptual reasoning and working memory scores and possibly with full-scale intelligent quotient scores. © 2018 The Obesity Society	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, many studies report a male advantage in spatial task performance which has been attributed to biological factors as well as environmental factors, such as play experience that is spatial. In the present study, we examine how parents of preschool-aged children interact with daughters versus sons, examining if parent scaffolding during a structured spatial task differs with child sex. Participants were 45 (25 girls, 20 boys) 4- and 5- year-olds (M = 4.82, SD = 0.42) and their parent. Parent-child dyads were invited to create a pattern using magnets of different shapes and sizes. Parents provided more guidance to younger children. The result yielded a significant effect of child sex on iconic parents’ gestures, but not any other parent behaviors. Parents, whether interacting with a son or daughter, actively guided their children using pedagogical questions, spatial language, gestures, and correction.

However, little is known about the development of the literacy of CT in children, mainly because of the lack of proper psychometric assessments. We developed the first psychometrically validated assessment on the literacy of CT of children in Chinese elementary schools, coined as the Computational Thinking Assessment for Chinese Elementary Students (CTA-CES). Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach’s alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide. © The Author(s) 2021.

Psychological science has absorbed knowledge from different spheres such as psychometrics, mathematics, statistics, and psychology to develop methods for identifying cognitively gifted children. The study of intelligence has a long history and has been influenced by social environment, wars, education systems and revolutions. In this paper we focus on two main techniques of identifying cognitively gifted children (a) intelligence testing and (b) domain specific exams called Olympiads (e.g., math and physics). We provide a short historical perspective of the evolution of intelligence testing in Europe and the USA and domain specific Olympiads in Russia. We discuss advantages and limitations of both techniques. Moreover, we highlight that cognitive neuroscientists have been trying to understand the brain mechanisms that may drive cognitive abilities in highly performing children using neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We summarize the knowledge we gained to date from fMRI studies and show that the majority of studies examine mathematically gifted male adolescents with mental rotation tasks. Despite critical advances there is still a lot to be done in understanding the semantic brain-behavior relations in cognitively gifted children. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

Advances in child development and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0065-2407(08)60414-0	We expect that many readers encountered this article with the beliefs that maps are highly specialized devices primarily used for wayfinding; that they represent the  spatial world in a single, correct form; that they are readily transparent; and that  their sole contribution to psychology is their role in externalizing environmental  cognition. By discussing the myriad functions and forms of maps, by highlighting  their symbolic nature, and by considering some of the misconceptions about maps, we  have attempted to demonstrate the value of maps for addressing a wide range of  developmental questions. Our review of past research literature suggests that  research conducted within individual disciplines has both strengths and limitations.  Work in the psychological tradition is characterized by attention to important  subject characteristics and to carefully described and implemented research designs,  procedures, coding, and analyses. At the same time, this work reveals, at best,  highly restricted views about maps, and at worst, fundamental misconceptions about  maps. Work in the geographic and environmental traditions, in contrast, samples a  broader range of map forms and functions, but it suffers from inattention to  procedural details that makes the conclusions less compelling than they might  otherwise be. A conventional wisdom is emerging from the work in both traditions:  That children's map understanding occurs extremely early and extremely easily. The  limitations of both research traditions, however, suggest the need for caution in  accepting this view. Developmental and cartographic theories provide a compelling  reason to reexamine the early and easy view and suggest the need for alternative  conceptual and empirical approaches. We have argued that future work should  integrate the traditions of psychology and geography. Illustrative data from an  interdisciplinary program of research were presented. We described work  demonstrating the gradual and difficult process of mastering the representational  and geometric correspondences that link the map to its referent in the world. Our  data suggest that there are significant achievements in map conceptualization (the  understanding of the concept of a map), map identification (understanding the formal  components of a map), and map utilization (the ability to use maps). Our data  support the view that maps are not transparent and that children's abilities to  understand, use, and create maps are linked to their developing representational and  spatial skills. In concluding, we should acknowledge that we have deliberately  pushed interpretations about understanding maps as symbolic representations to the  extreme. The reason for this strategy is simple: We believe that work on maps--both  in the public schools and in academia--is assumed to be an expendable and irrelevant  luxury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Here we provide a general definition of graphic representations and discuss some similarities and differences to more commonly studied linguistic representations. We then focus on characteristics of one particular type of graphic representation-those that represent the world or "geo" and hence, "GEO-graphics." Through the use of models from cartography, we highlight qualities of representational and geometric correspondences between the referent space and the GEO-graphic representation, and suggest that an understanding of these graphics rests on the child's developing representational and spatial skills more generally. Empirical data on elementary-school children's interpretations of GEO-graphics illustrate the emergence of understanding in this domain. Finally, we suggest that the development of children's understanding of representation may be characterized as progressing from syncretism, to syncretic representation, to naive conventional representation, and finally to meta-representation. © 1992.

We then describe the development and evaluation of one such curriculum-Where Are We? (WAW?; Kastens, 2000)-designed to simulate real-world map-navigation experience. We close by proposing five components that should be included when evaluating any developmentally motivated curriculum for teaching real-world knowledge, illustrating each component by reference to our ongoing WAW? evaluation research. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12090	Researchers have shown that young children solve mapping tasks in small spaces, but have rarely tested children's performance in large, unfamiliar environments. In the  current research, children (9-10 years; N = 40) explored an unfamiliar campus and  marked flags' locations on a map. As hypothesized, better performance was predicted  by higher spatial-test scores, greater spontaneous use of map-space coordinating  strategies, and participant sex (favoring boys). Data supported some but not all  hypotheses about the roles of specific spatial skills for mapping performance. Data  patterns were similar on a computer mapping task that displayed environmental-scale  videos of walks through a park.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01175	Preterm children are at increased risk for poor academic achievement, especially in math. In the present study, we examined whether preterm children differ from  term-born children in their intuitive sense of number that relies on an unlearned,  approximate number system (ANS) and whether there is a link between preterm  children's ANS acuity and their math abilities. To this end, 6.5-year-old extremely  preterm (i.e., <27 weeks gestation, n = 82) and term-born children (n = 89)  completed a non-symbolic number comparison (ANS acuity) task and a standardized math  test. We found that extremely preterm children had significantly lower ANS acuity  than term-born children and that these differences could not be fully explained by  differences in verbal IQ, perceptual reasoning skills, working memory, or attention.  Differences in ANS acuity persisted even when demands on visuo-spatial skills and  attention were reduced in the ANS task. Finally, we found that ANS acuity and math  ability are linked in extremely preterm children, similar to previous results from  term-born children. These results suggest that deficits in the ANS may be at least  partly responsible for the deficits in math abilities often observed in extremely  preterm children.

Restorative neurology and neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.3233/RNN-160640	BACKGROUND: Motor imagery is used for treatment of motor deficits after stroke. Clinical observations suggested that motor imagery abilities might be reduced in  patients with severe sensory deficits. This study investigated the influence of  somatosensory deficits on temporal (mental chronometry, MC) and spatial aspects of  motor imagery abilities. METHODS: Stroke patients (n = 70; <6 months after stroke)  were subdivided into 3 groups according to their somatosensory functions. Group 1  (n = 31) had no sensory deficits, group 2 (n = 27) had a mild to moderate sensory  impairment and group 3 (n = 12) had severe sensory deficits. Patients and a healthy  age-matched control group (n = 23) participated in a mental chronometry task (Box  and Block Test, BBT) and a mental rotation task (Hand Identification Test, HIT). MC  abilities were expressed as a ratio (motor execution time-motor imagery time/motor  execution time). RESULTS: MC for the affected hand was significantly impaired in  group 3 in comparison to stroke patients of group 1 (p = 0.006), group 2 (p = 0.005)  and healthy controls (p < 0.001). For the non-affected hand MC was similar across  all groups. Stroke patients had a slower BBT motor execution than healthy controls  (p < 0.001), and group 1 executed the task faster than group 3 (p = 0.002). The  percentage of correct responses in the HIT was similar for all groups. CONCLUSION:  Severe sensory deficits impair mental chronometry abilities but have no impact on  mental rotation abilities. Future studies should explore whether the presence of  severe sensory deficits in stroke patients reduces the benefit from motor imagery  therapy.

Results indicated that FMRP levels were not predictive of outcome on the neuropsychological tests but that performance on the executive functioning task tended to worsen with chronological age. This age effect was not observed on the tests of visual-spatial abilities or verbal fluency. These data indicate that relative deficits in executive functioning in girls with FXS become more pronounced with age. In contrast, the relative deficits in spatial and verbal abilities of these girls did not appear to increase with age, suggesting that these abilities may be spared. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This calls for new approaches in evaluation and development of relevant abilities and skills. However, the current educational systems might miss some students who have high potential for this field or who can develop such potential. For example, according to the results of one Russian study, gifted children may be missed by existing methods of talent search, partially due to the lack of standardised psychometric tests, especially of abilities beyond verbal and numerical abilities. One important predictor of STEM, often neglected in education, is spatial ability. Recently an online short spatial ability battery (OSSAB) for use in adolescent populations was developed. However, no published norms are available. The aim of this study was to develop normalised thresholds for spatial ability testing using OSSAB battery with Russian 13-17 year old schoolchildren. Schoolchildren from the Sirius Educational Centre, demonstrating high achievement in 3 different areas: science (N = 640; 238 females), sports (N = 436; 67 females) and art (N = 260; 204 females), and schoolchildren (N = 752; 350 females) from general education schools of the Russian Federation participated in the study. Age of participants: 13-17 (M = 15.01; SD = 1.18). The study identified thresholds for 8 spatial ability levels: from Very low ability to Extraordinary giftedness. These thresholds can be used by teachers and school psychologists to determine the level of spatial ability in schoolchildren of 13-17 years of age. Based on individual students' current levels of spatial ability, teachers can provide individual support and recommendations. For high performance recommendations may include additional classes in STEM or natural sciences, for example, electronics, robotics, programming, physics or chemistry. For lower performance recommendations may include computer games containing spatial components; sports; playing musical instruments; origami classes; and studying the Chinese language. More broadly, school curricula in different subjects should include more spatial elements, such as: inclusion of stereometric tasks in learning materials; computer programs for modelling in teaching geometry and other subjects; adding visualizations (graphs and tables) when explaining material. Overall, the results of this study suggest that a significant number of children have very low or very high level of spatial ability in both mainstream schools and in educational centres for high-preforming students. The norms developed in this study can be used for identification and individualized support in all educational settings. © 2021 Tomsk State University. All rights reserved.

The present study tracked 4-year-old Chinese children’s eye movements while they were reading simulated storybook pages. Their eye-movement patterns were examined in relation to their word learning gains. The same reading list, consisting of 20 two-character Chinese words, was used in the pretest, 5-min eye-tracking learning session, and posttest. Additionally, visual spatial skill and phonological awareness were assessed in the pretest as cognitive controls. The results showed that the children’s attention was attracted quickly by pictures, on which their attention was focused most, with only 13% of the time looking at words. Moreover, significant learning gains in word reading were observed, from the pretest to posttest, from 5-min exposure to simulated storybook pages with words, picture and pronunciation of two-character words present. Furthermore, the children’s attention to words significantly predicted posttest reading beyond socioeconomic status, age, visual spatial skill, phonological awareness and pretest reading performance. This eye-movement evidence of storybook reading by children as young as four years, reading a non-alphabetic script (i.e., Chinese), has demonstrated exciting findings that children can learn words effectively with minimal exposure and little instruction; these findings suggest that learning to read requires attention to the basic words itself. The study contributes to our understanding of early reading acquisition with eye-movement evidence from beginning readers. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

In this longitudinal study, 106 kindergarteners in Hong Kong were tested on visual spatial skill and Chinese character reading ability in their first, second, and third years of kindergarten (K1, K2, and K3) with 12-month intervals between the three testing points. Cross-lagged path analysis showed a bidirectional relationship between visual spatial skill and Chinese character reading ability from K1 to K2. Children's visual spatial skill in K1 predicted their reading ability in K2 (B = 0.35, SE = 0.17, p < .05, β = .17), and their reading ability in K1 explained the unique variance of visual spatial skill measured in K2 (B = 0.29, SE = 0.12, p < .05, β = .25). In total, it explained 19.4% (p < .01) and 35.8% (p < .001) variance of visual spatial skill at T2 and reading ability at T2. However, the bidirectional relationship diminished between K2 and K3. The results demonstrate the developmental course of the relationship between visual spatial skill and reading ability as well as the reciprocal facilitation of the two skills in the beginning phase of reading development but not later phases. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The premise of the study was that providing an enrichment program in an area of students' cognitive strength would positively impact their classroom behaviors. This empirical investigation used a pre- and post-test design with random assignment to an experimental group (n=12) and a control group (n=11) of 3rd 4 th, and 5th grade elementary school students in a school district with a large number of disadvantaged and minority students. Participants of the intervention were chosen on the basis of above average visual-spatial skills as measured by the Culture Fair Intelligence Test (Cattell, 1973) and were identified by their teachers as struggling with the traditional curriculum. The intervention was an after-school enrichment program that involved building a series of eight engineering projects. Teachers of the students completed the subscales for leadership, social skills, and attention problems from the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children, Second Edition (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004) at three measurement dates (pre-test, post-test, and post-control intervention). A multivariate covariate analysis (MANCOVA) was conducted after the experimental group completed the enrichment program that compared the changes in behavior between the experimental and control groups. There was no significant measured effect noted in the experimental group, when the experimental group was compared to the control group after the intervention. However, there was a significant change in the measured behaviors of the control group following their participation in the intervention, including an increase in the behaviors associated with leadership, and a reduction in attention problems. The inconsistency of these results may be attributable to differences between the two groups and supports the need for additional research to determine the effects of domain-specific interventions. The results of this study suggest that interventions that are targeted at students' cognitive strength may help them develop better problem-solving skills, and also improve their engagement in the classroom.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1985.tb00093.x	Long-term memory retrieval efficiency was investigated as a potential underlying source of individual and developmental differences in cognitive functioning. Fourth-grade, eighth-grade, and college-aged subjects participated in a task using the Posner letter-matching paradigm. Letter pairs were presented simultaneously under physical-match and name-match instruction conditions. Reaction times were used to estimate parameters of long-term memory retrieval efficiency, basic encoding, decision, and response time, and name and physical output interference. Psychometric tests of verbal and spatial ability were included to assess convergent and discriminant validity of hypothesized relationships between aptitude test performance and basic cognitive processes. Developmental differences were observed in most but not all of the processing variables. Individual difference analyses indicated that less confounded estimates of processing parameters were not systematically related to verbal ability at any age level. Basic encoding and response speed was the most consistent correlate of spatial ability. The results suggest difficulties in previous interpretations of NIPI-verbal ability relationships. The study of cognitive processes in interaction and embedded in meaningful tasks is discussed.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The ability of mental rotation is not only an important part of spatial ability, but also a significant component of intelligence. The study on mental rotation is a frequently-discussed subject in psychology as well as in preschool education. The paper reviewed previous experiments, finding that there are some differences in the experiment materials. Accordingly, it assumes that the differences of experiment materials lead to differences of mental rotation. Based on previous experiments, we take more materials as the stimulus in the experiment in order to find the developmental characteristics of children in mental rotation. We take a 3*3*2 design, using pictures, abstract figures and geometrical figures as the stimulus. The methods of oral report and an intelligence test are also be used to explore mental rotation of children from 3 to 6 years old. To summarize, across the experiment, we present three conclusions as follows: Children begin to rotate an object mentally when they are four years old. Maybe it is a critical period for the development of mental rotation. In this experiment we can not find the sex differences in mental rotation. But we find that different materials can lead to different results. We can get the highest score when the stimulus is picture and we can get the lowest score when the stimulus is geometrical figure. The score resulting from the abstract figure is between the other two types of figures. Children aged 4 to 6 can take the strategy of mental rotation to finish the task, while the children younger than 4 can not take the strategy to do that. The study provides some suggestions to preschool education: we should value children’s ability of mental rotation; take emphasis on individual differences and culture differences in preschool education; pay attention to the effect of action in early childhood; set up appropriate curriculum to develop children’s related cognitive abilities.Alternate abstract:心理旋转是人在头脑中将某个图形的映像做平面或立体转动的心理运作过程。心理旋转能力不仅是空间能力的一个重要组成部分，而且是智力的一个重要组成部分。对心理旋转的研究一直是心理学的重要课题，对这项能力的研究也可以为学前教育提供重要参考。 纵览有关心理旋转能力的研究后发现，不论是在研究对象上，还是对研究结果的分析上，都存在一定的不足。本研究以这些研究为基础，采用了更为多样的刺激材料，试图完善相关研究。 研究采用3（刺激材料）×3（年龄）×2（性别）的实验设计。其中，三种刺激材料分别为具体图像、抽象图形、几何图形，并配合相应研究方法，了解儿童在完成任务中所采用的策略，同时，以瑞文标准联合测验对所有被试进行测试，来探查3~6岁儿童心理旋转能力的发展特征。 结果表明，4岁以下儿童尚不具有心理旋转能力；4~6岁儿童心理旋转能力随年龄而发展；4岁左右可能是心理旋转发展的关键年龄。在4~6岁儿童的心理旋转能力上未能发现性别差异。儿童在不同的刺激材料上得分存在显著性差异，具体图像得分最高，抽象图形次之，几何图形最差。在策略选择上，3~4岁儿童没有采用心理旋转的策略来完成任务，4~6岁儿童应用了心理旋转的策略来完成任务。 本研究结论对于学前教育具有重要启示：我们应该正确看待心理旋转的价值，关注个体差异，因材施教，关注动作在儿童早期发展中的作用，重视文化和教育对儿童心理旋转能力发展的影响，并创设活动情境，来促进儿童相关能力的发展。	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		3	1	0	1	1	0	0	1

This insufficiency leads to an absence of sound localization abilities and a decrease in speech intelligibility in noisy environments. SSD occurring in children further affects their language learning and cognitive abilities and their academic performance because they lack spatial abilities and binaural hearing. The early stages of central auditory system development are critical for auditory function development and morphological refinement. SSD occurring in the critical period can cause significant lateralization in the bilateral auditory pathway. This may increase the risk that affected individuals cannot re-establish binaural benefits after rehabilitation of hearing loss in the post-sensitive period. For otorhinolaryngologists, there is the concern that children with congenital SSD cannot benefit from cochlear implantation. Only a few studies have investigated auditory rehabilitation in children with congenital SSD with cochlear implantation and their results were inconsistent. The present review aims to clarify the main problems and challenges of clinical rehabilitation of congenital SSD, particularly focusing on the effect of CI on sound localization ability in children with congenital SSD. © The Author(s) 2020.

Archives of pediatrics & adolescent medicine	https://doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.157.6.593	BACKGROUND: Early malnutrition is linked to poor cognition, but long-term effects have not been extensively examined and psychosocial confounds have not always been  controlled. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that malnutrition at age 3 years will  be associated with poorer cognitive ability at age 11 years independent of  psychosocial confounds. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal study of a birth cohort  of 1559 children originally assessed at age 3 years for malnutrition (low hemoglobin  level, angular stomatitis, kwashiorkor, and sparse, thin hair) and followed up to  age 11 years. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A community sample of 1559 children (51.4%  boys and 48.6% girls) born between September 1, 1969, and August 31, 1970, in 2  towns in the island of Mauritius, with 68.7% Indians and 25.7% Creoles (African  origin). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Verbal and spatial ability measured at ages 3 and 11  years and reading, scholastic ability, and neuropsychologic performance measured at  age 11 years. RESULTS: Malnourished children had poorer cognition at both ages.  Deficits were stable across time, applied to all sex and ethnic groups, and remained  after controlling for multiple measures of psychosocial adversity. Children with 3  indicators of malnutrition had a 15.3-point deficit in IQ at age 11 years.  CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition at age 3 years is associated with poor cognition at age 11  years independent of psychosocial adversity. Promoting early childhood nutrition  could enhance long-term cognitive development and school performance, especially in  children with multiple nutritional deficits.

Previous research has demonstrated that children have difficulty using relative spatial position to distinguish between visually identical locations in space. Research on children's understanding of analogy has shown, however, that children are capable of managing multiple spatial relations when the relations are embedded in the context of a familiar analogy. I suggested that spatial analogies such as “Italy is shaped like a boot” may be extremely serviceable in helping children to distinguish and to transform identical spatial locations, tasks that they typically find difficult. The series of three experiments reported here tested the hypothesis that spatial analogies highlight the spatial relational information that is crucial for remembering and mentally transforming spatial locations. Experiment 1 revealed that 4- and 5-year-olds who searched for a sticker hidden within a small configuration of locations subdivided the locations according to whether they were located in the right or left half of the configuration instead of subdividing them into the conceptual parts suggested by the spatial analogy. Experiment 2 demonstrated that older (7-year-old) children who studied and mentally transformed arrays of locations were more successful at recognizing the outcome of the transformation (picture selection) than anticipating the new position of single locations selected at random (item location). Using a spatial analogy to describe the array did not eliminate this task-related difference and errors suggested that children's performance was guided by the basic spatial properties of the array and not the analogical relation. Finally, Experiment 3 tested the influence of spatial analogies on children's ability to distinguish between a much larger number of identical hiding locations. Children who were asked to find a sticker hidden in 1 of 27 identical locations were more successful when they associated the configuration of locations with a familiar concept. Taken together, these findings suggest that children resort to basic strategies when faced with simple memory tasks but that spatial analogies provide a powerful source of information when children are faced with the difficult task of remembering and transforming complex spatial information.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.591308	This study aimed to investigate how visual-spatial ability predicted academic achievement through arithmetic and reading abilities. Four hundred and ninety-nine  Chinese children aged from 10.1 to 11.2 years were recruited and measured  visual-spatial, arithmetic, and reading abilities. Their mathematical and Chinese  language academic achievements were collected for two consecutive school years,  respectively, during the same year as cognitive tests and 1 year after the cognitive  tests. Correlation analysis indicated that visual-spatial, arithmetic, and reading  abilities and academic achievements were significantly correlated with each other.  The structural equation modelling analyses showed that there were two paths from  visual-spatial ability to academic achievement: a major path mediated by arithmetic  ability and a minor serial mediation path from visual-spatial ability to arithmetic  ability to reading ability, then to academic achievement. Results shed light on the  importance of visual-spatial ability in education.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Previous studies have documented that mental rotation capacity develops rapidly in early years and can be enhanced through training. However, few studies have estimated the training effects of video games on the mental rotation performance of preschoolers, particularly with respect to gender differences and ability levels. This study, therefore, aimed to examine whether video game training can facilitate the mental rotation development of young children, and whether gender- or ability-based discrepancies can be moderated via intervention. We randomly assigned 40 five- to six-year-olds to one of two treatment conditions: an intervention group (playing My Little Pony Rotate Puzzle) or a control group (receiving no training). The former played the allocated video game for six min/day for five consecutive days, while the control group continued with their routine activities. Video game training led to significant improvements in mental rotation ability, and the training effects gradually became larger as the degree of rotation increased. Boys outperformed girls at pre-test but gender differences were remarkably lessened by training. Initial ability differences in the intervention group also disappeared after training, and children who scored low at pre-test improved most through the intervention. Our findings imply that video game training can reduce gender and ability disadvantages in mental rotation, and may serve as an effective alternative to traditional intervention programs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the reciprocal longitudinal relations between spatial skills and three types of counting sequence knowledge (counting range, counting forward, and counting backward), which were measured at three time points between ages 3 to 4 years in a group of 109 young Hong Kong children. A series of family background and domain-general variables (i.e., family SES, vocabulary knowledge and behavioral regulation) were measured as covariates. Results from the cross-lagged panel analyses showed a reciprocal relationship between the children's counting sequence knowledge and their spatial skills, but this relationship only occurred between Time 2 (i.e., fall semester in the first year of kindergarten) and Time 3 (i.e., spring semester in the first year of kindergarten) and not between Time 1 (i.e., end of the nursery year) and Time 2. Further analyses showed that this pattern of results was task dependent. Reciprocal relations were found only in the counting range task and the counting backward task; no reciprocal relationship was found between spatial skills and the counting forward task. The findings reveal the developmental reciprocal link between spatial skills and early mathematics competency (i.e., the production of counting lists) and further highlight that this link varies according to children's conceptual levels of counting knowledge. Implications for classroom practices and teaching strategies are discussed. © 2021	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	not accessible via MPI CBS	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	3	3	0	0	1

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1006/jecp.1996.0057	Eighty 4-year-old children (40 boys and 40 girls) were tested on a kinesthetic acuity test (KAT), half in the presence of extra visual-spatial cues and half in the  absence of these cues. All subjects were also tested on a three-dimensional block  design test, a measure of visual-spatial ability. It was found that for both sexes  KAT performance in the presence of the extra cues was superior to performance in  their absence. In the presence of the cues boys performed significantly better than  girls but when the extra cues were absent, the gender difference disappeared. There  was a significant gender difference in performance on the block design test and a  strong correlation between block design and KAT (with extra cues) performance for  both sexes. When KAT cues were reduced, this correlation was substantially reduced.  The results indicated that the gender difference in KAT performance found previously  in the presence of extra visual-spatial cues was due to differential use of these  cues rather than to a gender difference in kinesthetic acuity.

Despite recovery without neurological deficits, however, a diffuse encephalopathy may remain, with emotional and psychological sequelae that will interfere with rehabilitation and social reintegration. The present study evaluates quality of life, degree of cognitive dysfunction, and adjustment of patients with a satisfactory neurological recovery after aneurysm operation in the acute stage following a major subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Of 118 patients with a good neurological recovery, 40 patients were randomly sampled for a cross-sectional study and subjected to a questionnaire relating to their symptoms, a clinical interview, and a comprehensive neuropsychological investigation. The time interval between SAH and assessment varied between 14 months and 7 years, averaging 3 1/2 years. By means of standardized psychometric testing of intellectual capacity, memory functions, visuo-spatial abilities, perceptual speed and accuracy, and concept formation, degrees of cognitive impairment ranging from slight to severe dysfunction were identified. The results suggest that these disturbances may be permanent. The degree of impairment appeared to correlate with the patients' age. Interview data revealed substantial post-hemorrhagic maladjustment with respect to vitality, social management, self-assertion, emotional control, temperament, mood, and cognitive abilities. These findings were considerably at variance with the symptoms reported. It is stressed that, in the absence of gross neurological deficits, vital information on post-hemorrhage adjustment and impairment may easily be overlooked due to psychological defensive measures. It remains an open question whether post-SAH encephalopathy is enhanced by surgery performed in the acute stage.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Information was collected on the clarity of protocol, task difficulty, task length, and gender differences on the Mental Transformation Task. The implications and recommendations for this study and future research could benefit researchers and teachers by providing suggestions to improve the validity of the Mental Transformation Task for use in determining if changes in mental rotation occur during block building.

The child's  mother said that she forgets things and "has trouble with reading and writing fast."  The patient's 10-year-old brother has an individualized education plan and is in a  substantially separate classroom. He has inclusion activities of recess, art, and  music. He receives speech-language therapy and academic support for reading and  writing. The patient's mother becomes tearful and shares that Child Protective  Services was notified because of her inability to request the school evaluation, but  a case was not opened.Developmental evaluation reveals expressive language at a  33-month-old level and receptive language at a 39-month-old level. Cognitive testing  shows extremely low verbal comprehension, borderline visual spatial skills, and  fluid reasoning in the low average range. Working memory and processing speed fall  in the borderline range. The clinician learns at a follow-up visit that the  patient's mother was evaluated by state disability services and has mild  intellectual disability.What is your next step in management?

This model consisted of sex of the student as the exogenous variable. Verbal ability; spatial ability; attitude toward school, learning, teacher, and mathematics; and mathematical problem solving were endogenous variables.    Sex of the student was hypothesized to directly affect verbal ability, spatial ability, and attitude but not mathematical problem-solving ability or mathematical achievement. Indirect effects of sex on mathematical ability were hypothesized through the endogenous variables. The endogenous variables were hypothesized to directly affect mathematical achievement, and to produce indirect effects on mathematical achievement through their causal relationships with each other.    The sample included 73 boys and 83 girls from first-grade classes in New York City. Verbal ability and mathematical achievement were assessed by the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, vocabulary, reading comprehension, mathematical concepts, and computation subtests, level C. Spatial ability was assessed through the Arlin-Hills Attitude Surveys. Mathematical problem solving was assessed by addition and subtraction tasks, and linear measurement tasks which have previously been used in research with young children.    An analysis of the causal model was provided with the use of LISREL. A measure of goodness of fit of the model was provided with the chi-square statistic. Results indicated that variables predicting mathematical achievement affect mathematical achievement directly, and indirectly through endogenous variables. While the paths between sex and verbal ability and sex and attitude were not significant, these paths approach significance. Direct and indirect effects for verbal ability and spatial ability were found on mathematical achievement. Similarly, mathematical problem solving also had a significant effect on mathematical achievement. The attitude variable did not show a significant effect on mathematical achievement.    Concurrent validity was established for verbal, spatial, and problem-solving tasks, but not for the attitude survey. Based upon the results, three alternative, but more restricted, models were assessed.    A better fit of the model was provided when the attitude variables were constrained, but not evidenced when an alternative spatial construct was hypothesized.

A new measure of relative finger length (the length of a given finger relative to the sum of all four fingers) was investigated, and shown to be superior to the traditional 2D:4D for discriminating between the sexes. It also had the advantage of permitting a more analytic approach: for example, the 2nd finger-length contributed much more than the 4th finger length to the sex difference in 2D:4D, and a smooth gradient of sex differences across the hand was evident. Sex differences on right hands were greater than those for left hands. Within-sex correlations were obtained between the various finger-length measures and a personality and an ability scale that showed relatively large sex differences (Eysenck's Psychoticism scale and the spatial subscale from Jackson's Multidimensional Aptitude Battery). The correlations were low, but on the whole consistent with the between-sex differences for the girls. For the boys, this was so for Psychoticism, but spatial ability was, if anything, correlated in the opposite direction. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Archives of sexual behavior	https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1022496207882	A number of trait measures, possibly reflective of prenatal hormonal effects, were obtained in studies of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and auditory evoked potentials  (AEPs) carried out with male and female heterosexual and homosexual/bisexual college  students. Most of the measures were from a self-report questionnaire; others were  from experimenters' ratings or cognitive tests (Mental Rotation Test and Water Level  Test). The questionnaire, test, and rating measures included physical  characteristics (e.g., height, body type, eye color); spatial abilities; sex roles  and sexual orientation; childhood gender nonconformity; and, in the OAE study,  presence of homosexuality or bisexuality among relatives. Correlations with sexual  orientation were most often consistent with the hypothesis that male homosexuals  were undermasculinized and female homosexuals overmasculinized. Some correlations of  the questionnaire, test, and rating measures with auditory measures were observed,  but most of these were reduced or eliminated by statistically controlling for sex.  In supplementary analyses, pigmentation measures appeared to be unrelated to OAEs,  and data relevant to several hypotheses in the sexual orientation literature were  briefly examined, including childhood gender nonconformity, X-linkage, handedness,  and the tendency of homosexuality to run in families.

Research in developmental disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2011.02.008	This study explored the cognitive performance of children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and/or Developmental Coordination Disorder  (DCD) using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. Participants were 62  children with ages between 9 years 8 months and 12 years 7 months. These children  were placed into one of the four groups: Comparison (n=26), ADHD (n=14), DCD (n=11),  and ADHD+DCD (n=11) groups. The ADHD symptoms were assessed using the Australian  Disruptive Behaviours Scale, and motor ability was assessed using the McCarron  Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND). Significantly poorer perceptual  reasoning ability was seen in DCD and ADHD+DCD groups but not in the ADHD group. The  findings provide evidence that a deficit in visuo-spatial ability may underlie DCD  but not ADHD. These findings revealed different cognitive profiles for ADHD and/or  DCD, thus the current study does not lend support to the common aetiology hypothesis  in understanding the basis of ADHD and DCD comorbidity.

Furthermore, the association between the ability to state the principle of the water-level task verbally and performance on other types of spatial tasks (mental rotation and embedded figures task) were analyzed. Subjects participating in the present longitudinal study were 508 children and adolescents of grades 2 to 10. Based on binomial mixture analyses, three-subgroups showing different response behaviors on the water-level task were distinguished: (a) bottom parallel, (b) randomlike, and (c) correct responders. The results show a high probability of correct task solutions for subjects with a verbally expressed understanding of the water-level principle. This was not only true at the same time of measurement, but also later in that knowledge of the principle enhance performance. Furthermore, verbal knowledge about the principle of the water-level task is related to the performance on other types of spatial tasks.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, it is currently not understood how these cognitive processes develop and interact longitudinally at the within-person level–either within or across genders. In this study, 553 students (52% girls) were assessed from fifth to seventh grades on 3-d mental rotation spatial skills (assessed each fall) and numerical and algebraic math reasoning skills (assessed each spring). Boys outperformed girls on mental rotation tests across all three grades, and on fifth and seventh grade math reasoning tests. Consistent with the literature on between-person comparisons, there was a positive correlation between mental rotation and math reasoning skills in the full sample and for both genders. A random intercept cross-lagged panel model was used to control for these confounding group-level differences in order to isolate within-person associations between earlier and later performance. Initially in fifth grade, math reasoning predicted subsequent sixth grade mental rotation skills. By seventh grade, more advanced mental rotation skills were associated with subsequent math reasoning skills while math reasoning skills were no longer predictive of mental rotation skills. An examination of gender differences revealed that this pattern was driven by boys while girls experienced less within-person change. These findings suggest that boys may initially rely in part on their math reasoning skills to solve 3-d mental rotation tasks. However, as their 3-d mental rotation skills mature, they begin to primarily depend upon these developing spatial skills to solve math reasoning problems rather than the reverse. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

Observational measures of videotaped mother-child interactions from the Boston site of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 140) were used to examine the effectiveness of support for spatial concept learning and planning during a block building play activity. Trained observers rated maternal support of children's learning of spatial concepts through spatial language and gestures, with higher ratings involving explanations and encouragement of children's use of spatial concepts. This measure was predictive of math achievement at 4 ½ years when controlling for length of the parent-child observation, child gender, ethnicity, and IQ at 2 years, as well as maternal years of education, verbal intelligence, income-to-needs averaged from 1 to 36 months, parenting stress, general cognitive stimulation, and maternal support of numerical concepts during the same observation. Maternal support of children's planning skills, also rated by trained observers during the block building activity, involved identifying incremental steps to reach the block building goal, with higher ratings given for encouraging planning on the part of the child. This measure was predictive of math achievement at 4 ½ years, as well as reading achievement at both 4 ½ years and first grade, suggesting that maternal planning support has associations with the two key measures of school readiness, while maternal spatial support may be specific to mathematics. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This claim is not without some theoretical significance in view of the evidence suggesting that spatial ability is relatively immune from such environmental effects. The Dirks study involved a game that is nearly identical to the BD subtest. The present experiment investigated two spatial games of lessor but more typical similarity by using the WPPSI.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2018.09.018	Nonsymbolic numerical magnitude processing skills are assumed to be fundamental to mathematical learning. Recent findings suggest that visual-spatial skills account  for associations between children's performance in visually presented nonsymbolic  numerical magnitude comparison tasks and their performance in visually presented  arithmetic tasks. The aim of the current study was to examine whether associations  between children's performance in visually presented tasks assessing nonsymbolic  numerical magnitude processing skills and their performance in tasks assessing early  mathematical skills, which do not involve visual stimulation, may also be mediated  by visual-spatial skills. This line of reasoning is based on the assumption that  children make use of mental visualization processes when working on tasks assessing  early mathematical skills, such as knowledge of the sequence of number words, even  when these tasks do not involve visual stimulation. We assessed 4- to 6-year-old  children's performance in a nonsymbolic numerical magnitude comparison task, in  tasks concerning knowledge of the sequence of number words, and in a developmental  test to assess visual-spatial skills. Children's nonsymbolic numerical magnitude  processing skills were found to be associated with their number word sequence  skills. This association was fully mediated by interindividual differences in  visual-spatial skills. The effect size of this mediation effect was small. We assume  that the ability to construct mental visualizations constitutes the key factor  underlying this mediation effect.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The administrative conditions of these computerized tasks are highly standardized. Three of these tasks, Spatial Visualization, Perception and Spatial Relations, are taken from the Computerized Aptitude Test for adolescents and adults, whereas the 4th task is an adaptation for adolescents of the Puzzle subtest of the Computerized Aptitude Test for infants. The dependent variables are the average success scores and the speed of execution scores derived from latency times in a group of the best scores for each of the 4 tasks. The results show that the adolescent boys are more successful at the Spatial Visualization and Spatial Relations tasks. On the whole, the boys and the girls showed a comparable speed of success, except in the Spatial Relations subtest, where the girls were much faster. The observed differences are interpreted as reflecting the better strategies adopted by the boys to solve mental rotation tasks.

Current research seeks to understand phenotypic traits associated with this most common group of inherited epilepsies and evaluate educational and occupational trajectories. A specific deficit in executive function in a subgroup of IGE, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) has been a particular focus of recent research. This systematic review provides a quantitative synthesis of cognitive function outcomes in 26 peer-reviewed, case-control studies published since 1989. Univariate random-effects meta-analyses were conducted on seven cognitive factor-domains and separately on executive function. Patients with IGE demonstrated significantly lower scores on tests across all cognitive factor-domains except visual-spatial abilities. Effect sizes ranged from 0.42 to 0.88 pooled standard deviation units. The average reduction of scores on tests of executive function in IGE compared to controls was 0.72 standard deviation units. Contrary to current thinking, there was no specific deficit in executive function in JME samples, nor in other IGE syndromes. Of more concern, people with IGE are at risk of pervasive cognitive impairment. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Some underlying principles		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/how-is-location-information-mapped-childhood-some/docview/304953083/se-2?accountid=11531	The present study concerns a uniquely human spatial ability---the mapping of location information. To examine how children (3 to 5 years) use map-like displays to find corresponding locations in another space (an array of three objects), the type of location information available on the task was varied by using displays from different perspectives (plan vs. oblique) and positions of different types (i.e., unique vs. non-unique). To solve the task, children either had to engage in spatial-relational mapping, which involved the relative positions of objects (e.g., left-right), or they could rely on element-to-element mapping, which involved distinct cues (e.g., square-shaped object).   It has been suggested that oblique perspectives (displays depicting space from an angle diagonal to the surface) are advantageous on mapping tasks, that is, performance is better than that with plan perspectives (displays depicting space from directly overhead). Here, it is shown that there is only an advantage insofar as the task can be solved via element-to-element mapping, which is known to be easier than spatial-relational mapping. It is also shown that distinct objects cues are treated as elements, but so, too, are unique positions. Importantly, however, element-to-element mapping based on object versus position information involve different principles, as indicated by how alignment (between display and referent space) affects performance, and that object and position information is not used in combination to solve location problems. Implications are discussed in terms of how object and position elements are weighted, which may be related to an ease/accuracy trade-off approach.

Neurobiology of aging	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2011.02.013	It is unknown whether lifestyle, including mental stimulation, and appropriate training interventions, may directly improve spatial navigation performance and its  underlying neural substrates. Here we report that healthy younger and older men  performing a cognitively demanding spatial navigation task every other day over 4  months display navigation-related gains in performance and stable hippocampal  volumes that were maintained 4 months after termination of training. In contrast,  control groups displayed volume decrements consistent with longitudinal estimates of  age-related decline. Hippocampal barrier density, as indicated by mean diffusivity  estimated from diffusion tensor imaging, showed a quadratic shape of increased  density after training followed by a return to baseline in the right hippocampus,  but declined in the control groups and in the left hippocampus. We conclude that  sustained experiential demands on spatial ability protect hippocampal integrity  against age-related decline. These results provide the first longitudinal evidence  indicating that spatial navigation experience modifies hippocampal volumes in  humans, and confirm epidemiological results suggesting that mental stimulation may  have direct effects on neural integrity.

Australian Educational Researcher	https://doi.org/10.1007/s13384-021-00440-0	Large-scale spatial representations are rarely a perfect replication of the corresponding environment. Factors such as age, experience and environmental association play a significant role in each person’s cognitive map. Yet, traditional spatial tasks remove these contextual elements in determining a person’s spatial orientation skill, which has contributed to the apparent widening gap in spatial skills for children in non-urban areas. In this study we examined children’s sketch maps of their route between home and school from four geographically diverse sites (urban, regional, rural, and remote Indigenous communities). Our findings suggest children from rural and remote communities possess highly detailed and sophisticated mental representations of their local environment, outside of traditional developmental frameworks. This work provides insights into these representations through student work samples. We suggest future work consider the contextual nature of spatial skills when comparing students. © 2021, The Australian Association for Research in Education, Inc.

Aims: This study evaluated the efficacy of a visuospatial intervention programme within classrooms to determine the effect on students’ (1) spatial reasoning and (2) mathematics performance as a result of the intervention. Sample: The study involved grade six students (ages 10–12) in eight classes. There were five intervention classes (n = 120) and three non-intervention control classes (n = 66). Methods: A specifically designed 10-week spatial reasoning programme was developed collaboratively with the participating teachers, with the intervention replacing the standard mathematics curriculum. The five classroom teachers in the intervention programme presented 20 hr of activities aimed at enhancing students’ spatial visualization, mental rotation, and spatial orientation skills. Results: The spatial reasoning programme led to improvements in both spatial ability and mathematics performance relative to the control group who received standard mathematics instruction. Conclusions: Our study is the first to show that a classroom-based spatial reasoning intervention improves elementary school students’ mathematics performance. © 2017 The British Psychological Society	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Cognitive research: principles and implications	https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-018-0147-y	BACKGROUND: Spatial reasoning skill has consistently been found to be malleable. However, there is little research to date on embedding spatial training within  learning frameworks. This study evaluated the effects of a classroom-based spatial  reasoning intervention on middle school children's spatial reasoning. Participants  included 337 students from 15 classrooms across 6 schools with 8 experimental and 7  control classes. The program was designed for grades 3, 4, 5, and 6. The  intervention program was delivered within the  Experience-Language-Pictorial-Symbolic-Application (ELPSA) framework and was  delivered across 10 weeks by classroom teachers, while the control group received  standard mathematics instruction. RESULTS: Children in the experimental classes  outperformed the control classes on spatial reasoning at the conclusion of the  program. The intervention program received high levels of engagement and evidence  for development through the stages of the ELPSA framework. CONCLUSIONS: This paper  provides evidence for the effectiveness of a rich spatial training program delivered  within a learning framework. This program has applications for spatial thinking in  Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The objective of this study is to assess the cognitive functions in adolescents with AN before and after weight recovery and to explore the relationship between cognitive performance and menstruation. Methods: Twenty-five female adolescents with AN were assessed by a neuropsychological battery while underweight and then following six months of treatment and weight recovery. Twenty-six healthy female subjects of a similar age were also evaluated at both time points. Results: Underweight patients with AN showed worse cognitive performance than control subjects in immediate recall, organization and time taken to copy the Rey's Complex Figure Test (RCFT). After weight recovery, AN patients presented significant improvements in all tests, and differences between patients and controls disappeared. Patients with AN and persistence of amenorrhea at follow-up (n. = 8) performed worse on Block Design, delayed recall of Visual Reproduction and Stroop Test than patients with resumed menstruation (n. = 14) and the control group, though the two AN groups were similar in body mass index, age and psychopathological scale scores. Conclusion: Weight recovery improves cognitive functioning in adolescents with AN. The normalization of neuropsychological performance is better in patients who have recovered at least one menstrual cycle. The normalization of hormonal function seems to be essential for the normalization of cognitive performance, even in adolescents with a very short recovery time. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Journal of Child Language	https://doi.org/10.1017/S0305000906007926	We present data on the language of space in Hungarian individuals with Williams syndrome (WS; 19 in the first, 15 in the second study, between 8;0 and 21;11) and a verbal control (VC) group of typically developing (TD; 19 in the first, 15 in the second study, between 355 and 10;7) children from: (1) a study of elicited production and comprehension of spatial terms; and (2) a sentence completion task on case markers in their spatial and non-spatial use. The first study showed poorer performance in the WS group, but similar performance patterns and a special difficulty of SOURCE terms in both groups. We did not find overall group differences in the second study. We argue that WS performance patterns reflect WS spatial abilities and seem to be constrained by the same factors in WS as in TD. Results also lead us to conclude that, contrary to most previous claims, there is no selective deficit of spatial terms within WS language, and they also suggest that not all uses of spatial terms require activation of mental models of space. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.

Child: care, health and development	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00683.x	This study presents preliminary electroencephalogram (EEG) data of  children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) who executed a  mental hand rotation paradigm similar to that described by Wilson and colleagues (2004),  who sought to test whether children with DCD have difficulties  generating an accurate internal model of an intended action. Behavioural  (Shepard & Metzler 1971; Cooper & Shepard 1973, 1975), neurological (Jeannerod 1997; Kosslyn et al. 1998; Mellet et al. 1998; Parsons 2001) and neuro-imaging (positron emission tomography) (Jeannerod 1995; Crammond 1997; Kosslyn et al. 1998; Parsons 2001)  data suggest that hand rotation is a valid and reliable probe to  investigate motor imagery. Motor imagery is the ability to mentally  simulate the movement of a limb. Motor imagery tasks may be used to  measure deficiencies in the ability to generate an accurate internal  representation (or internal model) of an intended movement; the internal  model is open to conscious awareness through imagery while execution of  the overt movement plan has been inhibited. Motor imagery is thus an  excellent means by which the structure of movement representations can  be investigated (Jeannerod 1997).	SK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		7	3	0	3	3	1	0	0

Instead of the complex achromatic three-dimensional (3D) cube aggregates used with adults (Shepard & Metzler, 1971), or the flat two-dimensional animals used with children (Quaiser-Pohl, 2003), the new tests uses 3D colourful cubes, either as a standalone, or as a cube aggregate but with fewer elements. The test format is similar to the Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices Test (RCPM) which also served as a validation tool. The first new test, the Rotated Colour Cube Test (RCCT), consists of multicoloured single cubes in different orientations. Three age groups of 7- to 10-year-old children (N=100) were increasingly successful in identifying cubes, with boys from socio-economic background that did not receive state benefits performing better in the more challenging test sections. While cubes that were different to the target in terms of cube face colour made the test easier, differently oriented cubes increased task difficulty. RCCT and RCPM were correlated, with the RCCT being the easier test. The second new test development, the Coloured Mental Rotation Test (CMRT), investigated differences in set-size, angularity, and axis of rotation of coloured cube aggregates in 4- to 11-year-old children (N=80). Several higher-order interactions all involved set-size and showed that 4-cube aggregates were the most economical and best 3D object for children’s MR in all age groups. Interestingly, the linear decrease in performance with increasing angularity of 4-cube aggregates was already observed in 4-to 5-year but also still in 10- to 11-year-old boys, as well as in 6- to 7- and 8- to 9-year-old girls. It was concluded that the magical number 4, a capacity limit in attention and short-term memory (Cowan, 2001), can also be observed in MR, due to the Good Gestalt of the 4-cube aggregates.

Eighty 4- to 11-year-old mainly middle-class children (British Indian and British African majority and white minority; 40 girls and 40 boys) were assessed using the new matching-to-sample Colored Mental Rotation Test (CMRT) and, for comparison, the Raven Colored Progressive Matrices Test (RCPM). A high Cronbach’s alpha of .94 and the Rasch model demonstrated item homogeneity of the CMRT. As expected, there were main effects of age showing increases in accuracy and of sex as boys outperformed girls. A main effect of set size showed that from age four until age 10 as four-cube aggregates proved to be the most economical three-dimensional (3D) object for mental rotation. Several higher-order interactions all involved four-cube aggregates, for example, 3D cube element protrusions had the largest effect in the four-cube-aggregate. We thus suggest that the magical number four (Cowan, 2001) as an attentional limit may also be valid in mental rotation and linked to the ‘Good Gestalt’ design of the four-cube aggregate. The cross-validation of CMRT with the RCPM showed high correlations increasing from .69 in 4- to 5-year-olds to .77 in 10- to 11-year-olds. Interestingly, 4- to 5-year-olds girls scored higher in the Raven test of nonverbal reasoning than in the CRMT scores with 3D cube aggregates demonstrating the particular complexity of 3D pictorial space.

International journal of developmental science	https://doi.org/10.3233/DEV-14154	This study introduces the new Rotated Colour Cube Test (RCCT) as a measure of object identification and mental rotation using single 3D colour cube images in a  matching-to-sample procedure. One hundred 7- to 11-year-old children were tested  with aligned or rotated cube models, distracters and targets. While different  orientations of distracters made the RCCT more difficult, different colours of  distracters had the opposite effect and made the RCCT easier because colour  facilitated clearer discrimination between target and distracters. Ten-year-olds  performed significantly better than 7- to 8-year-olds. The RCCT significantly  correlated with children's performance on the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices  Test (RCPM) presumably due to the shared multiple-choice format, but the RCCT was  easier, as it did not require sequencing. Children from families with a high  socio-economic status performed best on both tests, with boys outperforming girls on  the more difficult RCCT test sections.

This leads to the expectation that males should have higher average levels of intelligence than females. Yet the consensus view is that there is no sex difference in general intelligence. An examination of the literature shows that the consensus view is wrong. Among adults, males have slightly higher verbal and reasoning abilities than females and a more pronounced superiority on spatial abilities. If the three abilities are combined to form general intelligence, the mean for males is 4 IQ points higher than the mean for females. Among children up to the age of around 14 yr the sex differences are smaller because girls mature earlier than boys. The evolutionary selection pressures responsible for greater intelligence in males are discussed. © 1994.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

The data are derived from the Japanese standardization of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised. It is found that Japanese children are marginally but significantly superior to white American children on Spearman's g. Japanese children are inferior on the group verbal factor but superior on the group perceptual factor. On the primary abilities, Japanese children are inferior on verbal comprehension and perceptual speed and superior on memory span, number, and spatial ability. It is suggested that this pattern of Japanese cognitive strengths and weaknesses helps to clarify a number of conflicting findings on Japanese intelligence. © 1985 Springer.

Demography	https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-8931725	Population-level disparities in later-life cognitive health point to the importance of family resources. Although the bulk of prior work establishes the directional  flow of resources from parents to offspring, the "linked lives" perspective raises  the question of how offspring resources could affect parental health as well. This  paper examines whether adult children's education influences older parents' (aged  50+) cognitive health in Mexico, where schooling reforms have contributed to  significant gains in the educational achievements of recent birth cohorts.  Harnessing a change in compulsory school laws and applying an instrumental variables  approach, we found that each year of offspring schooling was associated with higher  overall cognition among parents, but was less predictive across different cognitive  functioning domains. More offspring schooling improved parents' cognitive abilities  in verbal learning, verbal fluency, and orientation, but not in visual scanning,  visuo-spatial ability, or visual memory. The beneficial effects of offspring  schooling on those cognitive domains are more salient for mothers compared to  fathers, suggesting potential gendered effects in the influence of offspring  schooling. The results remained robust to controls for parent-child contact and  geographic proximity, suggesting other avenues through which offspring education  could affect parental health and a pathway for future research. Our findings  contribute to growing research which stresses the causal influence of familial  educational attainment on population health.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Spatial skills are required for all biological studies which involve microscopy; form recognition, ability to recognise objects when their orientation is altered, ability to visualise from 2-D to 3-D, in a 3-D to 2-D direction. Ability to abstract information from a background which contains irrelevant material is required in microscopy, and also for morphological studies where tissues and organs are embedded in organisms. In all sciences, ability to abstract information, to reorganise it and then use it, is required, i.e. the skill of analysis. The biological sciences differ from the physical sciences in that there are a great number of anomalies at structural, functional and developmental levels. The ability to review a range of similarities and differences, in order to consider possible inter-relationships, would probably be enhanced by the ability to think divergently. The factors which were chosen were all of a cognitive nature -spatial ability, Field Independence, analytical skills and divergence. The following tests were constructed. Test A - Test of ability to visualise a 2-D section taken from a 3-D diagram. Test B - Test of ability to visualise a 3-D object when given appropriate 2-D sections. Test C - Test of ability to recognise a shape when its orientation was changed. Test D - Test of ability to find a number of solutions to a problem using the technique of grouping items into like categories (sets). This was a test for divergence; those who gave the greatest number of responses were judged to be more divergent than those who gave fewer answers. Test E - Test of ability to abstract relevant information from a distracting background. This was a dual purpose test, testing for the spatial skill of form recognition, and also for the cognitive style of Field Independence. Test F - Test of ability to abstract relevant information, to group characteristics which were similar but not identical, and to use it in a new situation. This was a test of analytical ability. After a trial run, the tests were amended and the following samples were taken. Primary 4/5 - primary school children aged 8-9 years Primary 7 - primary school children aged 10-11 years Secondary 2 - secondary school children aged 13-14 years Secondary 4 - pupils aged 15-16 studying Scottish 'O' Grade Biology Secondary 6 - pupils aged 17-18 studying Scottish 'H' Grade Biology or G.S.Y.S. in Biology. Undergraduate Biology students - in a first year University Glass of Biology I - most students were 18-19 years. Post-graduate biologists made up of teachers, lecturers and research students. Undergraduate students in the Arts and Divinity Faculties. Post-graduate non scientists made up of teachers, lecturers, social workers and others. All tests showed an age related trend, the young children having lower scores than the older pupils; the post-graduates performing better than the undergraduates. The different aspects of spatial ability did not develop at the same rate, the 3-D to 2-D skill taking the longest to develop. Analytical ability was poorly developed at the primary school level. There were more Field Independent individuals in the biology groups than in the non science groups. Post-graduate biologists showed the following characteristics -they had good spatial ability, good analytical skills, and tended to be Field Independent. The biology students, and the S. 6 (17-18 yrs) group also had these skills but to a lesser extent. The results of Test D for divergence were inconclusive so it was not possible to judge whether the biologists were more divergent than other groups. It might be argued that the study of biology improved the cognitive skills of spatial ability, Field Independence and analysis, but what was more likely was that those who did not have these potential skills were "siphoned off" during their school years. However, these skills would be used, extended and refined in biology courses. Those who did not have the above skills would be likely to select subjects more suited to a different cognitive repertoire, and would not opt for the sciences. Although the cognitive skills of spatial ability, analysis and Field Independence seemed to contribute success in the biological sciences, they probably play a similar role in the physical sciences.

A comprehensive narrative literature review was completed to contextualise this under-researched subject area and aimed to highlight the need for early identification of atypical (as a result of better understanding typical) mathematics development.The importance of both symbolic and non-symbolic number . representation in determining later maths achievements is acknowledged and the extent to which specific deficits in these skills can be identified in preschool children is debated along with their potential to predict later mathematics achievements. A Systematic Review to specifically appraise recent studies which investigate the relevance of domain-specific predictors of mathematics before the age of six sought to support the need for early identification of key factors in early maths learning. This informed an exploratory, quantitative study which combined domain-specific and domain-general variables not previously studied together.These were considered in a local population sample of 88 preschool children in order to identify interrelationships between skills, and key predictors for maths achievement in early primary school. Results indicated a close relationship between non-symbolic and symbolic processes in preschool, and highlighted that symbolic skills along with a number of domain general and environmental factors were predictive of maths attainment after a one year follow up. Implications for future research directions, and professional practice for teachers and Educational Psychologists are considered.

Physical & occupational therapy in pediatrics		In this longitudinal study, forty-three Canadian 10-year-olds, 20 born preterm without significant health problems and 23 born at term, were compared. Cognitive  development was measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III.  Language development was measured by the Clinical Evaluation of Language  Fundamentals-3 (CELF-3) and language used in a 5 minute interview. The children born  preterm had subtle delays. They scored significantly lower on Performance IQ and the  CELF-3. The subtests on which they had lower scores appear to require visual-spatial  skills. Early intervention focusing on parent behaviours that encourage language  development and early screening for delays in visual-spatial skills may be useful.

For the 6- to 7-year-old subjects, the task consisted of looking at a figure and determining what form would be perceived when the figure was turned. A choice of figures was presented for recognition. Using a specially designed experimental device, the subjects actually rotated the two-dimensional figure in three-dimensional space and could see the deformation brought about by the perspective change they caused. During the training, the children compared the figure chosen by anticipation, with the real projection of the figure seen after rotation. The training conditions differed by the type of comparison and by the choice of figures proposed for recognition. The main results showed that (1) the children's progress depended on the training conditions, and (2) the transformations were acquired in a fixed order. Learning seems to have resulted from an interplay between two processes, a data-driven process for extracting the visual features needed for anticipating the effects of the rotation, and a process driven by symbolic representations. which constructs the responses.

Cognitive stimulation delivered through psychosocial interventions provides both psychological intervention and social stimulation to improve cognition. A pilot open-label parallel-arms randomized controlled trial was undertaken to examine the effects of art therapy (AT) and music reminiscence activity (MRA) compared to the control, on the primary outcome of neurocognitive domain assessments in elderly people with MCI. Methods: Community-living elderly people with MCI (Petersen's criteria), assessed for study eligibility, were randomized using a web-based system with equal allocation to two intervention arms: AT (guided viewing of art pieces and production of visual arts) and MRA (listening, and recalling memories related to music) and a control arm (standard care without any intervention). Interventions were led by trained therapists weekly for 3 months, then fortnightly for 6 months. Neurocognitive domains (mean of memory, attention, and visuo-spatial abilities standardized scores), psychological wellbeing (subsyndromal depression and anxiety) and telomere length as a biological marker of cellular ageing, were assessed by intervention-blinded assessors at baseline, 3 months and 9 months. Results: In total, 250 people were screened and 68 were randomized and included in the analysis. In the AT arm, neurocognitive domains improved compared to the control arm at 3 months (mean difference (d) = 0.40; 90% CI 0.126, 0.679) and were sustained at 9 months (d = 0.31; 90% CI 0.068, 0.548). There was some improvement in depression and anxiety at 3 and 9 months and in telomere length at 9 months, but this was not significant. Similar improvements were observed in the MRA arm over the control arm, but they were not significant. There were no intervention-related adverse effects. Conclusions: Art therapy delivered by trained staff as "art as therapy" and "art psychotherapy" may have been the significant contributor to cognitive improvements. The findings support cognitive stimulation for elderly people with cognitive decline and signal the need for larger studies and further investigation of carefully designed psycho-social interventions for this group.

The American journal of clinical nutrition	https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab325	BACKGROUND: Maternal intake of several nutrients during pregnancy is linked to offspring cognition. The relationship between maternal dietary patterns and  offspring cognition is less established. OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of  maternal diet quality during pregnancy with child cognition and behavior. DESIGN:  Among 1580 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a prospective pre-birth cohort, we  assessed maternal diet during pregnancy using food frequency questionnaires and  evaluated diet quality using modified versions of the Mediterranean Diet Score  (MDS-P) and Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI-P). Child cognitive and behavioral  outcomes were assessed using standardized tests and questionnaires at infancy, early  and mid-childhood. We conducted multivariable linear regression analyses. RESULTS:  Mothers were predominantly white, college-educated, and non-smokers. After  adjustment for child age and sex and maternal sociodemographic and lifestyle  characteristics, maternal high (6-9) vs. low (0-3) MDS-P during pregnancy was  associated with higher child Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-II) nonverbal  (mean difference for first trimester = 4.54; 95%CI: 1.53, 7.56) and verbal scores  (3.78; 95%CI: 1.37, 6.19), and lower Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive  Function (BRIEF) Metacognition Index (-1.76; 95%CI: -3.25, -0.27), indicating better  intelligence and fewer metacognition problems in mid-childhood. Maternal Q4 vs. Q1  AHEI-P during pregnancy was associated with higher Wide Range Assessment of Visual  Motor Abilities matching scores in early childhood (mean difference for first  trimester = 2.79; 95%CI: 0.55, 5.04), higher KBIT-II verbal scores (2.59; 95%CI:  0.13, 5.04) and lower BRIEF Global Executive Composite scores in mid-childhood  (-1.61; 95%CI: -3.20, -0.01), indicating better visual spatial skills, verbal  intelligence and executive function. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal intake of a better  quality diet during pregnancy was associated with better visual spatial skills in  the offspring at early childhood, and better intelligence and executive function in  the offspring at mid-childhood.

Available evidence indicates a functional homology between human and rat: Affective and spatial processes are disrupted upon injury to the right posterior cortex. The corpus callosum plays a critical role in the mediation of lateralized functions. Extra stimulation in infancy in rats changes their emotionality and spatial behaviour. To examine functional lateralization, localization, the role of the corpus callosum, and early experience, between birth and weaning we handled or left undisturbed male rats. In experiment 1, handled or non-handled rats received left or right parietal cortex ablation or no lesion, and were subsequently tested on two tests each of emotionality and spatial behaviour. We determined that unilateral parietal cortex lesions and early experience reliably changed emotional behaviour, but had few effects on spatial behaviour. In experiment 2, handled or non-handled rats were given left or right parietal cortex lesion plus corpus callosum section, corpus callosum section alone, or no lesion. We found that removal of parietal cortex plus section of corpus callosum attenuated emotionality in the open field, but not reactivity. Infant handling reduced emotionality of right parietal lesioned group, but increased emotionality for the left parietal lesioned group. In terms of spatial ability, rats with parietal lesions plus corpus callosum section and those with corpus callosum section were impaired at water maze learning, also handled rats were superior to non-handled rats. Handled rats were significantly biased to turn left, while non-handled rats were significantly biased to turn right. These findings demonstrate that unilateral cortical lesions reliably disrupt emotional and spatial behaviour in rats. Furthermore, the results emphasized the importance of the corpus callosum in spatial navigation and the mediation of early experience effects. Finally, the observation that lesions and early experience differently affect distinct facets of spatial and emotional behaviour suggests that researchers need to be keenly aware of the dimensionality of rodent behavioural repertoires.

Much less is known about the consequences of exposure to secondary smoke during fetal development. The present study investigates and compares the long-term consequences of active and passive smoking during pregnancy. Ninety-one children between the ages of six and nine years were tested using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. After considering potential confounds, children of nonsmoking mothers generally were found to perform better than the two smoking groups on tests of speech and language skills, intelligence, visual/spatial abilities and on the mother's rating of behavior. The performance of children of passive smokers was found, in most areas, to be between that of the active smoking and nonsmoking groups. It was concluded that there is a continuum of long-term smoking effects and that, although active maternal smoking is associated with effects of greater breadth and magnitude than passive maternal smoking, children of passive smokers are also at risk for a pattern of negative developmental outcomes. © 1991.

Visual-spatial and visual analysis skills are components of the visual motor skill. Any deficiency in Visual - Motor skills and their components often causes problem in writing and learning processes in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of occupational therapy (O.T.) intervention on visual-spatial and visual analysis skills in children with L.D. Method: Fifty-eight children with learning disorder (L.D.) from "Learning Disorders Centers "in Tehran were assessed in this study. Out of them, 23children were selected. They were in second, third and forth standard classes. They had normal I.Q and no visual or auditory problem .All of the children took the "Test of Visual Motor Skills- Revised "(TVMS-R). They were divided into two groups: 11 in experimental group and 12 in control group. O.T interventions were performed for 16 sessions in the experimental group and finally all of the children were assessed with TVMS-R again. TVMS-R includes 8 categories and is designed based on copying some geometric figures. This test was standardized in Exceptional Children Institute, Tehran in 2002. Results: There was no significant difference of means between the pretest and the post test in the control group (P=0.10), but there was a significant difference of means in the experimental group based on paired t-test (P=0.000) Conclusion: Results showed that the O.T. intervention had a statistically meaningful effect on visual-spatial and visual analysis skills in children with L.D.

Comput. Music Conf., ICMC Sound Music Comput. Conf., SMC - Music Technol. Meets Philos.: From Digit. Echos Virtual Ethos	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908876275&partnerID=40&md5=fe04ee9d8f4e46f01da287e9b175b053	Harmony has always been considered a difficult matter to learn, also by experienced musicians. The aim of this paper is to present a system designed to provide unskilled users with an indication about the sound of the different harmonic regions and to help them to build a cognitive map of their relationships, linking musical perception to spatial abilities like orientation and wayfinding. The Harmonic Walk is an interactive environment which responds to the user's position inside a rectangular space. Different chords are proposed to the user depending on her/his position. The user's task is to find and to recognize them, and, then, to decide how to link the chords producing a convincing harmonic progression. This can be made by choosing a precise path to perform the best satisfying "harmonic walk", selecting it among various possibilities. From a theoretical point of view the project is inspired to the neo-Riemannian ideas of harmony and parsimonious progressions, which try to give a wider and coherent framework to 19th century harmony and to its representation. The results of our preliminary tests confirm that, in a sample of children from 7 to 11 years old, most of the participants were able to locate the chords and to find some valid path to perform a harmonic progression.

E. Tyler (1956), was found to be still prevalent in the research literature. The hypothesis, its original data base, and more recent literature are examined. It was found that the hypothesis did not distinguish between the effects of race vs early experience on perceptual functioning. Reflecting this confusion, the authors argue that the original data base for the hypothesis was seriously flawed. Many studies assumed that the hypothesis could be demonstrated by lower scores on performance than on verbal subtests of IQ test batteries. The inadequacy of this assumption is discussed, and the use of IQ subtests to assess perceptual functioning is criticized. The need for measurement of response biases when attempting to assess group differences in perception is also stressed. An examination of the literature found few direct tests of ethnic differences in perception. Although some data tentatively suggest that there may be differences in visualization of spatial transformations, similar to the differences that have been found between the sexes, it is concluded that not enough data are available to make any general statement about ethnic differences in perception.

Two different paradigms were administered: the free-choice version for analyzing the aspects linked mainly to procedural and mnesic components, the forced-choice version for disentangling components linked to spatial working memory from the procedural ones. The findings evidenced a deficit in the acquisition of procedural competences as well as in the spatial memory processes in Williams subjects. In the free-choice paradigm, they performed worse than control subjects on all parameters analyzed. Namely, they needed more time to complete the task, did not collect all rewards, exhibited low values of the spatial span as well as low percentages of correct visits, and displayed a reduced use of the most efficient exploration strategies. Even in the forced-choice paradigm, Williams subjects made a number of errors significantly higher than control subjects. The marked impairment in spatial information processing is discussed on the light of neuro-anatomical alterations reported in Williams subjects. © 2009 ISDN.

Clear age-related improvements were evidenced. However, a temporal window with an abrupt acceleration of specific spatial competencies acquisition was detected. The females aged 51-58 months started the task performing about 2.5 errors and ended it performing no more than 0.5 errors. The same pattern of performance was exhibited by the males aged 59-66 months. Also in the final span the 4.5-year-old females behave as the 6-year-old males. The significant correlations between 45° angles and span values in the free-choice paradigm indicated that all children tended to solve the task by employing low working memory load and by using mainly efficient procedural strategies. Furthermore, children's ability to retain earlier information was influenced by both age and sex factors as indicated by the forced-choice paradigm findings. The present findings demonstrating the earlier acquisition of spatial competencies of the females in comparison to males, could reflect differences in foraging strategies between sexes, and/or differences in the anatomo-physiological development of specific brain structures, and/or different modulating effects of sexual hormones. © 2009 ISDN.

These students have areas of remarkable talent but often have verbal learning difficulties that prevent them from being identified for gifted services as traditional assessments emphasize verbal and quantitative skills, not nonverbal expertise. The dwindling number of American students pursuing higher level degrees in mathematics and science, natural strength areas for students with spatial skills, emphasizes the reasons educators need to identify and encourage these students at an early age.    This exploratory correlational research investigated the practicality and effectiveness of identification tools intended to locate elementary children with spatial strengths. My Thinking Style (MTS), a self-report survey instrument, was developed for this research. The results of the survey, determined through one-on-one interviews with fourth grade students, were compared to performance on the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT ) and the block design subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV).    Performance on a measure of nonverbal ability, the NNAT, was not related to visual-spatial ability as measured by the block design subtest of the WISC-IV Performance on the block design subtest was statistically significantly related to learning style preference as indicated on MTS. There was not a significant relationship between the MTS and the NNAT. The block design subtest of the WISC-IV has been shown to identify students with spatial strengths. The Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test may not be effective in identifying children with spatial strengths, while the self-report instrument, My Thinking Style has potential to do so. The block design must be administered individually to students by a licensed professional, while MTS has the potential for quick and simple administration by any educator.

The second goal was to study the effects of two secondary tasks (one visual and one auditory) on writing words of especial orthographic difficulty. In the study, 178 second and fifth grade school children performed a writing task under one of the following experimental conditions: control, articulatory suppression, mental rotation or double task. Each participant wrote the same series of words under three modes of presentation. The first presentation was auditory, the second was visual, and the third was auditory. The results suggest the implication of working memory in learning to write and the effectiveness of visual presentations. The study also shows the gradual development of orthographic lexicon in children. Copyright © 2003 Psicothema.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		3	1	0	1	1	0	0	1

Metabolism: clinical and experimental	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2008.07.010	Experimental studies in animals indicate that androgen exposure in fetal or neonatal life largely accounts for known sex differences in brain structure and behavior.  Clinical research in humans suggests similar influences of early androgen  concentrations on some behaviors that show sex differences, including play behavior  in childhood and sexual orientation in adulthood. Available research also suggests  that sex steroid hormone exposure may contribute to sex differences in the risk of  autism and affective disorders in schizophrenia. However, findings have been  inconsistent for other characteristics that show sex differences, including  aggression and spatial ability. Moreover, social and environmental factors may  modulate some of the associations observed. This article reviews the evidence that  early-life exposure to sex steroid hormones contributes to sexually dimorphic  behavior and cognitive abilities in humans.

Maximum likelihood estimation via LISREL 8 was used to conduct confirmatory factor analyses using the covariance matrix of age-based linear standard scores on each of the 12 Brigance subtests. The factors reported in the Brigance technical report, which serves as the model on which Brigance domain scores are obtained, did not fit the independent set of data. Rather, a competing three-factor model, based on 7 of the 12 Brigance subtests, measuring Rote Knowledge (Factor 1), Visual-Spatial Skills (Factor 2), and Comprehension (Factor 3), showed excellent fit to the data. Concurrent validity evidence indicated low to moderate associations when each factor was correlated with the cognitive processing subtests of the K-ABC. The predictive validity of the factors was investigated using teacher ratings, performance on standardized achievement tests, and special education placement. Predictive validity coefficients ranged from low to moderate. The results bring into question the use of this test with the Head Start population.

Indeed, the ability to use observations of brain activity as a channel of interaction is a goal of a number of research communities. Progress in robust brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) requires a number of specializations: brain function, recording techniques for brain activity, computational models of brain activity, feature selection and classification, and feedback mechanisms. Modern BMIs are the integration of these desiderata.    Today, there is a growing need for robust BMIs as an assistive technology. In 2005, it was estimated that 3.17 million Americans were currently living with disabilities resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) (102; 71). Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of disability in children and adults from ages 1 to 44 (1). Many of these people require alternative interaction technologies for both therapy and quality of life. People suffering from degenerative diseases are living longer and require more sophisticated interaction channels: fifty percent of people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) live at least three years after diagnosis, twenty percent at least five years, and ten percent at least ten years (39).   We make the following claim: Sparse regularization improves components analysis in noisy, overcomplete environments; a psychophysiological analysis of mental rotation shows its applicability to BMIs. The combination of these approaches enables more robust BMI. This dissertation is an explanation and elaboration of these concepts and serves as evidence for our claims.   Current research in brain-machine interfaces is progressing from answering questions of effectiveness to questions of efficiency: what brain-machine interface (BMI) approaches facilitate robust interaction? Currently, robust interaction with BMIs is limited by problems of initiating and stopping interaction as well as the presence of artifacts and noise in sensor data. Increased efficiency for BMIs means greater accessibility for different populations. For the disabled population, more ways of indicating intention means greater accessibility for a greater range of impairments. For the general population, new methods of interaction allow for tighter, closed-loop biofeedback mechanisms, with applications such as simple desktop task control, game interaction, and remote robotic control.   Portable sensing arrays such as electroencephalography (EEG) are commonly used for applying neural signals to near real-time control tasks, because they offer minimally invasive sensing arrays for observing neural activity. EEG is particularly able to observe electrical activity of neural cells in response to stimuli with good temporal resolution. These event related potentials (ERPs) are the target signals used by BMIs, and one objective of ERP inference is to be able to identify target activity of a single trial. However, EEG is spatially sparse and sensitive to electrical noise, therefore robust inference requires effective methods for removing artifacts and segmenting target signals. Being able to factor noise artifacts allows us to recover features that better represent the underlying functional processes within the brain.  The primary objective of this work is to improve signal classification of ERP data by improving noise factoring methods and by discovering novel ERP patterns.

Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies	https://doi.org/10.1111/infa.12284	Early in development, children explore and combine objects in increasingly complex ways. One manual skill, object construction, represents a major shift in how objects  are explored relative to other objects. Despite recent connections with cognitive  functioning such as spatial skills, the development of object construction ability  has rarely been studied and its trajectory has not been adequately described. The  purpose of this study was to describe the development of three types of object  construction (stacking, nesting, affixing) across 5 monthly infant visits and 7  monthly toddler visits using a longitudinal design and a large sample size. Infants  (10-14 months, n=131) and toddlers drawn from the infant sample (18-24 months, n=65)  were given sets of age-appropriate toys each of which elicited at least one type of  constructive play. We described success at different construction tasks and  identified trends for construction skill for infant and toddler development using  multilevel modeling. We found that each of the three construction actions developed  in unique ways across the 10-24-month period. Infant construction skill predicted  the development of toddler skill, but toddler construction skill diverged from  infant trajectories. We discuss the role of combination strategies in the  development of object construction skill and how object construction could be  related to other domains of development.

In a first study, selected groups of children, with high and low visuospatial ability were asked to learn pathways on the basis of films of streets of an Italian town. Only some of the films offered referential continuity between streets, which could help in the construction of spatial mental models. Furthermore, high visuospatial ability were required in representing the pathways. In a second study young adults were administered the same task in association with a spatial task expected to interfere with spatial working memory and an articulatory task expected to interfere with verbal working memory. High spatial ability subjects were better in a pointing task requiring to point to predefined targets and were affected by a selective visuospatial interference effect. Results show that visuospatial differences influence the ability to generate spatial mental models and the specificity of the activated processes. © 2000 Franco Angeli Edizioni. All rights reserved.

A group of graves is scattered in or near the urban perimeter, while, at the same time, the vast majority of the inhabitants of the city are buried in the large necropolis of the river, and while the physiognomy of the city itself shows rapid and drastic changes. This apparent anomaly can be explained only by the complete re-examination of the data available. Beyond the example of Smyrna, we came to the conclusion that the organizing principles of funerary space in archaic Greek poleis doesn't always follow a linear evolution but probably obeys to historical and social factors that alternatively create periods of stability and instability in the geographical distribution of the graves.

Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2008.10.010	INTRODUCTION: Foreign Accent Syndrome (FAS) is a relatively rare motor speech disorder in which the pronunciation of a patient is perceived by listeners of the  same language community as distinctly foreign. FAS has been well documented in adult  patients with etiologically heterogeneous, though mostly vascular brain lesions  affecting the motor speech network of the language dominant hemisphere. In addition,  reports exist of adult patients in whom FAS was due to a psychiatric illness.  Although FAS has been reported in children, such accounts are rare and have remained  largely anecdotal in that there have been no formally documented cases of FAS as a  developmental motor speech disorder. METHODS AND RESULTS: For the first time, we  describe the clinical, cognitive and neurolinguistic findings in two patients who in  the absence of a history of psychiatric illness or acquired brain damage already  presented with FAS at an early stage of speech and language development. In the  first patient "developmental FAS" was associated with a dysharmonic distribution of  neurocognitive test results indicating slight underdevelopment of visuo-spatial  skills and visual memory. The second patient presented with "developmental FAS"  associated with specific language impairment (SLI). Independent support for a  diagnosis of FAS in both patients was obtained in an accent attribution experiment  in which groups of native speakers of (Belgian) Dutch assessed the type of foreign  accent of a sample of the patients' conversational speech. Both patients were judged  as non-native speakers of Dutch by the majority of participants who predominantly  identified the accent as French. CONCLUSION: This paper for the first time documents  two patients who presented with FAS on a developmental basis. The finding that FAS  does not only occur in the context of acquired brain damage or psychogenic illness  but also exists as developmental motor speech impairment requires a re-definition of  FAS as a clinical syndrome.

Conf. Humanoid Robots, HUMANOIDS	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHR.2009.5379555	Human Robot Interaction brings new challenges to the geometric reasoning and space sharing. The robot should not only reason on its own capacities but also consider the actual situation by looking from human's eyes, thus "putting itself to human's perspective". In humans, the "visual perspective taking" ability begins to appear by 24 months of age and is used to determine if another person can see an object or not. In this paper, we present a geometric reasoning mechanism that employs psychological concepts of "perspective taking" and "mental rotation" in order to reason what the human sees, what the robot sees and where the robot should focus to share human's attention. This geometric reasoning mechanism is demonstrated with HRP-2 humanoid robot in a human-robot face-to-face interaction context. ©2009 IEEE.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

This study aims to describe in detail the narrative abilities of a group of 9 WS participants who underwent careful cognitive evaluation to assess their visual-spatial abilities, sustained attention, phonological short-term memory and lexical as well as grammatical skills in tests of expressive and receptive language. Furthermore, they performed a picture-description task in order to elicit more fluid and communicative speech samples, which were then compared with those provided by a group of 29 children with typically developing language (TD) matched for mental age. The WS participants showed visual-spatial deficits but scored within the normal range, according to their mental age, in the linguistic assessment. For the narrative task, they showed good phonological, lexical and syntactic skills, but their story descriptions were less effective than those produced by the TD group on measures assessing global coherence and lexical informativeness, showing dissociation between macro and microlinguistic abilities. These impairments were not correlated to the visual-spatial disturbances. These data suggest that the domain of discourse processing is a relative weakness in WS individuals. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The sample included 58 children from 2;6 to 6 years old and their parents. The parent-child dyads were videotaped in the home setting during a 30-minute interactive play period with both structured and unstructured toys, chosen by the researchers. The interactive play was analysed using the Scale for Observing Child-Adult Play [Marjanovič-Umek, L., & Fekonja-Peklaj, U. (2012). Lestvica za opazovanje otroka in starša med igro [Scale for Observing Child-Adult Play]. Ljubljana: Oddelek za psihologijo, Filozofska fakulteta], which consists of five categories for assessing the adult's play and four categories for assessing the child's play. The results obtained showed positive correlations between parents' and children's play behaviour. The regression analysis showed that the parental use of mental transformations was the strongest predictor of a child's play behaviour; namely, the development of the play content and play frame as well as the child's use of mental transformations. The findings provide important possible implications, especially in the sense of scaffolding children's symbolic play. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

Earlier born children tended to have higher verbal and number ability scores, but ordinal position was not related to reasoning and spatial abilities. When social status differences between the families were statistically controlled, the birth order differences in the verbal and number abilities remained significant. However, the birth order differences in the abilities were accounted for when variations in the family environments were controlled. The results provide support for the proposition that families establish different environmental experiences for children of differing ordinal positions and that the experiences are related to variations in mental ability scores. © 1975 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The boys parents were then given the environment interview. It was found that the environment measure accounted for a large percentage of the variance in verbal, number, and total ability scores, and a moderate percentage of the variance in reasoning ability scores. For spatial ability the relationship with the environment was less definite.

Journal of the neurological sciences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2014.05.032	Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) has been recently identified as a target of humoral autoimmunity in a small subgroup of patients with non-paraneoplastic limbic  encephalitis (NPLE). We present a patient with NPLE and positive anti-GAD antibodies  who showed significant improvement after long-term immunotherapy. A 48-year old  female was admitted with a two-year history of anterograde amnesia and seizures.  Brain MRI revealed bilateral lesions of medial temporal lobes. Screening for  anti-neuronal antibodies showed high anti-GAD titers in both serum and cerebrospinal  fluid (CSF) with strong evidence of intrathecal production. The patient received  treatment with prednisolone and long-term plasma exchange.

database	Markey, Sean M.	2009	thesis	The relationship between visual -spatial reasoning ability and math and geometry problem-solving		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/relationship-between-visual-spatial-reasoning/docview/305131299/se-2?accountid=11531	This retrospective quantitative study examined the relationship between visual-spatial reasoning abilities, as measured by the matrix reasoning and block design subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), and geometry and math performance, as measured by geometry and overall math scores from the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS). Recent research in the field of math disability (MD) has sought to more clearly define the various, distinct cognitive profiles of students with MD. This has required an examination of the separate types of math problems that students face in the classroom, as well as an examination of the various cognitive abilities that underlie these separate groups of math problems. Several researchers have identified three areas of difficulty which could each lead to MD, including, mastering and recalling basic number facts (number sense), language impairments, and visual-spatial difficulties (Garnett, 1998; Geary, 2004; National Center for Learning Disabilities, 2006; Wright, 1996). Other researchers, including Kovas, Petril, and Plomin (2007), have identified five distinct mathematical domains: mathematical applications, understanding numbers, computation and knowledge, mathematical interpretation, and non-numerical processes. Students with MD tend to struggle with one or more of these domains. The present study helps to isolate impaired visual-spatial reasoning ability as an underlying cause of MD in students who struggle with geometry in particular, and math in general. Subjects were 31 middle school students from a public school in western Massachusetts, approximately 50% male and 50% female. It was predicted that lower matrix reasoning (MR) and block design (BD) scores would predict lower scores on MCAS geometry and MCAS math. A Pearson r revealed a significant positive correlation (.479) between BD scores and MCAS math scores, a significant positive correlation (.373) between MR scores and MCAS geometry scores, and a significant positive correlation (.479) between combined WISC-IV subtest scores (MR+BD) and MCAS math scores. An independent groups T-ratio revealed no significant relationship between the MCAS math or MCAS geometry scores of three groups of participants; those who scored below the mean on one, both, or neither of the WISC-IV subtests. A Spearman r revealed significant positive correlations between participants' block design rank and MCAS math rank (.431), between MR rank and MCAS geometry rank (.369), and between participants' combined WISC-IV subtest score rank (BD plus MR) and their rank-ordered MCAS math results (.423). The data implicate visual-spatial ability as a factor underlying success in math and geometry.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Developmental Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.13.4.320	Attempted to determine (a) whether 4- and 5-yr-old children can evoke and use kinetic imagery (measured via mental rotation procedures) and (b) whether the ability to use kinetic imagery depends on the attainment of concrete operations (measured via a test of number conservation). To test kinetic imagery ability, 24 4-yr-olds and 24 5-yr-olds were asked to make same–different judgments on pairs of forms that differed in angular orientation. Half of the Ss had been trained to rotate one form into congruence with the other to make judging easier, while the other half had not been given training. It was hypothesized that if children of this age both use and evoke kinetic imagery, then both the trained and untrained Ss should yield the linear trends in reaction time indicative of kinetic imagery. If children can use but not evoke kinetic imagery, it was expected that the trained Ss would yield these linear trends while the untrained children would not. Results show that 4- and 5-yr-olds used and evoked kinetic imagery. Their performance was compared to that of a group of 24 adults. 26 of the children also were given a test of number conservation. Results yield no evidence of association between kinetic imagery and conservation, suggesting that the ability to use kinetic imagery does not depend on the attainment of concrete operations.

Cognitive Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0285(75)90022-5	An experiment investigated at what age children could represent movement in imagery. Five- and eight-year olds were asked whether two stimuli were the same or different in shape. The two stimuli were either presented in the same orientation or one stimulus differed from the other by clockwise rotation of 30 ° (0.52 rad), 60 ° (1.05 rad), 120 ° (2.09 rad), or 150 ° (2.62 rad). Children were instructed to visually imagine the counterclockwise rotation of one shape into the position of the other to help make the judgment. For both 5- and 8-yr olds, reaction times increased as a linear function of angular discrepancy between stimuli, indicating that both age groups represented rotation in their imagery. The findings conflict with Piaget and Inhelder's thesis that imagery representing movement first emerges when children are 7 to 8 yrs of age.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frequently, evaluations will include diagnostic observation schedules or rating scales, including use of Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2) or Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). These tools can be informative in determining whether or not a child meets criteria for an autism spectrum disorder. However, children with ASD often exhibit many other areas of concern outside of social reasoning and repetitive behavior that can provide valuable information when determining treatment protocols. Deficits are frequently seen in executive functioning, visual-spatial skills, language, auditory processing, attention, and emotional regulation. This chapter will examine the research and discuss common functional deficits in these other areas that can help clinicians better understand their clients and their individual needs. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

In an attempt to provide such information, the neuropsychological and psychosocial functioning of a group of 17 children with hydrocephalus between the ages of eight and fourteen years old was investigated. Performance by the sample with hydrocephalus was compared to that of a ‘normal’ control sample. Participants with hydrocephalus and control participants were matched on the variables of sex, age, years of education, and socio-economic status. Relative to control participants, the participants with hydrocephalus were impaired on measures of intellectual, attention, verbal and visual memory, and visuo-spatial abilities. Language alone was relatively preserved. The children with hydrocephalus also exhibited poorer self-esteem, fewer adaptive competencies, and more problem behaviours than the ‘normal’ controls. For the children with hydrocephalus, the relationship between their impaired intellectual abilities and their psychosocial functioning was investigated. © 1996, Cambridge University Press.

Journal of deaf studies and deaf education	https://doi.org/10.1093/deafed/enl004	Spatial relations in American Sign Language (ASL) are often signed from the perspective of the signer and so involve a shift in perspective and mental rotation.  This study examined developing knowledge of language used to refer to the spatial  relations front, behind, left, right, towards, away, above, and below by children  learning ASL and English. Because ASL is a classifier language in which noun  referents are placed into groups, each spatial relation also appeared with person,  animal, and vehicle classifiers. Twenty-three children and adults who learned ASL  before the age of 5 years and 23 native English-speaking adults and children  participated. Both language groups participated in a comprehension task in which  they chose which of 2 pictures depicted a signed or spoken relation. Results showed  that children learning ASL acquired the constructions for spatial relations that  typically involve perspective shifts and mental rotation later than constructions  that do not involve these abilities and later than English-speaking children.  Children learning ASL did not differ from English-speaking children in learning  constructions that did not involve these abilities. Results also suggest that users  of ASL initially comprehend spatial relations more accurately with person and animal  classifiers than with the classifier for vehicles. The results are relevant to  understanding the acquisition of spatial relations in ASL.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Background: Interlocking building toys and models are increasingly prevalent and important for developing spatial abilities and fine motor skills among children. Little is known about how effectively the intended child users can interpret and carry out the instructions. Method: Twenty-four children used five sets of manufacturer-supplied pictorial toy assembly instructions. We evaluated the impact of toy instruction set, age, gender, and previous experience on usability problems, assembly speed and accuracy, instruction gaze time, and subjective ratings. Results: The children had difficulty with all but the simplest instructions and assemblies. As predicted, older participants assembled more quickly, with fewer errors and fewer instruction looks. However, the 6-year-old girls assembled the fewest parts correctly, and the 9-year-old girls reported having the least fun. Instruction look time and frequency revealed differences in instruction complexity and were correlated with subjective ratings of fun. Thirty-two usability problems were observed, and 10 are described in detail. Conclusion: Product age recommendations may not reflect developmentally appropriate instructions. Small design changes should contribute to improved instruction usability among young children. For instance, designers should avoid complex graphic syntax, depict colors accurately, select clear angles of view, and support natural tendencies to assemble top to bottom. Application: This research provides pictorial assembly instruction guidelines to inform instruction designers and describes performance and look-time benchmarks for future usability studies.

Journal of affective disorders	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2018.09.009	BACKGROUND: The effect of childhood maltreatment (CM) on neuropsychological performance is well established, but the effect of anxiety proneness (AP) on such  performance has been underexplored. We assessed the predictive ability of CM and AP,  and their interaction, in non-clinical adolescents, for a range of previously  documented neuropsychological deficits. METHODS: Multiple linear regression models  were used to assess the unique and combined influences of CM and AP on  neuropsychological performance in 104 non-clinical adolescents, who underwent both  neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. RESULTS: The interaction of CM  and AP was associated with poorer performance in executive functioning skills,  processing speed, and estimated IQ. CM and AP were uniquely associated with verbal  working memory performance, while verbal and visual memory performance and learning,  and visuo-spatial ability, were not associated with either CM, AP or the interaction  of CM and AP. LIMITATIONS: The use of self-report measures to determine  participants' levels of CM, AP, and depression. The CTQ-SF, a retrospective  self-report measure, may have introduced recall bias. The neuropsychological  evaluation was not conducted in the Xhosa language, the first language of most  African participants. Most instruments utilized have not been validated in a South  African adolescent sample. The impact of important moderator variables (e.g., age of  onset of maltreatment) was not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of CM and AP  may be risk markers for poor performance in several key neuropsychological domains.  Our findings underscore the importance of assessing the impact of both CM and  anxiety-related temperamental traits on neuropsychological performance.

The etiology was vascular in 14 cases, traumatic in 10, infectious in 4 and tumoral in one. Twelve children (41.4%) had a calculation disturbance (a score below the 10th percentile for school grade). Acalculia was associated with aphasia and with low scores on reading and writing tests. It was also significantly more frequent in children who had repeated school grades before the onset of illness. Calculation difficulties were more common in cases with cortical involvement of the left hemisphere, but were not linked to any specific localization. While previous reports have stressed the role of visuo-spatial abilities in arithmetic acquisition in pre-schoolers, this study shows that language is essential for calculation abilities in school age children.

Recently we also demonstrated that, in the absence of vision, auditory feedback of body movements can enhance spatial perception in visually impaired adults and children. In the present study, we assessed whether sighted adults can also improve their spatial abilities related to shape recognition with an audio-motor training based on the idea that the coupling of auditory and motor information can further refine the representation of space when vision is missing. Auditory shape recognition was assessed in 22 blindfolded sighted adults with an auditory task requiring participants to identify four shapes by means of the sound conveyed through a set of consecutive loudspeakers embedded on a fixed two-dimensional vertical array. We divided participants into two groups of 11 adults each, performing a training session in two different modalities: active audio-motor training (experimental group) and passive auditory training (control group). The audio-motor training consisted in the reproduction of specific movements with the arm by relying on the sound produced by an auditory source positioned on the wrist of participants. Results showed that sighted individuals improved the recognition of auditory shapes only after active training, suggesting that audio-motor feedback can be an effective tool to enhance spatial representation when visual information is lacking.

Neurotoxicology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuro.2012.08.001	BACKGROUND: Resin-based dental restorations may intra-orally release their components and bisphenol A. Gestational bisphenol A exposure has been associated  with poorer executive functioning in children. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether  exposure to resin-based composite restorations is associated with neuropsychological  development in children. METHODS: Secondary analysis of treatment level data from  the New England Children's Amalgam Trial, a 2-group randomized safety trial  conducted from 1997 to 2006. Children (N=534) aged 6-10 y with ≥2 posterior tooth  caries were randomized to treatment with amalgam or resin-based composites  (bisphenol-A-diglycidyl-dimethacrylate-composite for permanent teeth; urethane  dimethacrylate-based polyacid-modified compomer for primary teeth).  Neuropsychological function at 4- and 5-year follow-up (N=444) was measured by a  battery of tests of executive function, intelligence, memory, visual-spatial skills,  verbal fluency, and problem-solving. Multivariable generalized linear regression  models were used to examine the association between composite exposure levels and  changes in neuropsychological test scores from baseline to follow-up. For  comparison, data on children randomized to amalgam treatment were similarly  analyzed. RESULTS: With greater exposure to either dental composite material,  results were generally consistent in the direction of slightly poorer changes in  tests of intelligence, achievement or memory, but there were no statistically  significant associations. For the four primary measures of executive function,  scores were slightly worse with greater total composite exposure, but statistically  significant only for the test of Letter Fluency (10-surface-years β=-0.8, SE=0.4,  P=0.035), and the subtest of color naming (β=-1.5, SE=0.5, P=0.004) in the Stroop  Color-Word Interference Test. Multivariate analysis of variance confirmed that the  negative associations between composite level and executive function were not  statistically significant (MANOVA, P=0.18). Results for greater amalgam exposure  were mostly nonsignificant in the opposite direction of slightly improved scores  over follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Dental composite restorations had statistically  insignificant associations of small magnitude with impairments in neuropsychological  test change scores over 4- or 5-years of follow-up in this trial.

Infants were familiarized to an object either from a single viewpoint or from multiple viewpoints varying in rotation around a single axis. Object recognition was then tested in both conditions with the same object rotated around a novel axis. Infants in the multiple-views condition recognized the object, whereas infants in the single-view condition provided no evidence for recognition. Under the same 2 familiarization conditions, infants in a 2nd experiment treated as novel an object that differed in only 1 component from the familiar object. Infants' object recognition is enhanced by experience with multiple views, even when that experience is around an orthogonal axis of rotation, and infants are sensitive to even subtle shape differences between components of similar objects. In general, infants' performance does not accord with the predictions of the IFV model of object recognition. These findings motivate the extension of future research and theory beyond the limits of strictly interpolative mechanisms.

Materials and methods: A total of 24 young female athletes (Age: mean, m= 11.47 year; ± 0.61 Standard Deviation, SD; Height: m=143.75 centimeters, ± 6.13SD; Weight: m=39.22 kilograms, ± 3.83SD)practicing team water sports at a competitive level from at least one year participated in the research; 11 of them were part of a synchronized swimming team and 13 of a water polo squad. To carry out the present study, in order to assess personality, self-esteem, mood and visual-spatial skills of sample, the following psychological assessment tests were used: 1) Big Five Questionnaire for Children, 2) Multidimensional Self-esteem Test, 3) Profile of Mood States - Adolescent, and 4) Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test.The study was performed at the sports center "Torre del Grifo Village" (Mascalucia, Italy). Results: The study has showed, in both groups of athletes, the presence of personological features oriented to establish friendly and cooperative relations; what it makes us conclude that within the two teams there are positive relationships between athletes, also aimed at achieving the common goal, and that the group component is crucial. It is also seen that in the synchronized swimming team the individual dimension emerges strongly, in terms of athletic competition spirit. Conclusion: The comparison between the two groups showed that the water polo seems to encourage the development of visual-spatial skills, compared to synchronized swimmers.It is due to better performance in the memory copy of Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, by the water polo athletes.

We studied the relation between EEG paroxysms and visuo-spatial abilities (Gestalt Bender Test = GBT) in 72 children (37 males, 35 females; age 6-12 years, mean 10.5 yrs) with epilepsy (52 generalized, 20 partial). The EEG was monitored on magnetic tape by a 9-channel ambulatory EEG system, during the test. Normative data of GBT were obtained by a control group. EEG epileptiform abnormalities recorded during the test were as the followings: 31 generalized paroxysms, 18 right foci, 11 left foci, 12 no paroxysms. A significantly lower IQ at GBT was found in all EEG groups compared with the mean IQ control group; lowest values were obtained in patients with right foci and generalized paroxysms.

The sample constituted 166 children aged between 6 and 11 from a surburban school. Each child was asked to draw a map of their journey to school and home area. Three different methods of stimulus presentation were used: free-recall sketching and the interpretation of either a large scale plan or an aerial photograph. A structured interview with every individual provided information on home range behaviour. The study confirms a growing differential between the activity spaces of boys and girls within their home area during early childhood. Discernible sex-differences are revealed in both the quantitative accretion of environmental knowledge and in the qualitative manner that children are able to externalize their mental imagery. Contrasts first appear around the middle years of early schooling at a time when boys begin to enjoy greater parental granted rights within their locality. By the age of 11 boys were able to draw maps broader in conception and more detailed in content than correspondingly aged girls. -from Author	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The population was divided to form two groups (A and B) of similar sex composition and environmental experience. The children were informed that the aim of the project was to construct a map of an unfamiliar area which they were to visit. The two groups were ‘primed’ about their task in different ways, with children in Group B undertaking a slightly more complex exercise. The results show that whilst ‘priming’ has the effect of reducing disjunction between the spatial capabilities of boys and girls on simpler tasks, when the exercise is complicated boys do much better than girls in all but one of the spatial assessments. Such evidence lends further support to those who argue that the more extensive movements of boys through the environment leads to superior spatial ability. The educational implications of the results are considered. © 1987, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

No unified means of examining spatial ability has been attempted by investigators. The focus of this research is thus based on the integration of developmental predictions with a processing model created to generate and test hypotheses regarding certain spatial competencies of young children. Of primary interest was how young children perform depending on the dimensionality of the spatial materials utilized in the experimental task. One hundred and sixty 4 and 6 year old children were randomly selected for one of four treatment conditions with age and sex distributed equally in each condition. Spatial materials were presented in either two or three dimensions and subjects were required to judge whether a response item also presented in two or three dimensions matched the stimulus display. Across-versus within-dimensional performance was therefore compared in a single study. Five displays were presented ranging in difficulty from simple to complex. Response materials consisted of a correct match on the stimulus item and four error types. Types of errors included a geometric violation (in which the objects in the display were unconnected at one point), a depth violation (lack of the depth dimension), a 90(DEGREES) or 270(DEGREES) rotation violation and a 180(DEGREES) violation. These last two violations were considered orientation errors similar to those children exhibit on perspective-taking tasks. Three separate analyses of variance were performed on the data. Results from each of these analyses indicated that six year old children significantly outperformed four year olds in all conditions. However, of importance to developmental psychology was the finding that all subjects performed as well as they did on a task thought to be quite difficult. Also reiterated in these analyses was the result that within-dimensional performance was significantly better than across-dimensional ability for all subjects. Analysis of display complexity revealed that there was differential success for the subjects based on the complexity of the display. Errors analysis indicated that the rotation and reflection foils created the most difficulty for subjects. This finding was reiterated in the Age X Foil Type interaction and Sex X Stimulus Dimension X Response Dimension X Foil Type interaction, in which four year olds’ relative inability to perform on these errors as compared to six year olds was shown. This suggests that the ability to correctly discriminate orientation occurs late in the developmental sequence. While no main effect for sex was indicated by any of the analyses, there was an interesting finding as a result of the Sex X Stimulus Dimension X Response Dimension X Foil Type interaction. When across-dimension performance was examined, it was found that males made relatively more errors of an orientation type than females, exhibiting a possible lack of attention to the provided facilitative reference frame. Results were further discussed in terms of predictions from the hypothetical model and in regard to developmental issues. Limitations of the work were also discussed.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.03054	During the last years, digital writing devices are increasingly replacing handwriting with pencil and paper. As reading and writing skills are central for  education, it is important to know, which writing tool is optimal for initial  literacy education. The present training study was therefore set up to test the  influence of the writing tool on the acquisition of literacy skills at the letter  and word level with various tests in a large sample of kindergarten children (n =  147). Using closely matched letter learning games, children were trained with 16  letters by handwriting with a pencil on a sheet of paper, by writing with a stylus  on a tablet computer, or by typing letters using a virtual keyboard on a tablet  across 7 weeks. Training using a stylus on a touchscreen is an interesting  comparison condition for traditional handwriting, because the slippery surface of a  touchscreen has lower friction than paper and thus increases difficulty of motor  control. Before training, immediately after training and four to five weeks after  training, we assessed reading and writing performance using standardized tests. We  also assessed visuo-spatial skills before and after training, in order to test,  whether the different training regimens affected cognitive domains other than  written language. Children of the pencil group showed superior performance in letter  recognition and improved visuo-spatial skills compared with keyboard training. The  performance of the stylus group did not differ significantly neither from the  keyboard nor from the pencil group. Keyboard training, however, resulted in superior  performance in word writing and reading compared with handwriting training with a  stylus on the tablet, but not compared with the pencil group. Our results suggest  that handwriting with pencil fosters acquisition of letter knowledge and improves  visuo-spatial skills compared with keyboarding. At least given the current  technological state, writing with a stylus on a touchscreen seems to be the least  favorable writing tool, possibly because of increased demands on motor control.  Future training studies covering a more extended observation period over years are  needed to allow conclusions about long-term effects of writing tools on literacy  acquisition as well as on general cognitive development.

One hundred fifty-five fourth graders were tested on 20 recently developed paper-and-pencil items tapping four different components of scientific reasoning (understanding the nature of science, understanding theories, designing experiments, and interpreting data). As confirmed by Rasch analyses, the scientific reasoning items formed a reliable scale. Model comparisons differentiated scientific reasoning as a separate construct from measures of intelligence and reading skills and revealed discriminant validity. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between scientific reasoning and the postulated prerequisites inhibitory control, spatial abilities and problem-solving skills. As shown by correlation and regression analyses, beside general cognitive abilities (intelligence, reading skills) problem-solving skills and spatial abilities predicted performance in scientific reasoning items and thus contributed to explaining individual differences in elementary school children's scientific reasoning competencies. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

database	Mazur, T.; Clopper, R. R.	1991	journalArticle	Pubertal disorders. Psychology and clinical management.	Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America		The behavioral data reviewed herein must be viewed with caution. Although there are reports that adhere to rigorous methodology, these are the exception. Most reports  do not adequately describe either the methodology used or their sample. Subjects are  often of mixed endocrine diagnoses, and sometimes the results are of both boys and  girls. All of these pitfalls make interpretation of results difficult and limiting.  With this in mind, the following conclusions are offered. The majority of behavioral  data on precocious puberty comes from studies of IPP in girls. Cognitively, IPP has  been associated with average to high-average intelligence. Purportedly, the finding  of lower visual-spatial skills than verbal skills in early maturing boys and girls  has received equivocal support by cognitive studies of IPP individuals. Similarly,  clear differences in hemispheric lateralization have not been demonstrated. Aside  from increased somatic complaints during the nonmenstrual phases of their menstrual  cycle, girls with IPP show a spectrum of behavior adjustments. Major psychopathology  is rare. Clearly, their early development makes them look older than their actual  age, which probably alters the expectations others have for them. Psychosexually,  however, IPP girls develop in concert with their chronologic age and social  experience, rather than their early biologic maturation. However, recent reports  suggest a modest influence of hormones. In summary, these studies support an  interactionist theory of human psychosexual development. Research data on IPP girls  suggest that they do not significantly differ from girls who are early maturers but  within the normal range. Research on these girls indicates that most negotiate their  puberty without severe problems. There has been less research on IPP boys because it  occurs so rarely. Most of what is understood about precocious puberty in boys comes  from boys with precocious puberty secondary to poorly controlled CAH. Behavioral  data on individuals with delayed puberty come almost exclusively from boys. Although  CD appears to be the most frequently diagnosed form of delayed puberty and does not  reflect a known pathologic process, men with CD as well as those with organic  disorders appear to be at risk for psychosocial and psychosexual difficulties. These  difficulties are not severe forms of psychopathology. Rather, they probably  represent problems negotiating the expected adolescent lessons of psychosocial  development with a physique that places them at a disadvantage. They clearly look  younger than their actual chronologic age. Cognitively, as with the children with  precocious puberty, there is no evidence of intellectual impairment associated with  delayed puberty.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)	https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11040718	BACKGROUND: Periodic circadian protein homolog 2 (PER2) has a role in the intracellular signaling pathways of long-term potentiation and has implications for  synaptic plasticity. We aimed to assess the association of PER2 C111G polymorphism  with cognitive functions in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). METHODS: Forty-five  SCD patients were included in this study. All participants underwent extensive  neuropsychological investigation, analysis of apolipoprotein E (APOE) and PER2  genotypes, and neuropsychological follow-up every 12 or 24 months for a mean time of  9.87 ± 4.38 years. RESULTS: Nine out of 45 patients (20%) were heterozygous carriers  of the PER2 C111G polymorphism (G carriers), while 36 patients (80%) were not  carriers of the G allele (G non-carriers). At baseline, G carriers had a higher  language composite score compared to G non-carriers. During follow-up, 15 (34.88%)  patients progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In this group, we found a  significant interaction between PER2 G allele and follow-up time, as carriers of G  allele showed greater worsening of executive function, visual-spatial ability, and  language composite scores compared to G non-carriers. CONCLUSIONS: PER2 C111G  polymorphism is associated with better language performance in SCD patients.  Nevertheless, as patients progress to MCI, G allele carriers showed a greater  worsening in cognitive performance compared to G non-carriers. The effect of PER2  C111G polymorphism depends on the global cognitive status of patients.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

It is characterized by short stature, cardioskeletal myopathy, cyclic neutropenia, increased excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid in the urine, and moderate hypocholesterolemia. The objective of the present study was to assess whether BTHS presents with a cognitive phenotype. Preliminary data were collected from five kindergarten or first-grade boys with BTHS. An abbreviated psychoeducational test battery was administered to each boy, and parents of each boy completed standardized behavior rating scales. Data from 120 boys of similar age or grade level were used for one comparison group; a subset of this sample comprised a comparison group that was individually matched on age and grade level to one of the five boys with BTHS. Preliminary data reflect a higher incidence of cognitive difficulties in boys with BTHS relative to both comparison groups. Boys with BTHS had significantly lower visual spatial skills, but comparable reading-related skills, when compared with either group. Although based on a small sample size, the preliminary data presented in this work are the first indication of a cognitive phenotype associated with BTHS. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Annals of dyslexia	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11881-003-0011-7	This paper is a descriptive report of findings from a prospective longitudinal study of math disability (MD). The study was designed to address the incidence of MD  during primary school, the utility of different MD definitions, and evidence of MD  subtypes. The results illustrate the dynamic properties of psychometrically derived  definitions of MD. Different groups of children meet criteria for MD depending on  which measure(s) are used for identification. Over time, a given individual may not  continue to meet MD criteria, even when using the same assessments. Thus, the  findings lead to cautions regarding the single-tool/ one-time assessment for a  clinical diagnosis of MD. Twenty-two of 209 participants demonstrated "persistent  MD" (MD-p), or MD for more than one school grade. Reading disability was relatively  more frequent in this MD-p subgroup than in the remaining participants (25 percent  vs. 7 percent). Reading-related skills were correlated with math achievement, as  were select visual spatial skills. There was minimal overlap between groups who met  either a "poor achievement" criteria or an "IQ-achievement discrepancy," and the  latter was far less stable a measure over time than the former. The results  highlight the complexities of defining MD and illustrate the need for more research  in this area.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Across groups, the strongest predictor of reading itself was phonological awareness; visual processing did not predict reading. For both groups, speed of processing strongly predicted speeded naming, visual processing, and phonological awareness. Despite diversities of culture, language, and orthography to be learned, models of early reading development were remarkably similar across cultures and first and second language orthographies. © 2002 by the Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

The results were correlated with IQ, vocabulary, verbal judgement and reasoning, and a spatial test with assessment in art and crafts. Unexpectedly high and significant correlations were yielded between drawing solids and cognitive tests involving verbal ability, when compared with correlations between solids, the spatial test and craft subjects, especially for the 12+ group. This appeared contrary to received views on the association of aptitude in drawing with spatial ability. Furthermore, as spatial factors are considered to underpin drawing and craft subjects, a closer association between these, rather than between drawing and verbal ability, was expected. This outcome raised certain theoretical questions concerning drawing and its interaction with perception, language, memory and intellectual development. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The objective of this study is to investigate whether virtual reality (VR) can assist children in transferring spatial learning to a real environment. Children (six and seven-yr-old participants) were asked to find ten objects hidden around a room and to try not to visit the same location more than once. Examination of the percentage of correct choices and the visit of first error showed improvement as a result of training. There were initial differences between children trained on the computer compared to those trained in the real environment. However, after three practice trials, children with the VR training were comparable to children trained in the real space. The implications for utilizing a VR environment for enhancing spatial abilities for children with mobility difficulties is discussed.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

For a representative national sample (N = 1,200) of children 5-17 years old, ability constructs (verbal, nonverbal, and spatial ability, and reading and numerical achievement) were assessed through the individually administered Differential Ability Scales. Adjustment constructs (attention-deficit hyperactive, solitary aggressive-provocative, solitary aggressive-impulsive, oppositional defiant, diffident, and avoidant) were assessed through teacher ratings with the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents. Partialled canonical redundancy and regression analyses revealed that 18.9% of ability variation (assuming control for chronological age and social adjustment) could be accounted for by demographics, particularly social class and ethnicity. Only 5.5% of the variability in adjustment (with control for varied ability) related to demographic factors, mainly gender and age. The results are discussed in the context of recent trends to advocate the use of separate norms and comparative assessments for distinct demographic groups. © 1995.

Based on their poor visual spatial skills and reported difficulties in social perception it was predicted that NLD children would be less lateralized with regards to nonverbal stimuli (emotional and musical) and more at risk for social problems and internalizing disorders than the VLD group. In the present study the expected left ear advantage (LEA) for nonverbal material was not found in any groups while a significant right ear advantage (REA) for verbal material was found in all but the VLD group. Contrary to predictions, NLD children demonstrated the highest lateralization scores for musical stimuli. No other significant differences in lateralization scores were found. With regards to behavior, a trend toward lower social skills was reported in NLD as compared to the control children. Reasons for the lack of expected ear advantages for nonverbal material and future directions for the study of social behavior in NLD children are discussed.

Hormones and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0018-506x(03)00014-x	Both otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) and the relative length of the index and ring fingers (the 2D:4D ratio) exhibit large sex differences, and both exhibit  masculinization effects in female homosexuals and bisexuals. Because these sex  differences exist in young children, the implication is that both types of measure  are affected by prenatal androgen exposure, but it has been unknown to what degree  these two types of measure are related. Accordingly, OAEs and the relative lengths  of the fingers and the toes were measured in 59 heterosexual females, 55  heterosexual males, 29 homosexual females, and 33 homosexual males. The correlations  between the two types of measure were unexpectedly quite low in both the  heterosexual and nonheterosexual groups. For example, the correlation between number  of spontaneous OAEs per ear and 2D:4D was less than 0.25, for both sexes and both  sexual orientations. One interpretation of these results is that the prenatal  hormonal mechanisms producing the sex differences in OAEs differ in quality, degree,  or timing from those producing the sex differences in relative finger length. That  is, OAEs and 2D:4D may be windows onto slightly different prenatal processes or  times during prenatal development. Measures of mental-rotation ability also were  obtained on these participants, and those correlations with relative finger length  also were small.

The aims of this study were 1. to determine whether functional connectivity abnormalities were associated with structural abnormalities of white matter (WM) in ASD and 2. to examine the relationships between aberrant neural connectivity and behaviour in ASD. 22 individuals with ASD and 22 age, IQ-matched controls completed a high-angular-resolution diffusion MRI scan. Structural connectivity was analysed using constrained spherical deconvolution based tractography. Regions for tractography were generated from the results of a previous study, in which 10 pairs of brain regions showed abnormal functional connectivity during visuospatial processing in ASD. WM tracts directly connected 5 of the 10 region pairs that showed abnormal functional connectivity; linking a region in the left occipital lobe (left BA19) and five paired regions: left caudate head, left caudate body, left uncus, left thalamus and left cuneus. Measures of WM microstructural organisation were extracted from these tracts. Fractional anisotropy reductions in the ASD group relative to controls were significant for WM connecting left BA19 to left caudate head and left BA19 to left thalamus. Using a multimodal imaging approach, this study has revealed aberrant white matter microstructure in tracts that directly connect brain regions that are abnormally functionally connected in ASD. These results provide novel evidence to suggest that structural brain pathology may contribute 1. to abnormal functional connectivity and 2. to atypical visuospatial processing in ASD. © 2013 McGrath, Johnson, O'Hanlon, Garavan, Leemans and Gallagher.

Improvement in visual closure, as an example of such a perceptual skill, was examined following perceptual and aesthetic instruction in photography. The effectiveness of this instruction was investigated through an objective measure, the Gestalt Completion Test, and a subjective evaluation of students' photographs by a panel of experts.     The instructional materials which were designed and developed included technical instruction in camera operation as well as lessons in perceptual and aesthetic skills. Two groups, one control and one experimental, participated in the study. Analysis of variance revealed that students who received perceptual and aesthetic instruction scored significantly higher in communicative ability than those who received technical instruction. In addition, low spatial ability students receiving the treatment, made significantly greater gains than low spatial ability students in the control group. The Gestalt Completion Test, used to measure visual closure, resulted in a ceiling effect and was not found adequate to measure current levels of visual sophistication among children.    A procedure for evaluating photographs for technical and aesthetic criteria was developed in this study. Students' photographs, as rated by a panel of experts, were judged according to this evaluation tool. Results of the study indicate that aesthetic as well as technical concepts exist in photographs, can be communicated, and can be evaluated.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Experiment I contrasted the spatial IQ scores of children who had listened to a Mozart sonata (K.448) with the scores of children who had listened to a piece of popular dance music in a pretest-post-test design. There was no significant main effect of music and no significant difference between the pretest and post-test scores for both groups. Owing to the non-significant findings, a second experiment was carried out. We used a methodology that had previously replicated the Mozart effect. Again, Expt. 2 did not support the claim that Mozart's music can enhance spatial performance. Groups performed similarly on the control test and the experimental test, irrespective of whether they listened to Mozart or to popular dance music. Since the two different designs produced similar findings, the data suggest that the Mozart effect is so ephemeral that it is questionable as to whether any practical application will come from it. In the discussion, we suggest more fruitful avenues for future research on the relationship between music and spatial performance: arousal and transfer of learning.

The Indian pattern finds spatial abilities more well developed than sequencing skills, which are superior to conceptual and acquired knowledge performances. The sample was composed of 142 Indian children, primarily Ojibwa (Chippewa). Supporting hypotheses addressed differences between groups of traditional Indian children and those who are more Anglo acculturated. The traditional children evidenced the Indian pattern of recategorized Wechsler subtest performance, while the more acculturated groups did not. Discussion of results centers on factors that may be related to the Indian pattern, such as cultural heritage, otitis media, and the school curriculum.

Applied neuropsychology. Child	https://doi.org/10.1080/21622965.2020.1807983	The impact of gene-related early infancy onset epilepsies in cognitive development can be potentially devastating. Here we report two cases of SCN8A-related epilepsy  that highlight the neuropsychological heterogeneity seen with differing de-novo  pathogenic variants. Case 1 is a 6-year-old right-handed girl who presented with  SCN8A-developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (SCN8A-DEE) and a missense  pathogenic variant (c.802A > C), not previously documented in the literature. Her  history includes speech and motor delay, with focal motor seizures starting at  4-months. Early EEG showed bilateral centroparietal epileptiform discharges. She  shows motor and language delays and prominent motor tics. Testing documented  Intellectual Disability (ID) (Mild) with widespread neuropsychological deficits  (i.e., academics, attention/executive functions, memory, visual-spatial skills, fine  motor, language). Case 2 is an 8-year-old right-handed girl who presented with  SCN8A-related epilepsy with c.5630A > G pathogenic variant with seizure onset at  5-months. Her initial EEG showed right occipital spikes. She shows low average  intellect and average academics, but evaluation documented attention deficits, fine  motor delays, and behavioral issues in addition to tics; she was diagnosed with  Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Obsessive  Compulsive Disorder, and Tourette's. These cases expand limited knowledge regarding  neuropsychological functioning of children with SCN8A-related epilepsy with unique  de-novo pathogenic variants. While SCN8A-DEE is clearly associated with ID, other  pathogenic variants may show better preserved intellect, despite other  neuropsychological and behavioral concerns.

The study sought to add to the literature on gender differences in gifted elementary school students by investigating possible gender differences in self-efficacy beliefs, attitude, and spatial skills performance--areas researchers have determined to be major causative factors of the mathematics gender gap in older children. An understanding of the gender gap in mathematics is critical for gifted educators as they seek appropriate educational strategies to meet students' needs. Independent-Measures t tests were performed to compare mean differences between 41 gifted boys' and 42 gifted girls' scores in: achievement (Test of Mathematics for Gifted Students [TOMAGS]) and IOWA Test of Basic Skills [ITBS]); attitude (Attitudes Toward Mathematics Instrument [ATMI]); and self-efficacy (predicted ability to correctly answer TOMAGS questions). Significant gender differences favoring boys were found in ITBS Total Math, self-efficacy, and ATMI scores, but not in TOMAGS scores. The open-ended format of the TOMAGS might explain this lack of consistency and offer a suggestion for fairer assessment. As technology continues to drive society, a greater demand arises for all individuals to achieve at higher levels of mathematics competency. Thus, this investigation of gender equality in mathematics can bring about social change by leading to equal opportunities for gifted girls.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Beginning 3 days after birth, until weaning, their pups were examined for eye opening, startle response, tooth eruption, surface righting, ability to cling to and climb an incline, tail pull reflex, rotation, linear movement and exploration. At 3 months of age, they were tested in a Morris Water Maze. Stressed animals were significantly lighter and shorter than non-stressed animals the first week after birth. By 3 days after birth, significantly fewer stressed animals could rotate or right themselves. By 6 days after birth, significantly fewer stressed animals could cling to or climb an inclined screen, or show the tail pull reflex. By 9 days of age, significantly fewer stressed animals had teeth. In contrast, by day 12 of age, significantly more stressed animals demonstrated exploratory behavior than did non-stressed animals. There were no sex differences in the ability of animals to perform these tasks at the same age. Stressed animals were significantly slower than non-stressed animals to reach the hidden platform in the water maze on all trials, and this difference was due to stressed females being slower to find the platform than non-stressed females, with no main effect of stress on males. This study supports and expands previous findings in rodents that prenatal stress can cause deficiencies in some early indices of physical maturation and also that these deficiencies can be continued into adulthood. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, recent studies revealed inconsistencies regarding the structure and development of VSA for different test modes (i.e., tablet-based and non-digital testing). Thus, the structure of early VSA in 84 German-speaking children aged four to six years was evaluated, using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach, for tablet-based and non-digital assessments separately and as a joint model. In addition, the influence of test mode on behavioral data regarding children's performance and the hierarchical development of VSA was addressed. CFA results support recent propositions on the structure of early VSA irrespective of test mode. However, results only partially supported the assumed hierarchical development of VSA due to considerable differences in task difficulty between test modes. Overall, these results corroborate the view of a similar structure underlying assessments of VSA across tablet-based and non-digital testing but only lend partial support to the idea of a hierarchical development of VSA. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Neuropsychologia	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.10.010	The present study reappraised the relationship between hemispheric specialization strength and cognitive skills in a sample of 297 individuals including 153  left-handers. It additionally assessed the interaction with manual laterality  factors, such as handedness, asymmetry of hand motor skills, and familial  sinistrality. A Hemispheric Functional Lateralization Index (HFLI) for language was  derived from fMRI. Through mixture Gaussian modeling, three types of language  hemispheric lateralization were defined: typical (left hemisphere dominance with  clear positive HFLI), ambilateral (no dominant hemisphere with HFLI values close to  0), and strongly-atypical (right-hemisphere dominance with clear negative HFLI  values). Three cognitive scores were derived from 12 tests covering various aspects  of verbal and spatial cognition. Compared to both typical and strongly-atypical  participants, those ambilateral for language production had lower performances in  verbal and non-verbal domains, indicating that hemispheric specialization and  cognitive skills are related in adults. Furthermore, this relationship was  independent from handedness and asymmetry for motor skills, as no interaction was  observed between these factors. On the other hand, the relationship between familial  sinistrality and cognitive skills tended to differ according to language  lateralization type. In contrast to previous reports in children, in the present  adult population, we found no linear correlation between HFLI and cognitive skills,  regardless of lateralization type.

Here we induced spatial learning impairment in mice by reducing masticatory activity and then tested the effect of a combination of environmental enrichment and masticatory rehabilitation in recovering spatial learning at adulthood and in later life. For 6 months (6M) or 18 months (18M), we fed three groups of mice from postnatal day 21 respectively with a hard diet (HD) of pellets; pellets followed by a powdered, soft diet (HD/SD, divided into equal periods); or pellets followed by powder, followed by pellets again (HD/SD/HD, divided into equal periods). To mimic sedentary or active lifestyles, half of the animals from each group were raised from weaning in standard cages (impoverished environment; IE) and the other half in enriched cages (enriched environment; EE). To evaluate spatial learning, we used the Morris water maze.Results: IE6M-HD/SD mice showed lower learning rates compared with control (IE6M-HD) or masticatory rehabilitated (IE6MHD/SD/HD) animals. Similarly, EE-HD/SD mice independent of age showed lower performance than controls (EE-HD) or rehabilitated mice (EE-HD/SD/HD). However, combined rehabilitation and EE in aged mice improved learning rate up to control levels. Learning rates did not correlate with swim speed.Conclusions: Reduction in masticatory activity imposed on mice previously fed a hard diet (HD/SD) impaired spatial learning in the Morris water maze. In adults, masticatory rehabilitation recovered spatial abilities in both sedentary and active mice, and rehabilitation of masticatory activity combined with EE recovered these losses in aged mice. © 2013 Mendes et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The present study examines preschoolers’ ability to mentally represent environments based on verbal descriptions from a survey perspective (i.e. landmark locations presented from an aerial view) or route perspective (i.e. a path along which landmarks are encountered from a person's point of view), and the relationship with the children's verbal and visuo-spatial abilities. Sixty-three five- to six-year-old children were enrolled. They listened to survey and route descriptions. Then they were assessed on landmark recognition and spatial recall with a landmark location task. Results suggested that these preschoolers could effectively learn environmental information and perform spatial recall tasks well above the chance level, with negligible differences in the survey and route conditions. Vocabulary and mental rotation accuracy were individual measures significantly associated with landmark location accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This study examines how several individual cognitive and self-reported visuo-spatial factors contribute to people's knowledge of familiar environments. Undergraduates attending a university campus area for 12 months were administered visuo-spatial (mental rotation and visuo-spatial working memory) tasks, and tested on self-reported preferences, attitudes and strategy use in approaching an environment. Their environment knowledge was tested using location, path length judgment and pointing tasks. Regression modelling on environment knowledge factors (considering all recall tasks together) showed that visuo-spatial abilities and self-reported pleasure in exploring were associated with more accurate environment representations. Some differences emerged when single environment knowledge measures were considered. The contribution of individual visuo-spatial factors to knowledge of familiar environments is discussed from the spatial cognition standpoint. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Some theoretical background on environment representation is introduced, describing the role of input sources and recall modalities, and how individual cognitive abilities relate to environment representation. The review shows that most studies have focused on navigation and wayfinding abilities using virtual environments with different environment features (e.g., regular or irregular, landmark positions along a path). Other studies have examined real movement in controlled settings. Overall, research indicates that individuals with DS are able to acquire egocentric knowledge (i.e. from the person's viewpoint) expressed by their ability to learn routes, though they may require more practice than age-matched typically-developing children or other atypical populations; and they learn as well as controls from actually completing sequences of moves or reaching clearly-identified places. Individuals with DS show poor allocentric (i.e., viewpoint-independent) knowledge compared to controls, however, expressed by the ability to find a shortcut or using external features of the environment to reach places. Other studies show that individuals with DS can also use indirect sources for environment learning, such as verbal descriptions of the environment. Some evidence suggests that individual cognitive abilities, such as non-verbal skills, are related to spatial performance, and that the visuo-spatial skills of individual with DS can be improved. This review outlines what is currently known about environment and spatial learning in individuals with DS, encompassing the theoretical background and practical implications. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In individuals with Down syndrome (DS), this skill has begun to be examined using virtual exploration. Previous studies showed that individuals with DS can learn and remember paths in terms of sequences of turns and straight stretches, albeit with some difficulty, and this learning is supported by their cognitive abilities. This study further investigates environment learning in the DS population, newly examining their ability to learn a path from actual movements, and to learn increasingly long paths, and how their performance relates to their visuo-spatial abilities and everyday spatial activities. A group of 30 individuals with DS and 30 typically-developing (TD) children matched for receptive vocabulary performed a 4 × 4 Floor Matrix task in a grid comprising 16 squares (total area 2.3 × 2.3 meters). The task involved repeating increasingly long sequences of steps by actually moving in the grid. The sequences were presented in two learning conditions, called Observation (when participants watched the experimenter’s moves), or Map (when they were shown a map reproducing the path). Several visuo-spatial measures were also administered. The results showed a clear difference between the two groups’ performance in the individual visuo-spatial measures. In the Floor Matrix task, after controlling for visuo-spatial reasoning ability, both groups benefited to the same degree from the Observation condition vis-à-vis the Map condition, and no group differences emerged. In the group with DS, visuo-spatial abilities were more predictive of performance in the Floor Matrix task in the Observation condition than in the Map condition. The same was true of the TD group, but this difference was much less clear-cut. The visuo-spatial working memory and visualization tasks were the strongest predictors of Floor Matrix task performance. Finally, the group with DS showed a significant relation between Floor Matrix task performance in the Observation condition and everyday spatial activity. These results enlarge on what we know about path learning in individuals with DS and its relation to their visuo-spatial abilities. These findings are discussed within the frame of spatial cognition and the atypical development domain. © Copyright © 2020 Meneghetti, Toffalini, Lanfranchi and Carretti.

Psychological research	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-014-0644-7	One of the aims of research in spatial cognition is to examine whether spatial skills can be enhanced. The goal of the present study was thus to assess the benefit  and maintenance effects of mental rotation training in young adults. Forty-eight  females took part in the study: 16 were randomly assigned to receive the mental  rotation training (based on comparing pairs of 2D or 3D objects and rotation games),  16 served as active controls (performing parallel non-spatial activities), and 16 as  passive controls. Transfer effects to both untrained spatial tasks (testing both  object rotation and perspective taking) and visual and verbal tasks were examined.  Across the training sessions, the group given mental rotation training revealed  benefits in the time it took to make judgments when comparing 3D and 2D objects, but  their mental rotation speed did not improve. When compared with the other groups,  the mental rotation training group did show transfer effects, however, in tasks  other than those practiced (i.e., in object rotation and perspective-taking tasks),  and these benefits persisted after 1 month. The training had no effect on visual or  verbal tasks. These findings are discussed from the spatial cognition standpoint and  with reference to the (rotation) training literature.

The aim of the present study was to examine the specific short- and long-term gains, and any transfer effects, induced by rotation training in healthy older adults. The study involved 43 healthy older adults: 14 practiced with 2 MR tasks, that is, a 3D same/different comparisons task and a Tetris game (the Mental Rotation [MR] group); 15 were trained to use a strategy based on concrete object manipulation and imagery, then practiced with the 2 rotation tasks (Strategy [S] + MR group); and 14 were involved in alternative nonspatial activities (active control group). Transfer and maintenance effects were assessed (after 1 month) using tasks similar to those used in the training (criterion tasks), different spatial tasks (mental rotation and perspective taking tasks) and a fluid intelligence task. The results showed a trend toward an improvement in successive training sessions. The S + MR and MR groups both gained substantially more than the active control group in the short- and long-term, in the criterion tasks and most of the tasks testing transfer effects. The S + MR group showed greater long-term gains than the MR group in most tasks. These findings support a positive effect of rotation training in older adults, particularly when associated with strategy use.

Research in developmental disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2017.10.019	Although certain visuospatial abilities, such as mental rotation, are crucially important in everyday activities, they have been little explored in individuals with  Down syndrome (DS). This study investigates: i) mental rotation ability in  individuals with DS; and ii) its relation to cognitive abilities and to everyday  spatial activities. Forty-eight individuals with DS and 48 typically-developing (TD)  children, matched on measures of vocabulary and fluid intelligence, were compared on  their performance in a rotation task that involved detecting which of two figures  would fit into a hole if rotated (five angles of rotation were considered: 0°, 45°,  90°, 135°, 180°). Participants were also assessed on their visuospatial and verbal  cognitive abilities, and on their parents and/or educators reports regarding their  everyday spatial activities. Results showed that: (i) individuals with DS were less  accurate in mental rotation than TD children, with larger differences between the  groups for smaller angles of rotation; individuals with DS could not mentally rotate  through 180°, while TD children could; (ii) mental rotation ability was related to  fluid intelligence and to spatial activities (though other cognitive abilities are  also involved in the latter) to a similar degree in the DS group and the matched TD  children. These results are discussed with regard to the atypical development domain  and spatial cognition models.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The abilities under investigation were visualization, displacement and transformation, creative thinking, and spatially related problem solving. Experiments were performed using 23 subjects between the ages of 8 and 11. Four cognitive-ability tests were administered to the subjects. The dependent variable, spatially related problem solving, was measured with the Differential Aptitude Test. The independent variables, visualization, displacement and transformation, and creative thinking, were measured by the Minnesota Paper Form Board Test, the Mental Rotation Test, and the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking, respectively. The results of the study indicated that spatially related problem solving abilities of children between the ages of 8 and 11 may be influenced by training in visualization and mental manipulation of two-dimensional figures and displacement and transformation of mental images of three-dimensional objects. The evidence on the existence of a relationship between perceived realism and the ability of children to create, manipulate, and utilize mental images in solving spatially related problems is inconclusive at this time. © 1994 Taylor & Francis.

Experiments were performed using 23 subjects between the ages of 8 and 11 who were enrolled in an elementary summer school program in Novato, California. Two different computer apparatuses were used: computer workstations and a cyberspace system developed by Autodesk, Inc. The workstation treatment incorporated three booklets to instruct the subjects on how to solve five different spatial relationship problems. The cyberspace treatment included two scripts to guide the subjects in solving two different spatial relationship problems.    Four cognitive ability tests were administered to the subjects. The dependent variable (i.e., spatially related problem solving) was measured with the Differential Aptitude Test. The three other measures (Minnesota Pager Form Board Test, Mental Rotation Test, and the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking) were used to partial out any effects which visualization abilities and the ability to mentally manipulate two-dimensional figures, displacement and transformation of mental images abilities, and creative thinking might have had on spatially related problem solving.    It was concluded that the relationships between perceived realism and spatially related problem solving, and creative thinking and spatially related problem solving are inconclusive at this time, but worthy of further study. Furthermore, the ability to visualize and mentally manipulate two-dimensional figures, and mentally displace and transform three-dimensional objects are predictors of spatially related problem solving abilities. Finally, cyberspace is highly promising and deserves extensive development as an instructional tool.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00258	Previous studies have reported sex differences in wayfinding performance among adults. Men are typically better at using Euclidean information and survey  strategies while women are better at using landmark information and route  strategies. However, relatively few studies have examined sex differences in  wayfinding in children. This research investigated relationships between route  learning performance and two general abilities: spatial ability and verbal memory in  153 boys and girls between 6- to 12-years-old. Children completed a battery of  spatial ability tasks (a two-dimension mental rotation task, a paper folding task, a  visuo-spatial working memory task, and a Piagetian water level task) and a verbal  memory task. In the route learning task, they had to learn a route through a series  of hallways presented via computer. Boys had better overall route learning  performance than did girls. In fact, the difference between boys and girls was  constant across the age range tested. Structural equation modeling of the children's  performance revealed that spatial abilities and verbal memory were significant  contributors to route learning performance. However, there were different patterns  of correlates for boys and girls. For boys, spatial abilities contributed to route  learning while verbal memory did not. In contrast, for girls both spatial abilities  and verbal memory contributed to their route learning performance. This difference  may reflect the precursor of a strategic difference between boys and girls in  wayfinding that is commonly observed in adults.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Seventy 9-year-olds with WS completed standardized measures of real-word reading, pseudoword decoding, reading comprehension, phonological skills, listening comprehension, nonverbal reasoning, visual-spatial ability, verbal working memory, rapid naming, and vocabulary. Reading instruction method was determined from school records and interviews with parents and teachers. Similar to prior findings for individuals with WS, reading ability varied widely, ranging from inability to read any words to reading comprehension at age level. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the primary concurrent predictor of word reading ability was reading instruction method, with a systematic phonics approach associated with considerably better performance than other reading instruction approaches. Phonological processing skills—as assessed by a composite of phonological awareness and verbal short-term memory—also contributed significant unique variance to word reading ability, as did visual-spatial ability. The concurrent predictors of reading comprehension were single-word reading and listening comprehension. These findings indicate that the factors that predict concurrent early word reading and reading comprehension abilities for children with WS are consistent with previous findings for typically developing children and that the Simple View of Reading applies to children with WS. Children with WS benefit strongly from systematic phonics instruction regardless of IQ. Instruction focused on improving listening comprehension is likely to improve reading comprehension, especially as word reading skills increase. © 2021, The Author(s).

By developing the ability to visualize, we can improve our performance in spatial ability tasks. To develop spatial ability, perceptible imitation of the space is insuffi-cient on its own; it is necessary to also manipulate the objects in this space, which requires the mental activity of children. This kind of mental activity can be achieved in geometry instruction using an appro-priate approach. For this reason, I have developed a model of instruction in this research study, in which the active role of the researcher of geometric concepts has been taken over by the learner. The learners were able to build knowledge about the properties and rela-tionships between geometric elements with their own mental activity and skills. I wished to check whether the learners, who participated in discovery learning instruction, showed any progress in their geometry knowledge at the end of the experiment compared to their initial state. It has been found that progress in geometry knowledge is indicated only if learners re-ceive active teaching methods, that is, if learning is done by discovering geometric concepts using appro-priate didactic tools. © 2019, Pedagoska Obzorja d.o.o.

These studies demonstrate nonseverely impaired visual-spatial abilities and preserved visual memory. Longitudinal data analyzing the effects of compromised perceptions on long-term visual knowledge in agnosics are limited to lesions having occurred in adulthood. The study of children with focal lesions of the visual pathways provides a unique opportunity to assess the development of visual memory when perceptual input is degraded. We assessed visual recognition and visual memory in three children with lesions to the visual cortex having occurred in early infancy. We then explored the time course of visual memory impairment in two of them at 2 years and 3.7 years from the initial assessment. All children exhibited apperceptive visual agnosia and visual memory impairment. We observed a longitudinal improvement of visual memory modulated by the structural properties of objects. Our findings indicate that processing of degraded perceptions from birth results in impoverished memories. The dynamic interaction between perception and memory during development might modulate the long-term construction of visual representations, resulting in less severe impairment. © 2013 Tiziana Metitieri et al.

This study examines emotion recognition, understanding, and regulation in a clinic-referred group of young children with nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD). These processes have been shown to be related to social competence and psychological adjustment in typically developing (TD) children. Psychosocial adjustment and social skills are also examined for this young group, and for a clinic-referred group of older children with NLD. The young children with NLD scored lower than the TD comparison group on tasks assessing recognition of happy and sad facial expressions and tasks assessing understanding of how emotions work. Children with NLD were also rated as having less adaptive regulation of their emotions. For both young and older children with NLD, internalizing and externalizing problem scales were rated higher than for the TD comparison groups, and the means of the internalizing, attention, and social problem scales were found to fall within clinically concerning ranges. Measures of attention and nonverbal intelligence did not account for the relationship between NLD and Social Problems. Social skills and NLD membership share mostly overlapping variance in accounting for internalizing problems across the sample. The results are discussed within a framework wherein social cognitive deficits, including emotion processes, have a negative impact on social competence, leading to clinically concerning levels of depression and withdrawal in this population. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Heart Disease: Lifelong Psychological Aspects and Interventions	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84948777012&doi=10.1007%2f978-88-470-5699-2_5&partnerID=40&md5=72f751bb1bbc4d164f9413b419a66359	This chapter describes the neurodevelopmental and cognitive functioning of infants, children, and adolescents with a congenital heart disease (ConHD). We will discuss the cognitive outcome within three age groups: early development, preschool age and school age, and adolescence. Different cognitive domains such as mental development, intelligence, attention, memory, language, visual perceptual and spatial skills, psychomotor skills, and executive functioning are used to structure the chapter and to keep a clear overview. Infants with ConHD already display lower scores on mental and motor development. In early childhood, gross and fine motor problems and deficits in speech functions and verbal reasoning emerge and to a lesser extent problems with visuospatial skills, number skills, and nonverbal reasoning emerge. As the cognitive demand on children increases, more problems supervene during school period and adolescence on the level of communication, handwriting, attention, visual-spatial functions, and executive functioning. These shortcomings may have a negative impact on the acquisition of adequate reading, writing, and arithmetic skills, placing a burden on the child’s school career. The need for early identification of patients at risk is stressed. © Springer-Verlag Italia 2015.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2017.07.013	An experiment was conducted to investigate the spatial memory and transformation of spatial relations in a sample of 7-, 9-, and 11-year-olds and to compare their  performance with that of adults. Four pictures of animals were presented at  different locations on the outline of a circle. Participants were instructed to  memorize the array of locations and then, in a direct retrieval task, to reconstruct  it from memory on a piece of paper that included only the circle outline. Then, in  the transformation task, participants were asked to randomly place one of the  animals at a new position around the circle and then to place the remaining three  animals so that object-to-object locations were preserved. Results from the direct  retrieval task showed that 7-year-olds were less accurate than older children and  adults, whereas 9- and 11-year-olds showed comparable performance to each other and  to adults in reconstructing the array. Results from the transformation task revealed  that adults were more accurate than children and that 11-year-olds were more  accurate than 7-year-olds. There was no difference between 9- and 11-year-olds.  Overall, these findings suggest that the ability to perform spatial transformations  (a) develops gradually during childhood and (b) has a steeper developmental slope  than the simple retrieval of memorized spatial information.

The variables measured as potential commonalities and differences were creativity, schizotypy, cognitive inhibition, spatial ability, balancing skills, positive and negative presence, absorption, mystical experiences, childhood abuse, and neuroticism. Three community groups were recruited, consisting of 31 artists, 10 people with schizophrenia, and 31 comparisons matched for gender and age with the artists. A larger student group consisting of 102 students was also recruited in order to examine the correlations among the same variables within a larger, more normative, group.    The largest commonality between the artist and the schizophrenic groups, who represented the extreme end of the schizophrenia spectrum, was the propensity to mystical experiences. The greatest differences between the artist and the schizophrenic groups were that the artists were higher in creativity, performed better on spatial abilities, had better balance, had more positive states of presence, and were lower in neuroticism than the schizophrenic group. In the student group, creativity was correlated with spatial ability, positive presence, absorption, and mystical experiences. In addition, creativity was significantly related to two facets of schizotypy, unusual experiences and impulsive nonconformity. In other words, students high in certain facets of schizotypy, who may share certain characteristics with those who have schizophrenia, are higher in creativity, but people who are on the extreme end of the schizophrenia spectrum, who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, are not.    The differences between the artist and schizophrenic groups on spatial ability, balance, sense of presence, and neuroticism may help to determine whether mystical experiences help to integrate creative work or destabilize and disorganize the sense of self. It may be that mystical experiences can be used more positively by the creative individuals than people with schizophrenia, in that artists and people high in creativity were higher in positive traits such as positive presence and lower on negative variables such as neuroticism, and introvertive anhedonia.

Methods: Twenty-one older adults, aged between 65 and 91 years were included in the study. Ten of them were in the experimental group and 11 in the passive control group. The experimental group underwent 15 training sessions of n-back training over a period of five weeks, whereas the control group remained passive. All participants (from the experimental and control group) were tested before the training, one week after the training, and three months after the training with Rey– Osterrieth/Taylor Complex Figure test (ROCF), Digit span, and TMT (part A and part B). Results and Conclusion: Results of our study suggest that although the experimental group slightly improved their performance on the trained task, the progress was not statistically significant. There was also no statistically significant transfer of training effects onto tasks of visual-spatial and verbal memory, as well as those related to executive functioning. However, the study did identify a statistically significant correlation between cognitive reserve and certain tests performed at the final testing: tasks measuring executive functioning and spatial ability. Results also revealed that the group that showed improvement in the training task was significantly better in the ROCF test in comparison with the group that had not improved their performance on the N-back task. Thus, visual-spatial abilities (visual perception, construction, and memory) were more connected with success in WM training, than other measured cognitive abilities (e.g. verbal and numerical memory). © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR	https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12860	BACKGROUND: There is very little research on the cognitive profile of young children with Williams syndrome (WS). METHOD: The present study utilised the Differential  Ability Scales - Second Edition to examine the early cognitive abilities of 22 young  children with WS (aged 3.98 to 7.70 years, 10 male and 12 female participants).  RESULTS: Overall, IQ ranged from 38 (severely impaired) to 81.00 (low average).  Consistent with Mervis et al. who looked at an older sample, over half (59.08%) of  our young WS sample showed a significant and abnormal weakness in spatial ability  relative to verbal ability. Moreover, 81.82% showed a significant and clinically  unusual weakness in spatial ability relative to nonverbal reasoning ability. At the  subtest level, only 4.55% of our sample showed a significant strength in naming  vocabulary compared with verbal comprehension, while 13.64% showed a significant  weakness in naming vocabulary relative to verbal comprehension. CONCLUSIONS: The  results of the present study show cognitive heterogeneity, consistent with the  literature on older children and adults with WS. There were variable levels of  intellect and variable patterns of cognitive strength and weakness across both index  and subtest scores. Findings highlight the need for individual assessment and  management of young children with WS but also indicate that for the majority of WS  individuals spatial skills are indeed an area of significant and abnormal weakness  and should be a focus for early intervention.

A basic feature of the WS cognitive profile is assumed to be a dissociation between verbal and spatial abilities. In our studies spatial memory performance of WS children was compared with three matched control groups. These studies allow for the analysis of several methodological and theoretical issues concerning spatial memory. The central issue in our studies was the attempt to elaborate a new task to measure spatial memory based on ecologically familiar tasks. This is the so called Map task requiring long term learning of spatial reference points and paths. Using the Map task we were able to show impaired performance in subjects with Williams syndrome both in acquiring reference points and paths. Spatial working memory capacity had a clear influence on long term spatial learning. However, retention of reference points had a stronger relationship to working memory capacity than performance regarding paths. On the whole, the Map task seems to be a useful procedure to investigate the development of spatial memory abilities.

A particular modality of data processing, clearer in many spatial tasks, has been noted in WS subjects: the tendency to process the individual details separately instead of as a whole («analytical modality»). A similar tendency is apparent in adults with right cerebral lesions. The opposite pattern («global») has been noted in subjects with Down Syndrome : the tendency to process the whole instead of the details, as commonly found in adults with left cerebral lesions. In a wider multidisciplinary research on WS, the global/analytical modality of data processing is examined in 5 italian children with WS and 5 children with mental retardation from various causes. The mean C. A. of WS subjects was = 11 years and 10 months, and their M. A. was = 5 years and 6 months. The mean C. A. of control subjects was = 11 years and 10 months, their mean M. A. was = 6 years. The following tests have been administered: Hierarchical Stimuli (Stiles), Rey Complex Figure Test-form B, Visual-Motor Integration Test, Block Design (WISC-R) and Block Construction (Stiles). Mental age was assessed by Leiter International Performance Scale. Using the Hierarchical Stimuli scores the Mann Withney U Test was conducted to compare the two groups. The results were not significant, in either global or local levels. Morever, a qualitative analysis of the performance of some subjects in the tasks of copying shows a great variability among them. Therefore this study does not confirm the analytical modality of data processing as characteristic of this sample of WS subjects. It is possible that further sudies in larger sample would confirm this data.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01226	Use of videogames (VGs) is almost ubiquitous in preadolescents' and adolescents' everyday life. One of the most intriguing research topics about positive effects of  VG use is about the domain of visuospatial competencies. Previous research show that  training with videogames enables children and adolescents to improve their scores in  visuospatial tests (such as mental rotation of shapes and cubes), and that such  training could overcome gender differences in these domains. Our study aimed at (1)  verifying the positive effects of videogame use in the visuospatial domain both for  male and female adolescents and preadolescents and (2) verifying whether the  visualization style (2D or isometric 3D) of the VG has an influence about the  positive effects of gaming. Six measures of visuospatial competency were  administered to 318 preadolescents (mean of age = 13.94 years, range 10-18) prior  and after a 3-day training with 2D and 3D Tetris. Results indicate that (1) gaming  on the whole has slight positive effects both for males and females in enhancing  visuospatial competencies, at least in the short term, and (2) it seems that  participants who used the videogame with 2D graphics obtained greater improvements  in the mental rotation domain while the participants who used the videogame with 3D  graphics obtained greater improvements in the spatial visualization domain. However,  a general learning effect between T1 and T2 was measured, which was found regardless  of Experimental condition, indicating that the effect of training with videogames  can be less relevant than expected.

Brain insults are a risk factor for neuropsychological and academic deficits across several paediatric conditions. However, little is known about the specific effects of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in boys with haemophilia. The study compared neurocognitive, academic and socio-emotional/behavioural outcomes of boys with haemophilia with and without a history of ICH. Of 172 consecutive patients seen at a Pediatric Comprehensive Care Hemophila Centre, 18 had a history of ICH. Sixteen boys between the ages of 3 and 17years were available for study and were matched to controls with haemophilia of the same age and disease severity and on the basis of maternal education. Groups were compared on neuropsychological and academic outcomes. Attention, socio-emotional function and executive skills were compared using data from parent questionnaires. Differences were found in intellectual function, visual-spatial skill, fine motor dexterity and particularly language-related skills, including vocabulary, word reading and applied math problem solving. Despite these group differences, outcomes were within the average range for most boys with ICH. No group differences were found in behavioural and socio-emotional functioning. Although ICH in haemophilia is not benign, it was not associated with significant cognitive and academic consequences for most boys. Early neuropsychological assessment may be indicated when there is a history of ICH. Investigation of age at ICH and quantitative measures of brain in relation to neurocognitive outcomes in larger groups of boys with ICH would be useful. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Its purpose is to explore a potential positive impact of an educational game application on malleability of children’s spatial skills through the application usage. The research was conducted as a pedagogical experiment in which the pre-test and post-test phases were carried out with the Mosaics, Puzzles and Patterns subtests of the SON-R 2.5-7 test battery, which is suitable for measuring general non-verbal intelligence in children aged 2.5–7. The game application which was created in the initial phase of the research was applied in the treatment phase to the experimental group. The results showed a statistically significant difference in the preschool children’s spatial ability test scores in favour of the experimental group and confirmed statistically significant benefits of the game application in each of the measured skills. The results have clearly shown that supporting the development of spatial skills through game applications is more effective than a mere use of toys and activities recommended in the current educational guidelines for pre-school children elaborated by the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

However, many kindergarten teachers still miss and long for a comprehensive, reliable and standardized diagnostic tool which could help them recognize the level of children’s school readiness. That is why the Psychological-pedagogical Centre called STEP (in the Czech Republic) developed in 2018 such a tool called the iSophi-diagnostics. Moreover, to prevent children with potential problems from being left behind, the Centre developed also the iSophi-SMART tool, which is an educational game in which a haptic and tactile experience is used in the desired learning process with the aim to develop the level of graphomotoric skills, mathematical thinking, spatial skills, time perception, verbal reasoning, and visual perception appearing in children aged 5–7. The research aimed at the investigation of the effect of the iSophi-SMART on the developmental level of the school readiness of preschool children will start this year. The first experience gained from our pilot study has already confirmed statistically significant benefits in almost each of the above mentioned cognitive areas. The biggest achievement has been noticed in the areas of spatial skills and time orientation. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Experiment 1 showed that the two groups were well matched on tactual recognition and scored equally badly on matching displays to their own mentally rotated position. Experiment 2 found the sighted superior in recall tests. There was a highly significant interaction between sighted status and degree of rotation. Degree of rotation affected only the blind. Their scores were significantly lower for rotating to oblique and to the far orthogonal directions than to near orthogonal test positions. On near orthogonals the blind did not differ from the sighted. Age was a main effect, but it did not interact with any other variable. Older blind children whose visual experience dated from before the age of 6 were superior to congenitally blind subjects, but not differentially more so on oblique directions. The results were discussed in relation to hypotheses about the nature of spatial representation and strategies by children whose prior experience derived from vision or from touch and movement. © 1976.

Learning and Individual Differences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2012.03.012	This one-year longitudinal study investigated the benefits of spatial training among highly gifted science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) undergraduates (28 female, 49 male). Compared to a randomized control condition, 12. h of spatial training (1) improved the skills to mentally rotate and visualize cross-sections of 3-D objects shortly after training, (2) narrowed gender differences in spatial skills shortly after training, and (3) improved examination scores in introductory physics (d=.38) but not for other STEM courses. After eight months, however, there were no training differences for spatial skills, STEM course grades, physics self-efficacy, or declared majors. Large gender differences, favoring males, persisted for some spatial skills, physics grades, and physics self-efficacy eight months after training. These results suggest that sustained exposure to spatially enriching activities over several semesters or years may be necessary to address gender gaps in spatial skills among highly gifted STEM undergraduates. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13396	This study took a novel approach to understanding the role of language in spatial development by combining approaches from spatial language and gesture research. It  analyzed forty-three 4.5- to 6-year-old's speech and gesture production during  explanations of reasoning behind performance on Spatial Analogies and Children's  Mental Transformation Tasks. Results showed that speech and gesture relevant for  solving the trials (disambiguating correct choices) predicted spatial performance  when controlling for age, gender, and spatial words and gestures produced. Children  performed the spatial tasks well if they produced relevant information either  verbally through speech or nonverbally through gesture. These results highlight the  importance of not only focusing on concepts children can reference but also on how  such concepts are used in spatial tasks.

Cognitive psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogpsych.2019.101264	Relations between children's spatial language and spatial skills raise questions regarding whether the effects are unique to language or reflect non-linguistic  processes. Different paradigms provided mixed evidence: experimenter-provided  language supports spatial performance more than visual cues; however, children's  non-verbal attention predicts their spatial performance more than their language  production. The current study used eye-tracking during spatial recall to compare  effects of language versus visual cues. Four- to five-year-old children completed  two tasks requiring memory for the location of a toy under one of four cups in an  array of cups and landmarks after a 5 s delay and array rotation. Children first  completed the baseline task with non-specific cues, followed by the cue-manipulation  task with either language, visual, or non-specific cues provided by the  experimenter. As in prior studies, language cues were most effective in facilitating  recall. Children's visual attention was directed by both language and visual cues to  support their recall. However, visual attention only partially mediated the effects  of language: language supported recall above and beyond directing visual attention.  These results indicate that visual attention supports spatial recall, but language  has additional unique influences. This may result from language providing a more  coherent or redundant code to visual information, or due to the pragmatic nature of  language cueing relevance in ways visual cues do not. Additionally, differences  across conditions may reflect more benefit from endogenous versus exogenous  attentional control. Through using eye-tracking, this research provided new insights  into processes by which language and visual attention influence children's spatial  cognition.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2018.02.006	Children's spatial language reliably predicts their spatial skills, but the nature of this relation is a source of debate. This investigation examined whether the  mechanisms accounting for such relations are specific to language use or reflect a  domain-general mechanism of selective attention. Experiment 1 examined whether  4-year-olds' spatial skills were predicted by their selective attention or their  adaptive language use. Children completed (a) an attention task assessing attention  to task-relevant color, size, and location cues; (b) a description task assessing  adaptive language use to describe scenes varying in color, size, and location; and  (c) three spatial tasks. There was correspondence between the cue types that  children attended to and produced across description and attention tasks. Adaptive  language use was predicted by both children's attention and task-related language  production, suggesting that selective attention underlies skills in using language  adaptively. After controlling for age, gender, receptive vocabulary, and adaptive  language use, spatial skills were predicted by children's selective attention. The  attention score predicted variance in spatial performance previously accounted for  by adaptive language use. Experiment 2 followed up on the attention task (Experiment  2a) and description task (Experiment 2b) from Experiment 1 to assess whether  performance in the tasks related to selective attention or task-specific demands.  Performance in Experiments 2a and 2b paralleled that in Experiment 1, suggesting  that the effects in Experiment 1 reflected children's selective attention skills.  These findings show that selective attention is a central factor supporting spatial  skill development that could account for many effects previously attributed to  children's language use.

This study tested  whether 4-year-olds children's (N = 41, primarily white middle class) adaptive use  of task-relevant language across contexts predicted their spatial skills. Children  were presented with a spatial scene description task, four spatial tasks, and  vocabulary assessments. Children's adaptive use of task-relevant language was more  predictive of their spatial skills than demographic and language factors (e.g.,  quantity of spatial words produced). These findings identify new links between  language and spatial cognition and highlight the importance of understanding the  quality, not just quantity, of children's language use.

Males at both ages used more Euclidean cues in their directions and were more accurate. In experiment 2, adults were given the Differential Aptitude test of spatial ability in addition to the schematic test. Sex differences were found on both measures. However, personal experience variables were related to sex differences in DAT but not schematic map performance. © 1986.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This study sought to gain a greater understanding of this phenomenon by examining the cognitive, visual-perceptual, visual-motor, and fine motor abilities of 50 VLBW children ranging in age from 84 to 131 months, comparing their performance to a control group of 50 FBW children, matched for age, gender, race, and socio-economic status (SES). The VLBW and FBW children were administered a neuropsychological test battery that assessed the following domains: general cognition; visual-perceptual abilities of figure-ground discrimination, visual closure, visual discrimination, visual-spatial skills, and visual-motor integration; and fine motor ability. Results indicated that the VLBW children performed more poorly than the FBW children on all measures of cognitive, visual-perceptual, visual-motor, and fine motor ability, with the exception of performance on a visual closure task, which was equivalent for the two groups. Fine motor ability (Finger Tapping and Grooved Pegboard Test), visual-motor integration (Beery Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration), and visual tracking skills were the strongest discriminators between the two birthweight groups after controlling for the effects of Full Scale IQ (FSIQ). A secondary purpose of the study was to determine which visual-perceptual abilities and/or fine motor abilities had the greatest influence on visual-motor performance. For VLBW children, intellectual ability (FSIQ), visual-spatial skill (Judgement of Line Orientation), fine motor ability (Grooved Pegboard), and visual closure were the strongest predictors of visual-motor performance. For the FBW group, fine motor ability (Finger Tapping), visual-spatial skill (performance on a mental rotation task), and intellectual ability (FSIQ) were the most powerful predictors of visual-motor performance. Clinical and educational implications, and directions for future research are discussed.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1
database	MIN, OK-KYUNG LEE	1984	thesis	A POSSIBLE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IDEOGRAPH KNOWLEDGE AND SPECIFIC COGNITIVE ABILITIES IN CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/possible-relationship-between-ideograph-knowledge/docview/303316148/se-2?accountid=11531	The present study investigated a possible relationship between ideograph knowledge and performance on various cognitive tasks in Korean subjects. From the literature review on differential lateralization of ideographs and phonographs it was hypothesized that ideograph learning might enhance performance on the presumably right hemisphere-dependent cognitive tasks related to two-dimensional spatial ability and simple arithmetic ability.    In experiment 1, Korean college students who immigrated to the U.S. served as subjects. Subjects were divided into high and low groups on the basis of the ideograph test scores. The low group was primarily composed of students who came to the U.S. when they were very young and therefore had not learned many ideographs. Students in the high group performed significantly better than those in the low group on verbal tasks and Raven's Progressive Matrices. There were no differences on any other measures.    In experiment 2, Korean elementary school children who attended three different private schools in Seoul were tested. Ideographs were taught in only one school. Children who were learning ideographs performed significantly better than those who were not on a simple arithmetic task. The children learning ideographs also showed an advantage on Raven's Progressive Matrices. There were no consistent differences among schools on any other measures.    The differences on verbal tests found in college students may be due to differences in exposure to Korean language rather than to a difference in ideograph knowledge. The discrepancy in the arithmetic task results between adults and children cannot be explained without further investigation. This research basically did not confirm the hypothesis about an enhancement effect of ideograph learning on spatial ability. Correlational analyses in children who were learning ideographs suggest that knowledge of ideographs may be related to cognitive abilities in general rather than to a specific cognitive skill. Untill further data are collected, speculations about a specific, lateralized enhancement effect of ideograph learning on cognition seem unjustified.

Deficits in spatial memory come with age-related cognitive decline, are marked in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and are associated with cognitive deficits in autism. In most of these disorders, a change in the brain areas engaged in the spatial reference system processing has been documented. However, the spatial memory deficits observed during physiological and pathological aging are quite different. While patients with AD and MCI have a general spatial navigation impairment in both allocentric and egocentric strategies, healthy older adults are particularly limited in the allocentric navigation, but they can still count on egocentric navigation strategy to solve spatial tasks. Therefore, specific navigational tests should be considered for differential diagnosis between healthy and pathological aging conditions. Finally, more research is still needed to better understand the spatial abilities of autistic individuals. © 2018 Miniaci MC and De Leonibus E.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	2	2	0	0	1

Biometrics	https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.12085	The aim of this article is to develop a class of spatial transformation models (STM) to spatially model the varying association between imaging measures in a  three-dimensional (3D) volume (or 2D surface) and a set of covariates. The proposed  STM include a varying Box-Cox transformation model for dealing with the issue of  non-Gaussian distributed imaging data and a Gaussian Markov random field model for  incorporating spatial smoothness of the imaging data. Posterior computation proceeds  via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Simulations and real data  analysis demonstrate that the STM significantly outperforms the voxel-wise linear  model with Gaussian noise in recovering meaningful geometric patterns. Our STM is  able to reveal important brain regions with morphological changes in children with  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	3	3	0	0	1

Child Development Perspectives	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdep.12323	Research has demonstrated strong relations between spatial skill and mathematics across ages and in both typical and atypical populations, suggesting that a significant proportion of variance in mathematics performance can be explained by variance in spatial skill. Why do these relations exist and how do they develop? Studies of dimensionality in the two domains suggest the relation holds across tasks and is not limited to specific spatial or mathematics subskills. Spatial skills might perform several functions in real-time problem solving, but these have not been differentiated empirically. The relation appears to be based on automatic shared processing, as well as strategic recruitment of spatial processes. Developmentally, the relation is consistent in its strength, but may change qualitatively, particularly in response to novel mathematics content. © 2019 Society for Research in Child Development	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

The present study tested one of these frameworks—a 2 × 2 classification scheme that crossed the dimensions of static/dynamic and intrinsic/extrinsic (Uttal et al., 2013)—using confirmatory factor analysis with data on spatial performance from kindergarten (N = 251), third grade (N = 246) and sixth grade students (N = 241). For kindergarten and third grade students, four models were tested at each grade level: A 1-factor model, two 2-factor models (one static vs. dynamic, the other intrinsic vs. extrinsic), and a 4-factor model. In sixth grade, only the 2- and 1-factor models could be tested given the available data. Evidence that the 4-factor model was the best fit would have validated the 2x2 model. However, the 4-factor models failed to converge in kindergarten and third grade. Both the 1- and 2-factor models converged in these age groups, and chi-square tests demonstrated that the 2-factor intrinsic-extrinsic model was the best fit at both grade levels. In sixth grade, only one of the 2-factor models converged and it did not fit significantly better than the 1-factor model. Thus, there was limited validation of the model in these grades, as well as a trend toward less dimensionality in spatial skill over development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Advances in child development and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-394388-0.00006-x	There is a well-known relation between spatial ability and mathematics dating back to the work of early twentieth century factor analysts. This connection is a ripe  opportunity for educators, who might use spatial training to improve math learning.  However, a closer look at the literature reveals gaps that impede direct  application. The primary problem is that although this relation is well established  in older children and adults, its emergence in early development and subsequent  developmental interactions are not well documented. Moreover, there is a need for  more mechanistic explanations that might be leveraged to improve math education. In  this chapter, we attempt to address these issues by reviewing the existing  literature to identify instances where answers are available and others where  further research is needed.

Spatial training led to better overall mathematics performance in both grades, and the gains were significantly greater than for language arts training. The same effects were found regardless of spatial training type, or the type of mathematics tested.

Children completed a battery of spatial mathematics tests and their scores were submitted to exploratory factor analyses both within and across domains. In the within domain analyses, all of the measures formed single factors at each age, suggesting consistent, unitary structures across this age range. Yet, as in previous work, the 2 domains were highly correlated, both in terms of overall composite score and pairwise comparisons of individual tasks. When both spatial and mathematics scores were submitted to the same factor analysis, the 2 domain specific factors again emerged, but there also were significant cross-domain factor loadings that varied with age. Multivariate regressions replicated the factor analysis and further revealed that mental rotation was the best predictor of mathematical performance in kindergarten, and visual-spatial working memory was the best predictor of mathematical performance in sixth grade. The mathematical tasks that predicted the most variance in spatial skill were place value (K, 3rd, 6th), word problems (3rd, 6th), calculation (K), fraction concepts (3rd), and algebra (6th). Thus, although spatial skill and mathematics each have strong internal structures, they also share significant overlap, and have particularly strong cross-domain relations for certain tasks.

Sixty-three 2nd graders (mean age 7.83) and sixty 4th graders (mean age 9.82) were administered a 2-D animal and a 3-D cube mental rotation test, a mathematics ability test, together with a self-report questionnaire devised to measure gender-stereotyped beliefs in both typical masculine, and feminine fields. Results indicated that boys scored higher than girls in mental rotation, but not in mathematics. They also highlighted that both sexes hold gender-stereotyped beliefs, and that mental rotation ability was significantly related with mathematics ability of fourth graders; however, there was no significant relationship with mathematics ability of second graders and mental rotation ability.

Gender differences and relationships with mental rotation in STEM and non-STEM students	Learning and Individual Differences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2018.10.003	Women tend not to choose STEM degrees, for a number of reasons associated with aptitudes, motivation and experience with certain spatial tasks such as mental rotation. This study considered an unexplored experiential factor: childhood preference for spatial toys and sports. It was predicted that the higher the preference for spatial activities in childhood, the higher the mental rotation performance and intrinsic motivation, and likewise the greater the probability of choosing a STEM degree. One hundred seventy-six Italian and German students attending the first year of either a STEM (n = 90) or a no STEM (n = 86) degree filled in the Mental Rotation Test, a self-report to assess intrinsic motivation, and two questionnaires to assess their actual practice with spatial sports and their childhood preference for either spatial or non-spatial toys and sports. The results showed that women in STEM degrees preferred spatial toys more than women in non-STEM degrees and performed better in mental rotation when preferred spatial toys in childhood. The discussion focuses on the relationship between childhood toy preferences and the choice of a STEM degree. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The goals of our study were to: (1) validate suitable measures for fluent reading and spelling in the first 3 years of learning Arabic; (2) trace the developmental course of the relationship between fluent reading and spelling in the first 3 years of learning Arabic; and (3) evaluate potential gender differences in literacy skills and intelligence in the setting. The performance of 111 native Arabic students of the first three grades was assessed for one-minute reading, spelling and Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM). Results showed significant developments in all measures across age. Reading fluency correlated highly with spelling measures. This association was more pronounced in the first but not in later graders. Boys performed better than girls as indicated by each of the measures used. Further analyses of first grade data indicate a potential role for the interaction of reading, gender, and CPM on the spelling scores. Based on our findings, we suggest that, in the Arabic orthography, both alphabetic and orthographic skills are adopted first for spelling. However, developing orthographic strategies in spelling does not guarantee the same transition to fluent reading processes as children in the first 3 years of learning Arabic are not yet exposed to unvowelized scripts forcing the reader to rely on orthographic strategies in order to read fluently. Moreover, our results indicate a potential role of visualization and spatial abilities in the relationship between fluent reading and spelling in the early stages of literacy acquisition, but not in later grades. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The patients with TBI often suffer impairments in psycho motor speed,  memory, attention, speed of information processing, executive functioning, fluid  intelligence, language and visuo-spatial skills. These impairments need to be  addressed as these have a significant impact on their social and occupational  functioning. Neuropsychological rehabilitation has been found to be useful in  improving cognitive and day to day functioning. It focuses on the improvement of  basic abilities which in turn enhance cognitive functioning. The aim of the present  study was to develop a home based neuropsychological rehabilitation programme and  examine its usefulness in severe TBI. A single case study method was adopted. A  detailed assessment was done at 1½ months (pre-assessment) and 9 months  (post-intervention) to evaluate the changes. Post-intervention improvement was  observed in her cognitive functions and day to day functioning. She had resumed her  previous job also. Home based neuropsychological rehabilitation emerged to be useful  in brain damaged patients.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	2	2	0	0	1

However, what shared processes account for this link? In this study, we focused on the spatial skill of map reading and the mathematical skill of proportional reasoning and investigated whether scaling, or the ability to relate information in different-sized representations, is a shared process. Scaling was experimentally manipulated in both tasks. In the map task, 4- and 5-year-olds (N= 50) were asked to point to the same position shown on a map in a larger referent space on a touch screen. The sizes of the maps were varied systematically, such that some trials required scaling and some did not (i.e., the map had the same size as the referent space). In the proportional reasoning task, children were presented with different relative amounts of juice and water and were asked to estimate each mixture on a rating scale. Again, some trials required scaling, but others could be solved by directly mapping the proportional components onto the rating scale. Children's absolute errors in locating targets in the map task were closely related to their performance in the proportional reasoning task even after controlling for age and verbal intelligence. Crucially, this was only true for trials that required scaling, whereas performance on nonscaled trials was not related. These results shed light on the mechanisms involved in the close connection between spatial and mathematical thinking early in life. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Spatial and mathematical skills were measured using standardized assessments. Children's starting points and rate of growth in spatial skills were investigated using latent growth curve models. We explored the influence of various covariates on spatial skill development and found that socioeconomic status, language skills, and sex, but not migration background predicted children's spatial development. Furthermore, our findings showed that children's initial spatial skills––but not their rate of growth––predicted later mathematical understanding, indicating that early spatial reasoning may play a crucial role for learning mathematics. © 2021 The Authors	SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	longitudinal study where there is first measurement at 3.5 y, asessed for visuospatial skills	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		5	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12065	In this study, 6-month-olds' ability to mentally rotate objects was investigated using the violation-of-expectation paradigm. Forty infants watched an asymmetric  object being moved straight down behind an occluder. When the occluder was lowered,  it revealed the original object (possible) or its mirror image (impossible) in one  of five orientations. Whereas half of the infants were allowed to manually explore  the object prior to testing, the other half was only allowed to observe the object.  Results showed that infants with prior hands-on experience looked significantly  longer at the mirror image, while infants with observational experience did not  discriminate between test events. These findings demonstrate that 6-month-olds'  mental rotations benefit from manual exploration, highlighting the importance of  motor experience for cognitive performance.

Previous studies have found evidence for such an understanding in preschoolers; however, the mental processes involved remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether children and adults use mental transformations to scale distances in space. Adults and 4- and 5-year-old children (N = 60) were asked to use maps to locate target objects in a larger referent space on a touch screen. The size of the referent space was held constant, but the sizes of the maps were varied systematically, resulting in 7 scaling factors. A linear increase in response times and errors with increasing scaling factor suggested that participants of every age group mentally transformed the size of the map to compare it to the referent, providing evidence for an analog imagery strategy in children’s and adults’ spatial scaling.

Pediatric radiology	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-020-04875-y	BACKGROUND: Spatial normalization plays an essential role in multi-subject MRI and functional MRI (fMRI) experiments by facilitating a common space in which group  analyses are performed. Although many prominent adult templates are available, their  use for pediatric data is problematic. Generalized templates for pediatric  populations are limited or constructed using older methods that result in less ideal  normalization. OBJECTIVE: The Haskins pediatric templates and atlases aim to provide  superior registration and more precise accuracy in labeling of anatomical and  functional regions essential for all fMRI studies involving pediatric populations.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Haskins pediatric templates and atlases were generated  with nonlinear methods using structural MRI from 72 children (age range 7-14 years,  median 10 years), allowing for a detailed template with corresponding parcellations  of labeled atlas regions. The accuracy of these templates and atlases was assessed  using multiple metrics of deformation distance and overlap. RESULTS: When comparing  the deformation distances from normalizing pediatric data between this template and  both the adult templates and other pediatric templates, we found significantly less  deformation distance for the Haskins pediatric template (P<0.0001). Further, the  correct atlas classification was higher using the Haskins pediatric template in 74%  of regions (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: The Haskins pediatric template results in more  accurate correspondence across subjects because of lower deformation distances. This  correspondence also provides better accuracy in atlas locations to benefit  structural and functional imaging analyses of pediatric populations.

An adult entered the room searching for an object. One candidate object was out in the open, whereas another was visible for the child but behind an occluder from the adult's perspective. When asked to help the adult find the sought-for object, 24-month-old children, but not 18-month-old children, handed him the occluded object (whereas in a control condition they showed no preference for the occluded toy). We argue that the performance of the 24-month-olds requires Level 1 visual perspective-taking skills and that this is the youngest age at which these skills have been demonstrated.

Journal of child neurology	https://doi.org/10.1177/088307389200700308	Neuropsychological outcome of 28 patients with brain tumors diagnosed before the age of 36 months (mean, 19 months) was assessed using a comprehensive battery of tests.  Elapsed time between diagnosis and testing averaged 6.2 years. Half the patients had  received cranial radiation therapy and surgery, with and without chemotherapy,  whereas the rest had received only surgery, with or without chemotherapy. Groups  were comparable with respect to tumor diagnosis and location, age at diagnosis,  race, and sex. Intellectual functioning was significantly lower in children whose  treatment included cranial irradiation than in those treated without cranial  irradiation, and this effect was more pronounced in nonverbal than in verbal  intellectual abilities. Mean scores for the radiation group were lower than for the  no-radiation group in all areas assessed and were significantly below age-based  normative means in five of the eight cognitive areas: intellectual, memory,  attention, motor, and visual-spatial skills. Mean scores for children in the  no-radiation group were generally within the average range in all cognitive areas  except visual-spatial skills, which were significantly below age-based normative  means. Endocrine deficiencies and growth retardation were much more prevalent in  patients treated with cranial irradiation. Because the immature brain is susceptible  to treatment-related pathologic changes, infants are at greater risk than older  children for significant, long-term neuropsychological, endocrine, and growth  sequelae. In children treated without cranial irradiation, morbidity was minimized  without an increased rate of mortality.	SK	0	0	0	1	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		4	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

Ss were able to represent their partner's view when the latter presented few problems in graphic complexity or mental rotation. Ss who were asked to draw their own view after drawing their partner's produced more view specific drawings than Ss asked to draw their own view first. It is concluded that the production of array-specific representations of spatial relations in young children's drawings should not be seen as a manifestation of egocentrism.

Advances in child development and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.acdb.2020.01.001	Mental rotation (MR) is the ability to imagine the appearance of an object from a different perspective. This ability is involved in many human cognitive and  behavioral activities. We discuss studies that have examined MR in infants and its  development across the first year after birth. Despite some conflicting findings  across these studies, several conclusions can be reached. First, MR may be available  to human infants as young as 3 months of age. Second, MR processes in infancy may be  similar or identical to MR processes later in life. Third, there may be sex  differences in MR performance, in general favoring males. Fourth, there appear to be  multiple influences on infants' MR performance, including infants' motor activity,  stimulus complexity, hormones, and parental attitudes. We conclude by calling for  additional research to examine more carefully the causes and consequences of MR  abilities early in life.

Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00058.x	Mental rotation involves transforming a mental image of an object so as to accurately predict how the object would look if it were rotated in space. This study  examined mental rotation in male and female 3-month-olds, using the stimuli and  paradigm developed by Moore & Johnson (2008). Infants were habituated to a video of  a 3-dimensional object rotating back and forth through a 240° angle around the  vertical axis. After habituation, infants were tested both with videos of the same  object rotating through the previously unseen 120° angle, and with the mirror image  of that display. Unlike females, who fixated the test displays for approximately  equal durations, males spent significantly more time fixating the familiar object  than the mirror-image object. Because familiarity preferences like this emerge when  infants are relatively slow to process a habituation stimulus, the data support the  interpretation that mental rotation of dynamic 3-dimensional stimuli is relatively  difficult-but possible-for 3-month-old males. Interpretation of the sex differences  observed in 3- and 5-month-olds' performances is discussed.	SK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	uploaded to include folder	ASK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	uploaded	7	7	1	NA	7	1	1	1

Psychological science	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02200.x	A sex difference on mental-rotation tasks has been demonstrated repeatedly, but not in children less than 4 years of age. To demonstrate mental rotation in human  infants, we habituated 5-month-old infants to an object revolving through a 240  degrees angle. In successive test trials, infants saw the habituation object or its  mirror image revolving through a previously unseen 120 degrees angle. Only the male  infants appeared to recognize the familiar object from the new perspective, a feat  requiring mental rotation. These data provide evidence for a sex difference in  mental rotation of an object through three-dimensional space, consistently seen in  adult populations.

Cancer nursing	https://doi.org/10.1097/NCC.0000000000000293	BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common pediatric cancer, and survival approaches 90%. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors are more likely than  healthy peers or siblings to experience academic underachievement, yet little is  known about neurocognitive predictors of academic outcomes. OBJECTIVES: Objectives  were to compare neurocognitive abilities to age-adjusted standardized norms, examine  change over time in neurocognitive abilities, and establish neurocognitive  predictors of academic outcomes. METHODS: Seventy-one children were followed over  the course of therapy. Cognitive abilities were assessed during induction when the  child was in remission (baseline) and annually for 3 years (years 1, 2, and 3).  Reading and mathematics abilities were assessed at year 3. RESULTS: Fine motor  dexterity was significantly below age-adjusted norms at all data points but showed  improvement over time. Baseline visual-motor integration was within the reference  range but significantly declined by year 3, and mean scores at years 2 and 3 were  significantly below age-adjusted norms. Verbal short-term memory was significantly  below age-adjusted norms at all assessments. Visual-motor integration predicted  reading and mathematics abilities. Verbal short-term memory predicted reading  abilities, and visual short-term memory predicted mathematics abilities.  CONCLUSIONS: Central nervous system-directed therapy is associated with specific  neurocognitive problems. Visual-spatial skills and verbal and visual short-term  memory predict academic outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Early assessment of  visual-spatial perception and short-term memory can identify children at risk of  academic problems. Children who are at risk of academic problems could benefit from  a school-based individual educational program and/or educational intervention.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A highly reliable coding system was developed to score constructive and fantasy play evidenced by preschoolers using interlocking plastic blocks (Legos). A technique to modify children's play styles was developed in which an adult guided children in their play using a newly-designed instruction booklet entitled "How to Play With Legos." In the "Constructive" version of the adult intervention, instructions emphasized how to build with Lego blocks. In the "Fantasy" version, instructions emphasized how to tell stories with Lego blocks. These techniques were used with a final sample of 20 children consisting of 10 boys and 10 girls, ranging in age from four to five. Children were randomly assigned, within sex, to the constructive or fantasy interventions. All children first played with Legos in a free-play session; followed by the adult intervention; another free-play session; and a spatial task in which children were given photographs of Lego constructions, and asked to reproduce them independently. Children who were exposed to the constructive adult model intervention performed significantly better on the model building task than did children who were exposed to the fantasy adult model intervention. There were some indications that the subsequent play styles of the two groups differed as well, although these findings were far more tentative. Taken together, the results of the research are useful in establishing important coding and intervention tools that can be used for future work on the relationship between young children's play styles and the development of specific cognitive skills. In addition, the data provide support for earlier researchers' suggestion that spatial skills are enhanced through particular kinds of block play that may be more common among boys than girls.

However, there is no agreement concerning the age at which they begin to integrate and flexibly use both strategies in smallscale environments. Method: 6-10-year-old children and adults were trained to locate a hidden object in an arm-maze placed within a small-scale model, which maintained stable relationships with the frames of reference provided by the experimental room and by the subject (Experiment 1), and in a situation of inconsistency between the frame provided by the smallscale model and the other two (Experiment 2). Results: When the frames of reference provided by the room and by the subject conflict with that of the manipulative space, the performance deteriorates compared to the situation when multiple frames of reference can be used cooperatively to locate the goal. The flexible use of the information provided by the model (i.e., the cues surrounding the maze and the geometrical features) emerged at 10 years. Conclusions: Through development, children acquire new spatial abilities and increasing flexibility in the conjoint use of egocentric and allocentric frames of reference in small-scale environments. © 2013 Psicothema.

The results for the intermediate effects are not consistent and there are only a few studies on this issue. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the short-term and intermediate effects of a preschool training program stimulating numerical competencies for children at risk of developing dyscalculia (≤ 10th percentile). During the last kindergarten year, 32 children at risk were trained with a combination of the intervention Mathematik im Vorschulalter and Mengen, zählen, Zahlen by their kindergarten teachers, who were trained and supervised. Contents of the preschool training were: counting, number knowledge up to 10, comprehension of quantity concept, visual differentiation, spatial ability, simple arithmetic operation, handling of symbols, realizing abstract-logical correlations, and identifying cause-effect relations. The training lasted 11 weeks and took place twice a week (session duration = 30-40 min). Children who participated in at least 50% of the sessions were included. The control group consisted of 38 untrained children at risk. For measuring numerical competencies in kindergarten, a subtest of the instrument Basisdiagnostik Umschriebener Entwicklungsstörungen im Vorschulalter - Version III (BUEVA-III) was used, and for measuring mathematical performance the test Deutsche Mathematiktest für erste Klassen (DEMAT 1+) was used. Before the training there were no group differences between the training and control group regarding mathematical performance and overall intelligence. The training showed positive short-term effects for numerical competencies in the last kindergarten year (medium effect size). While trained children could significantly improve their mathematical competencies to an average level (from 34 to 41 t-value points), the performances of the untrained children stayed below average. Unfortunately, there were no significant intermediate effects for mathematical performance in the second half of the first grade. Regarding the diagnosis of dyscalculia as defined by the ICD-10, it was not possible to gather a sufficiently large sample in the first grade fulfilling the criteria to test differences between training and control groups. Methodological limitations of this study were the missing random allocation to treatment conditions, a large drop-out rate, and long testing periods. The preschool training that was used to stimulate numerical competencies contributed significantly toward improving numerical competencies in the short term. Further investigations will determine the long-term effects of the training in the second and third grade. This is particularly important because dyscalculia occurring from the second grade on is a stable phenomenon. © 2018 Hogrefe Verlag.	SK	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		1	1	1	NA	1	0	0	1

Frontiers in sports and active living	https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.664640	Background: Regular physical exercise plays an integral part in the psychomotor and psychosocial development of children and adolescents, with complex motor and  cognitive processes closely linked. Spatial abilities, one aspect of cognitive  functioning start to evolve from earliest childhood and reach adult-like levels by  early adolescence. As they have been associated with good spatial orientation,  wayfinding, map-reading skills, problem solving or analyzing spatial information,  these skills facilitate independence and autonomy while growing up. Despite  promising results, only few studies investigate this relation between physical  exercise and spatial abilities. To use this benefit and develop purposive physical  exercise interventions, it is essential to summarize the current evidence.  Objectives: This literature review aims to systematically summarize findings  regarding the impact of physical exercise interventions on spatial abilities in  healthy children and adolescents and identify knowledge gaps. Methods: A systematic  search of the literature according to the PRISMA guidelines was conducted on the  databases Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, SportDiscus, and PsycInfo from  their inception date till March 2021. Additionally, Google Scholar and refence lists  of relevant publications were searched. A descriptive analysis of results was  conducted. Results: The literature search identified a total of N = 1,215 records,  11 of which met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in this review. A total of  621 participants aged 4 to 15 years participated in the studies. Exercise  interventions included sport-specific activities, motor-coordinative exercises,  high-intensity functional training or spatial orientation/navigation training. Five  studies evaluated training effects on mental rotation performance (i.e., Mental  Rotation Test), four studies investigated visuo-spatial working memory  function/spatial memory (i.e., Corsi Block Test, Virtual Reality Morris Water Maze)  and two studies tested spatial orientation capacity (i.e., Orientation-Running  Test). Overall, results show a potential for improvement of spatial abilities  through physical exercise interventions. However, keeping the diversity of study  designs, populations and outcomes in mind, findings need to be interpreted with  care. Conclusions: Despite growing interest on the effects of physical exercise  interventions on spatial abilities and promising findings of available studies,  evidence to date remains limited. Future research is needed to establish how spatial  ability development of healthy children and adolescents can be positively supported.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	2	2	0	0	1

Undergraduate university students (n = 62) completed the Mental Rotation Test (citationReference id=cr32-1rid= c32 Vandenberg & Kuse, 1978/citationReference), before and after a 10-month training in two different sports, which either involved extensive mental rotation ability (wrestling group) or did not (running group). Both groups showed comparable results in the pretest, but the wrestling group outperformed the running group in the posttest. As expected from previous studies, males outperformed women in the pretest and the posttest. Besides, self-reported data gathered after both sessions indicated an increase in adaptive strategies following training in wrestling, but not subsequent to training in running. These findings demonstrate the significant effect of training in particular sports on mental rotation performance, thus showing consistency with the notion of cognitive plasticity induced from motor training involving manipulation of spatial representations. They are discussed within an embodied cognition framework.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Despite several evidences have highlighted the need for an early introduction of re-habilitation interventions, such interventions are rarely adapted to children’s visual capabilities and very few studies have been conducted to assess their long-term efficacy. In this work, we present a case study of a visually impaired child enrolled in a newly developed re-habilitation intervention aimed at improving the overall development through the diversification of re-habilitation activities based on visual potential and developmental profile, with a focus on spatial functioning. We argue that intervention for visually impaired children should be (a) adapted to their visual capabilities, in order to increase re-habilitation outcomes, (b) multi-interdisciplinary and multidimensional, to improve adaptive abilities across development, (c) multisensory, to promote the integration of different perceptual information coming from the environment. © Copyright © 2020 Morelli, Aprile, Cappagli, Luparia, Decortes, Gori and Signorini.

Key features for its diagnosis include fluctuating cognition associated with disturbances of consciousness, persistent or recurrent visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. So many debates around this clinical syndrome focused mainly on clinical criteria for the operationalised diagnosis of DLB, the specificity of diagnosis has been high, but sensitivity has been poor. On the contrary, there have been a paucity of studies examining the neuropsychological problems of DLB. Here, we would like to discuss general cognitive performances of only two patients, with a strenuous follow-up of thirty-six months, with particular concern on visuo-spatial skills.

We tested genetic moderation of indirect effects from parenting behavior to youth ADHD symptoms through multiple neurocognitive factors. Two hundred and twenty-nine youth with and without ADHD were assessed at baseline (Wave 1; ages 5–10) and at a 2-year follow-up (Wave 2; ages 7–13). At Wave 1, youth completed a neurocognitive battery including measures of response inhibition, visuospatial working memory, and fluid reasoning, and a standardized parent–child interaction task yielding observational measures of positive and negative parenting. At Wave 2, youth psychopathology was rated by parents and teachers using multiple methods (i.e., structured interview, rating scale). We employed moderated multiple mediation and compared conditional indirect effects across youth genotypes at two biologically plausible genetic loci. Controlling for parent ADHD symptoms as well as youth demographic factors and co-occurring externalizing symptoms, these genetic factors moderated the indirect effect from Wave 1 parenting to multi-method/informant Wave 2 ADHD symptoms through Wave 1 neurocognitive functioning. This preliminary study is the first to identify genetic moderation of mediated effects underlying ADHD symptoms and suggests that specific gene × parenting interactions may underlie neurocognitive functioning deficits and subsequent ADHD. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Archives of disease in childhood	https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2012-302525	OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between teenage motherhood and cognitive development at 5 years. DESIGN: Data from Millennium Cohort Study, a prospective,  nationally representative UK cohort of 18 818 infants born between 2000 and 2001.  PARTICIPANTS: 12 021 (64%) mother-child pairs from white, English-speaking,  singleton pregnancies were included. METHODS: Cognitive ability at 5 years was  measured by the British Ability Scales II. Difference in mean cognitive scores  across maternal age groups was estimated using linear regression, with adjustment  for potential confounders and mediators. RESULTS: 617 (5%) children were born to  mothers aged ≤18 years. Our analysis revealed that children of teenage mothers had  significantly lower cognitive scores compared with children of mothers aged 25-34  years: difference in mean score for verbal ability -8.9 (-10.88 to -6.86, p<0.001);  non-verbal ability -7.8 (-10.52 to -5.19, p<0.001); spatial ability -4.7 (-6.39 to  -3.07, p<0.001), which is equivalent to an average delay of 11, 7 and 4 months,  respectively. After adjustment for perinatal and sociodemographic factors, the  effect of young maternal age on non-verbal and spatial ability mean scores was  attenuated. A difference persisted in the mean verbal ability scores -3.8 (-6.34 to  -1.34, p=0.003), equivalent to an average delay of 5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Results  suggest that the difference observed in the initial analyses for non-verbal and  spatial skills are almost entirely explained by marked inequalities in  sociodemographic circumstances and perinatal risk. However, there remains a  significant adverse effect on verbal abilities in the children born to teenage  mothers.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Material and methods: Prospective, observational, multicentre, open-label study of patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic or asymptomatic metastatic PCa scheduled to receive LHRH analogues for ≥ 6 months. We assessed four CP domains at baseline and after 6 months of ADT: 1) Working memory: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS III) Digit Span Subtest (WAIS III-Digit); 2) Visual memory: ad hoc visual memory test; 3) Visuospatial ability: Judgement of Line Orientation (JLO) and Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects (3D-Rotation); and 4) Nonverbal analytical reasoning: WAIS III Matrix Reasoning Test (WAIS III-MRT). Changes outside the baseline 95% confidence intervals were considered significant. Results: A total of 308 patients completed the study. Of these, 245 (79.6%) experienced no statistically significant changes on any test and 63 patients (20.4%) experienced significant changes in ≥ 1 test. Of these, most presented a change in only one test, distributed evenly between improvements (58 patients; 18.8%) and worsening (56 patients; 18.2%). For individual tests, most patients (87.8% to 91.8%) had no change from baseline; however, the significant changes (improvement vs. deterioration, respectively) were as follows: WAIS III-Digit (6.3% vs. 5.9%); visual memory (5.3% vs. 5.7%); JLO (5.3% vs. 4.5%); 3D-Rotation (4.1% vs. 4.1%); and WAIS III-MRT (4.8% vs. 5.8%).

For individual tests, most patients (87.8%-91.8%)  had no change from baseline; however, the significant changes (improvement vs  deterioration) were as follows: WAIS III Digit Span subtest (6.3% vs 5.9%), visual  memory (5.3% vs 5.7%), Judgment of Line Orientation test (5.3% vs 4.5%), Mental  Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects test (4.1% vs 4.1%), and WAIS III Matrix  Reasoning test (4.8% vs 5.8%). CONCLUSIONS: CP in patients with PCa does not appear  to be adversely affected by 6 months of LHRH analogue administration.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The study utilized a causal-comparative research design involving group comparisons. In this design researchers collect data about variables that they have conceptualized to be in a causal relationship to each other, but there is no intervention as in experimental research. Participants in this study included approximately 200 students in second through eighth grades at one public school and one public charter school, all located in the same school district/county. Spatial ability was measured by four categories of spatial relations tests based upon spatial cognition research proposing that spatial cognition is comprised of "three separable dimensions:" the Mental Folding Test for Children (spatial visualization), an adaptation of the Differential Aptitude Test: Space Relations (DAT: SR), Mental Rotation for Children, an adaptation of the Mental Rotations Test (MRT), Manikin Test (spatial orientation and transformation), and Mr. Peanut Test (visuo-spatial working memory). The resultant scores were used as measures of mathematical achievement and cognitive ability. Data were analyzed using MANOVA and ANOVA statistical analysis. Results suggested that mostly non-significant differences exist for spatial visualization abilities between males and females. The sole example of a significant difference between male and females was noted on the Mr. Peanut test in the fourth and fifth grades, accompanied with a partial Eta Squared (η2) of .10.

We tested 10 boys (mean age 11.65 years) with an extremely rare disorder of androgen excess (Familial Male Precocious Puberty, FMPP) and 40 healthy boys (mean age 12.81 years) on a virtual version of the Morris Water Maze task. In addition, anatomical magnetic resonance images were collected for all patients and a subsample of the controls (n=21) after task completion. Behaviourally, no significant differences were found between both groups. However, in the MRI analyses, grey matter volume (GMV) was correlated with performance using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Group differences in correlations of performance with GMV were apparent in medial regions of the prefrontal cortex as well as the middle occipital gyrus and the cuneus. By comparison, similar correlations for both groups were found in the inferior parietal lobule. These data provide novel insight into the relation between testosterone and brain development and suggest that morphological differences in a spatial navigation network covary with performance in spatial ability. © 2011.

We also examined whether these beliefs related to parents’ encouragement of their child to pursue a Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) career as well as students’ actual STEM major and career intentions. Data were collected from 117 pairs of U.S. high school students and one of their parents. We found that parents of young men thought their child had higher mental manipulation and navigation abilities than did parents of young women, even after statistically controlling for adolescents’ actual spatial abilities. Parents who perceived that their child had higher mental manipulation ability were more likely to encourage their child to pursue a STEM career, and those students were more likely to report that they intended to pursue a STEM career. These findings suggest that parents’ beliefs about how good their child is at spatial tasks may be based more strongly on gender stereotypes than on their child’s actual spatial abilities. Helping to make parents aware of these beliefs could be a potential lever of intervention to increase women’s participation in STEM careers. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Three different occupational groups or castes: weaver, potter, and farmer are studied in a rural Indian setting. Vygotsky's culture theory of cognition posits that children's cognition develops as a product of interaction with the environment. Learning, as a result, in a context takes place as a social transaction where the context furnishes the three salient features for leaning--props, processes, and procedures (Bruner, 1985). An adult, or a more competent peer, provides a child with a "vicarious form of consciousness until such a time as the learner is able to master his own action through his consciousness and control" (p. 24). Once the child reaches the new conceptual level, she or he is able to "use" it as a tool. Up to that point, he/she is under the control of and monitored by an adult. This is the process of "scaffolding," or learning under guidance, which moves a child beyond his/her present "level of development;" the process provides the child with the culturally controlled tools of amplification appropriate for his/her cognitive functioning. Every culture provides the context for acquiring and sharing of skills and knowledge to its members for their meaningful survival. The cognitive demands arising out of a cultural context determine the cognitive abilities and skills of its members. The aim of the study is to describe the development of spatial skills in work settings. The instrument, generated from the emic information, utilizes the strategy of incorporating familiar tasks in familiar contexts and gradually changing the mode/context and complexity of the task to assess the cognitive transfer of the particular skills. All spatial tests support the hypothesis of occupationally related development of spatial skills at $p < .0001$ level. However, the same effects are not demonstrated in other areas of cognitive functioning, such as understanding arithmetic operations. This ethnographic study elucidates the process of scaffolding that appears to be common in all levels of informal learning and should help in providing plausible explanations as to how children's cognitive abilities develop successfully in everyday life.

Dynamic systems and embodied cognition theory are discussed first, followed by a summary of studies investigating mental rotation and spatial memory (including memory for object locations, orientation, and navigation), two central aspects of spatial cognition that emerge in the first years of life. The chapter argues against the notion that children learn specific skills at specific "set" ages-rather, children are able to do particular things, such as remembering an object's location, under specific circumstances and after having had specific experiences. Here we describe the dynamics of both typical and atypical development of mental rotation and spatial memory in relation to both these factors, addressing how these aspects of spatial cognition are often assessed at various ages, and how advances in motor development allow children to learn increasingly more about the world around them through exploration. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The discussion aims to complement the commentary by Dindyal, focused on background research on geometry and implications for pedagogy and curricula. Spatial reasoning is considered as a common underlying theme salient to most of the papers in this issue. The fundamental role of spatial ability or visual thinking skills in young children is traced through the various theoretical approaches of studies ranging from concepts such as perspective taking, symmetry, and two- and three-dimensional shape, to the role of technological tools in mapping and location. Intervention studies to promote early spatial reasoning also provide insight into effective transformative practices. New questions are raised about the crucial development of spatial reasoning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education. The commentary suggests the need for a more strategic research agenda that aims to coordinate the key questions and methodologies that investigate what may seem common problems. © 2015, FIZ Karlsruhe.

The biological roots of music have been studied. The links between music exposure and social behavior are well established. Many studies have also determined the benefits of music training and exposure on neural development and cognitive performance. Western classical music exposure and training were specifically shown in several studies to enhance spatial skills performance in children and young adults. While the traditional forms of intelligence have been studied in relation to music exposure and training, no studies have determined the relationship between music training and emotional intelligence, which may be more related to broader measures of social success and good health. Music training has the potential to influence a foundational component of emotional intelligence, emotional awareness, which is based on a cognitive-developmental model developed by Lane (1990). The potential links between music training and emotional awareness stem from research demonstrating music's effects on emotional response and higher sensitivity to musically elicited non-specific emotional arousal for musicians than non-musicians, and music's potential to increase emotional perception. One research study shows that females demonstrated higher levels of emotional awareness than males. Sixty subjects divided into two groups of musically trained and non musically trained males and females (15 in each group) completed the Level of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS), yielding levels of emotional awareness scores. The results of a 2 x 2 Analysis of Variance showed no significant main or interaction “effects” between musicianship groups and gender groups on levels of emotional awareness. A Pearson Product Moment correlation yielded no significant correlations between LEAS scores and years of training, years of education, age, and age of music training commencement. Limitations of this study, as well as recommendations for future research will be discussed. The clinical implications of various forms and modes of musical activities under therapeutic and educational contexts potentially to enhance emotional intelligence will be mentioned.

Asian journal of psychiatry	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102435	BACKGROUND: Older adults with depression often have cognitive deficits contributing to higher morbidity and increased risk for conversion to dementia. Research on this  area is limited from India. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study is to  examine the neuropsychological measures in older adults with Late-onset depression  (LOD) compared to healthy controls (HC). METHOD: Sample included older adults with  depression as per DSM-IV TR criteria seeking treatment from Geriatric Clinic and  Services, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS). Geriatric  depression scale, Montgomery Asberg depression rating scale and Hamilton anxiety  rating scale were applied to screen and measure the severity of depression.  Comprehensive assessment of neurocognitive function was done using NIMAHNS  Neuropsychological Battery for Elderly (NNBE, 2013). RESULTS: Sample included 76 LOD  patients and 76 healthy controls (HC) who were matched for age, gender and  education. The mean age of onset of illness was 63.17(SD-6.54) years and median  duration of total illness was 29.5 months. In the standard assessments, the mean  score on GDS was 9.28 (SD-3.32) and MADRS was 18.88 (SD-6.07). The LOD group had  lower Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE) score compared to HC (28.64 ± 2.09 vs  30.05 ± 1.26, p < 0.001). Compared to HC, LOD group performed poorly on tasks of  attention, executive function, verbal and visual memory, verbal fluency and  visuo-spatial skills. Recognition memory and logical memory were relatively  preserved in LOD compared to HC. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Cognitive deficits were  seen predominantly in attention and executive function, visuo-spatial skills and  memory similar to previous studies. It is advisable to routinely assess cognitive  symptoms in older adults presenting with depression.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

With correlational analyses, using a composite spatial score, it was ascertained that the background variables of significance for predicting spatial performance were age, years of schooling (especially for girls), directed distance from home (for boys), and proportion of time spent manipulating objects (the last two indices were derived from naturalistic observations conducted 4 years earlier). The results confirm the earlier finding (Munroe & Munroe, 1971) that movement through the environment is an important source of learning spatial skills for boys. The findings also indicate that direct tuition may be more important for the development of spatial skills in girls. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Journal of applied developmental psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appdev.2021.101348	Prenatal marijuana exposure (PME) negatively impacts child development and behavior; however, few studies have examined these associations at early ages among children  exposed to today's highly potent marijuana. Using a prospective prenatal cohort  (Columbus, Ohio, USA), PME was determined from maternal self-report, medical chart  abstraction, and urine toxicology from prenatal visits and delivery. At age 3.5  years, 63 offspring children completed tasks assessing executive function (EF),  visual spatial ability, emotion regulation, and aggressive behavior. Caregivers  reported on children's EF and problem behaviors. Logistic regressions and analyses  of covariance controlling for key variables were used to examine associations  between PME and child outcomes. Compared to non-exposed children, children with PME  had more sleep-related problems, withdrawal symptoms, and externalizing problems,  including aggressive behaviors and oppositional defiant behaviors. Children with and  without PME did not differ in terms of executive functioning. Findings suggest  behavioral problems associated with PME may manifest by age 3.5.

The right striate cortex was found to be larger than the left in 24 of 31 cases. On the average, the right striate cortex was larger than the left by about 5%; this difference was statistically significant. Although past studies indicated that the posterior cerebrum is anatomically asymmetrical, no consistent pattern had been found, and no study had examined the actual volume of the striate cortex in the two hemispheres. The demonstration of asymmetries in the striate cortex is important because differences exist between the hemispheres in a wide range of perceptual and spatial skills related to vision. I suggest that the striate cortical asymmetry is related to the right hemisphere's superiority in visuospatial functioning. © 1985.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

The  epileptic group showed lower score in IQ performance and in three verbal subtests  (Information, Digit span, Arithmetic) and three performance subtests (Block Design,  Object Assembly and Coding). Patients with right hemisphere EEG focus showed low  score in subtests related to spatial ability and non-verbal attention, whereas  patients with left hemisphere EEG focus showed low score only in Digit span subtest  (related to immediate memory and verbal attention). The authors suggest that  cognitive deficits in partial non-lesional epileptic children is related to the side  of EEG interictal abnormalities, even in children with normal IQ.

The target word was presented within semantically organized input in the form of a ‘narrative’ to the experimental group and within ‘unconnected speech’ to the control group. We tested children's learning by asking them to perform an UNDER-relation before, immediately after, and again one day after the training using familiarized and unfamiliarized materials. Compared to controls, the experimental group learned better and retained more. Children with advanced expressive lexicons in particular were aided in generalizing to unfamiliarized materials by the narrative presentation. This study extends our understanding of how narrations scaffold young children's enrichment of nascent word knowledge.	SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		ASK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		5	5	1	NA	5	0	0	1

Purpose: This study is aimed at understanding the relationship between visualspatial abilities and eye-hand coordination based on the 'Re-training Approach'. An underlying assumption of this approach is that skills learned for one task can be generalised to other areas. Method: Three children with Down syndrome were initially tested for eyehand coordination, and the tests were repeated periodically throughout the intervention programme which comprised visual-spatial activities. Results: The authors observed that there was a steady improvement in the eyehand coordination as well as the visual-spatial abilities of children involved in the intensive therapy programme. This improvement manifested in the reduction of time taken to perform the coordination tests and in the errors made while performing the tests.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		3	2	0	2	2	0	0	1

Children with ASD have been reported to show less susceptibility to spatial inversion. The aim of this study is to examine whether children with ASD utilize atypical abilities in socioemotional processing. This study tested 13 children with ASD (1 girl, M: 15.10 years, standard deviation [SD]: 1.60 years), 13 children without ASD (3 girls, M: 15.92 years, SD: 1.03 years), and 20 control adults (11 women, M: 24.77 years, SD: 8.30 years) to investigate the speed and accuracy of their responses to images of neutral faces and faces expressing “easy” (happiness, anger) and “difficult” emotions (surprise, fear) in nonrotated (0°) and rotated (30°, 90°, 150°, 180°, 210°, 270°, and 330°) positions. The results showed that children with ASD recognized both easy and difficult emotions as accurately as did children and adults without ASD. Children with ASD, however, responded significantly faster to difficult emotions when the images were rotated. These results offer less support for a deficiency model than for an atypical, rapid featural type of processing used by children with ASD to encode and understand complex socioemotional stimuli. © The Author(s) 2018.

Careful analysis of the visual information available for these tasks shows that successful performance could be based on the much simpler process of storing a visual 'snapshot' at the target location, and subsequently moving in order to match it. We tested 4-8-year olds on a new spatial reorientation task that could not be solved based on information directly contained in any retinal projection that they had been exposed to, but required participants to infer how the space is structured. Only 6-8-year olds showed flexible recall from novel viewpoints. Five-year olds were able to recall locations given movement information or a unique proximal landmark, but without these they could not do so, even when they were not disoriented or when the landmark was a familiar object. These results indicate that early developing spatial abilities based on view matching and self motion are supplemented by a later-developing process that takes into account the structure of spatial layouts and so enables flexible recall from arbitrary viewpoints. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Cognitive processing	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-021-01052-3	Our experience of the world seems to unfold seamlessly in a unitary 3D space. For this to be possible, the brain has to merge many disparate cognitive representations  and sensory inputs. How does it do so? I discuss work on two key combination  problems: coordinating multiple frames of reference (e.g. egocentric and  allocentric), and coordinating multiple sensory signals (e.g. visual and  proprioceptive). I focus on two populations whose spatial processing we can observe  at a crucial stage of being configured and optimised: children, whose spatial  abilities are still developing significantly, and naïve adults learning new spatial  skills, such as sensing distance using auditory cues. The work uses a model-based  approach to compare participants' behaviour with the predictions of alternative  information processing models. This lets us see when and how-during development, and  with experience-the perceptual-cognitive computations underpinning our experiences  in space change. I discuss progress on understanding the limits of effective spatial  computation for perception and action, and how lessons from the developing spatial  cognitive system can inform approaches to augmenting human abilities with new  sensory signals provided by technology.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00662.x	Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder associated with severe visuocognitive impairment. Individuals with WS also report difficulties with everyday wayfinding.  To study the development of body-, environment-, and object-based spatial frames of  reference in WS, we tested 45 children and adults with WS on a search task in which  the participant and a spatial array are moved with respect to each other. Although  individuals with WS showed a marked delay, like young controls they demonstrated  independent, additive use of body- and environment-based frames of reference.  Crucially, object-based (intrinsic) representations based on local landmarks within  the array were only marginally used even by adults with WS, whereas in typical  development these emerge at 5 years. Deficits in landmark use are consistent with  wayfinding difficulties in WS, and may also contribute to problems with basic  localization, since in typical development landmark-based representations supplement  those based on the body and on self-motion. Difficulties with inhibition or mental  rotation may be further components in the impaired ability to use the correct  reference frame in WS.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

These conceptual stereotypes seem to assign a less favorable role to females. Thus it seems plausible that their acceptance (by both sexes) might be at least partly responsible for the performance differences that begin to arise in adolescence and adulthood. In view of the importance of early adolescence as a transitional period during which sex-role requirements are augmented and intellectual sex differences emerge, 105 11-year-olds and 102 14-year-olds were selected as subjects. Their spatial abilities, sex-role concepts, and sex-role preferences were assessed. Stereotyping sex roles (in general) was not associated with spatial performance; stereotyping sex roles that included information regarding subjects' views about intellectual competence was related to performance. The sex difference in spatial ability that emerged at age 14 was among subjects with own-sex preferences only; there were no sex differences among subjects who preferred to be boys. © 1975 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

They were of average intelligence. In terms of lateralized cognitive skills, PA had no effect on verbal fluency. The spatial abilities of females with a history of PA, who had reached gonarche (were fully pubertal), were inferior to those of females tested in the midst of PA and to population controls. The physiologic/hormonal changes associated with normal adrenarche may curtail further specialization of the right hemisphere, resulting in a relative spatial deficit among females in general, who as a group reach adrenarche earlier than males. This spatial performance deficit is exaggerated in females with PA. © 1990.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs		Spatial ability of 60 left-handed and 60 right-handed school children was investigated using a battery of nine tasks. The results do not agree with Levy's  (1969, 1976) theory predicting spatial inferiority of left-handed individuals.  Instead, higher performance by left-handed children provided further support for  Annett's (Annett & Manning, 1989) theory on intelligence and for Geschwind's  (Geschwind & Galaburda, 1985) hypothesis of "pathology of superiority." The  distinction of left-handed and right-handed individuals into familial and  nonfamilial groups appeared to be psychologically equivocal according to our  results.

Here we studied the recovery of spatial hearing in two sequential bilateral CI recipients, adopting a longitudinal approach. Each recipient was tested in a sound-source identification task shortly after bilateral activation and at 1, 6, and 12 months follow-up. The results show fast recovery (1 month from CI activation) in the recipient who had substantial experience with auditory cues in adulthood. By contrast, the bilateral CI recipient who developed profound deafness in childhood, regained spatial hearing abilities only 12 months after CI activation. These findings provide the first direct evidence that recovery of auditory spatial abilities in bilateral CI recipients can occur shortly after activation of the two devices. In addition, they suggest that previous auditory experience can constrain the time course of this recovery. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12840	Combining information across different sensory modalities is of critical importance for the animal's survival and a core feature of human's everyday life. In adulthood,  sensory information is often integrated in a statistically optimal fashion, so that  the combined estimates of two or more senses are more reliable than the best single  one. Several studies have shown that young children use one sense to calibrate the  others, which results in unisensory dominance and undermines their optimal  multisensory integration abilities. In this study we trained children aged 4-5 years  with action-like mini games, to determine whether it could improve their  multisensory as well as their visuo-spatial skills. Multisensory integration  abilities were assessed using a visuo-haptic size discrimination task, while  visuo-spatial attention skills were investigated using a multiple object tracking  task (MOT). We found that 2-weeks training were sufficient to observe both optimal  multisensory integration and visuo-spatial enhancements selectively in the group  trained with action-like mini games. This plastic change persisted up to 3 months,  as assessed in a follow-up. Our novel findings reveal that abilities that are  commonly known to emerge in late childhood can be promoted in younger children  through action-like mini games and have long-lasting effects. Our data have clinical  implications, in that they suggest that specific trainings could potentially help  children with multisensory integration deficits.

Vision research	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0042-6989(00)00177-2	We studied the motion perception abilities in a young adult, SF, who had her right occipito-temporal cortices resected to treat epilepsy. Following resection, SF  showed transient deficits of both first- and second-order motion perception that  recovered to normal within weeks. Previous human studies have shown either first- or  second n order motion deficits that have lasted months or years after cerebral  damage. SF also showed a transient defect in processing of shape-from-motion with  normal perception of shape from non-motion cues. Furthermore, she showed greatly  increased reaction times for a mental rotation task, but not for a lexical decision  task. The nature and quick recovery of the deficits in SF resembles the transient  motion perception deficit observed in monkey following ibotenic acid lesions, and  provides additional evidence that humans possess specialized cortical areas  subserving similar motion perception functions.

The present study investigates whether these sex differences in MRT scores can be explained in part by early spatial activity experience, particularly those spatial activities that have been sex-typed as masculine/male-oriented. Utilizing an online survey, 571 ethnically diverse adult university students completed a brief demographic survey, an 81-item spatial activity survey, and the MRT. Results suggest that the significant relation between sex of the participant and MRT score is partially mediated by the number of masculine spatial activities participants had engaged in as youth. Closing the gap between males and females in spatial ability, a skill linked to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics success, may be accomplished in part by encouraging female youth to engage in more particular kinds of spatial activities. © 2013 Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Voyer, Voyer, & Bryden, 1995). Mental rotation ability has been found to be enhanced with experience (Nazareth, Herrera & Pruden, 2013) and training (Wright, Thompson, Ganis, Newcombe, & Kosslyn, 2008) and the effects of training have been found to be transferable to other spatial tasks (Wright et al., 2008) and sustainable for months (Terlecki, Newcombe, & Little, 2008). Although, we now are fairly certain about the malleability of spatial tasks and the role of spatial activity experience, we seem to have undervalued an important piece of the puzzle. What is the mechanism by which experiential factors enhance mental rotation performance? In other words, what is it that develops in an individual as a consequence of experience? The current dissertation sought to address this gap in the literature by examining cognitive strategy selection as a possible mechanism by which experiential factors like early spatial activity experience enhance mental rotation performance. A total of 387 adult university students were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions. The three experimental conditions differed in the amount and type of non-spatial information present in the task stimuli. Participant eye movement was recorded using a Tobii X60 eye tracker. Study I investigated the different types of cognitive strategies selected during mental rotation, where eye movement patterns were used as indicators of the underlying cognitive strategies. A latent profile analysis revealed two distinct eye movement patterns significantly predicting mental rotation performance. Study II examined the role of early spatial activity experience in mental rotation performance. Male sex-typed spatial activities were found to significantly mediate the relation between participant sex and mental rotation performance. Finally, Study III examined the developmental role of early spatial activity experience in cognitive strategy selection and strategy flexibility to enhance mental rotation performance. Strategy flexibility was found to be significantly associated with mental rotation performance. Male sex-typed spatial activity experiences were found to be significantly associated with cognitive strategy selection but not strategy flexibility. Implications for spatial training and educational pedagogy in the STEM fields are discussed.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Psychonomic bulletin & review	https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-019-01633-6	There are inconsistent reports regarding behavioral sex differences in the human navigation literature. This meta-analysis quantifies the overall magnitude of sex  differences in large-scale navigation skills in a variety of paradigms and  populations, and examines potential moderators, using 694 effect sizes from 266  studies and a multilevel analytic approach. Overall, male participants outperform  female participants, with a small to medium effect size (d = 0.34 to 0.38). The type  of task, the type of dependent variable and the testing environment significantly  contribute to variability in effect sizes, although there are only a few situations  in which differences are either nonexistent or very large. Pointing and recall tasks  (and the deviation scores associated with them) show larger sex differences than  distance estimation tasks or learning to criterion. Studies with children younger  than 13 years showed much smaller effect sizes (d = .15) than older age groups. We  discuss the implications of these findings for understanding sex differences in  human spatial navigation and identify avenues for future navigation research.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2018.01.009	Developmental research beginning in the 1970s has suggested that children's ability to form cognitive maps reaches adult levels during early adolescence. However, this  research has used a variety of testing procedures, often in real-world environments,  which have been difficult to share widely across labs and to use to probe components  of mapping, individual differences in success, and possible mechanisms of  development and reasons for individual variation. In this study, we charted the  development of cognitive mapping using a virtual navigation paradigm, Silcton, that  allows for testing samples of substantial size in a uniform way and in which adults  show marked individual differences in the formation of accurate route  representations and/or in route integration. The current study tested children aged  between 8 and 16 years. In terms of components of normative development, children's  performance reached adult levels of proficiency at around age 12, but route  representation progressed significantly more quickly than route integration. In  terms of individual differences, by age 12 children could be grouped into the same  three categories evident in adults: imprecise navigators (who form only imprecise  ideas of routes), non-integrators (who represent routes more accurately but are  imprecise in relating two routes), and integrators (who relate the two routes and,  thus, form cognitive maps). Thus, individual differences likely originate during  childhood. In terms of correlates, perspective-taking skills predicted navigation  performance better than mental rotation skills, in accord with the view that  perspective taking operates on extrinsic spatial representations, whereas mental  rotation taps intrinsic spatial representations.

These infants received 10–14 10-min play sessions wearing “sticky mittens”: mittens with palms that stuck to the edges of toys and allowed the infants to pick up the toys. After these enrichment sessions, the experienced infants’ object engagement and object exploration skills were compared to those of infants who were the same age as the experienced infants but had not received the play sessions. The results showed that the experienced infants showed more object engagement via a number of measures, and showed more sophisticated object exploration strategies compared to their inexperienced peers. The results suggest that the early simulated experience reaching for objects serves to jump-start the process of object engagement in young infants.

In order to do this, people must situate the object in terms of different frames of reference, including body position (egocentric frame of reference), landmarks in the surrounding environment (extrinsic frame reference), or other attached features (intrinsic frame of reference). Nardini et al. hid a toy in one of 12 cups in front of children, turned the array when they were not looking, and then asked them to point to the cup with the toy. This forced children to use the intrinsic frame (information about the array of cups) to locate the hidden toy. Three-year-olds made systematic errors by using the wrong frame of reference, 4-year-olds were at chance, and only 5-and 6-year-olds were successful. Can we better understand the developmental change that takes place at four years? This paper uses a modelling approach to re-examine the data and distinguish three possible strategies that could lead to the previous results at four years: (1) Children were choosing cups randomly, (2) Children were pointing between the egocentric/extrinsic-cued location and the correct target, and (3) Children were pointing near the egocentric/extrinsic-cued location on some trials and near the target on the rest. Results heavily favor the last possibility: 4-year-olds were not just guessing or trying to combine the available frames of reference. They were using the intrinsic frame on some trials, but not doing so consistently. These insights suggest that accounts of improving spatial performance at 4 years need to explain why there is a mixture of responses. Further application of the selected model also suggests that children become both more reliant on the correct frame and more accurate with any chosen frame as they mature. © 2015 Negen, Nardini.

Spatial ability measured by test performance and spatial activity experience, i.e., children’s reports about unsupervised walks, effected pointing accuracy as well.

Research in developmental disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103960	BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience impaired social cognition. AIMS: In the present study, we aimed to  investigate the relation between visual-spatial abilities and theory of mind in  children and adolescents with and without ASD. METHODS: Forty-five boys from the age  of 7 to 17 years with ASD and thirty-one aged matched boys without ASD participated  and completed the test of intrinsic stable visual-spatial ability (test of visual  perceptual skill-revised), intrinsic dynamic visual-spatial ability (animal mental  rotation test), and theory of mind test (TOMT). RESULTS: Results showed that  relative to boys without ASD, boys with ASD had a lower performance in theory of  mind and intrinsic visual-spatial abilities. Secondly, theory of mind correlated  with visual-spatial abilities in boys with ASD. Theory of mind for first and second  order beliefs was predicted by the intrinsic dynamic visual abilities, whereas the  theory of mind ability of emotion recognition was predicted by visual-spatial static  abilities. In children without ASD, theory of mind for emotion recognition was  predicted by intrinsic visual-spatial ability and the theory of mind for first order  beliefs. DISCUSSION: Theory of mind can be predicted by visual-spatial abilities in  children and adolescents with ASD. Future studies should investigate the role of  different types of intrinsic dynamic visual-spatial abilities (e.g., egocentric vs.  object-based mental rotation tasks) in relation to different aspects of theory of  mind in children and adolescents with autism.

A technical note	Neuroradiology Journal	https://doi.org/10.1177/197140090702000204	Preoperative fMRI is one of the best established clinical fMRI applications. Due to the difficulties in recording and coregistration of functional image data, we present methods to standardize and automate these procedures. We used a self-made interactive software package (AFI - Automated Functional Imaging) to automate the time consuming and complex analysis of fMRI data. AFI controls the BrainVoyager program, a postprocessing software package, and furthermore facilitates data management, anonymization of patient data, storage, documentation, data export to neuronavigation systems and the opportunity of spatial transformation of image data for use in group studies. By the end of 2006 we have used this method on 123 patients with brain tumors and 47 patients with trigeminal neuralgia. The fundamental basis of multimodal neuronavigation is precise coregistration. EPI images contain spatial distortions of 5-15 mm. We were able to reduce the misregistration of EPI and FLASH images in a selectable region of interest to 1-2 mm. Furthermore AFI reduces the average evaluation time for a standard clinical fMRI study (four functional measurements, one anatomical data set) by approx. 50% from 140 minutes to about 70 minutes in comparison to manual evaluation by an expert. More importantly, the personal attendance time required for the evaluation decreases by 84% to 23 minutes as the remainder of the program runs automatically. In comparison to currently available online postprocessing software tools which are more limited in use, BrainVoyager can be used for coregistration, data export to neuronavigation systems and spatial transformation.

It was hypothesized that an auditory deprivation results in a deficient spatial orientation to the regions outside the visual field. This in turn should affect the actual localization behaviour to visual targets situated within those regions. Differences between the auditorially handicapped and non‐handicapped children were found with respect to the localization times of so‐called‘reversal’responses of eye (Experiment 1) and head (Experiment 2) to targets situated outside the field of view. In the second experiment significant age‐effects were present. The implications of these findings for the presence of specific differences in cognitive spatial abilities between auditorially handicapped and hearing children are discussed.

Correlations between IT and various subtests, scales and factors derived from WISC-R performance were generally statistically significant although there was no correlation between IT and a Spatial Ability factor. The uncorrected correlation between IT and Full Scale IQ was -0.5, with those children whose IQs were below the sample average contributing more to this outcome. Moreover, the IT-IQ correlation was higher among 12 children showing less well-directed attention in the IT task. Taken overall, IT appeared to be more related to a broad intellectual capacity reflecting attentional control processes, rather than to specific abilities. © 1989.

Influence of implicit gender stereotype activation and rotational axis on fourth graders' mental-rotation performance	Learning and Individual Differences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2014.09.003	Mental-rotation tasks usually induce large gender differences in favor of males. The influence of task features and stereotype activation on the mental-rotation performance of elementary-school children has rarely been investigated. This study examined the performance of 272 fourth-grade boys and girls in a psychometric mental-rotation task varying implicit gender-stereotype activation (threatening vs. non-threatening task framing) and rotational axis (picture-plane vs. in-depth rotations). Children's gender stereotypes were assessed by a questionnaire. Both genders showed a male stereotype for mental rotation. Implicit gender stereotype activation influenced the gender difference only in picture-plane mental-rotation tasks. Boys outperformed girls in the threatening condition, but not in the non-threatening condition, here. However, in-depth rotation tasks induced a significant male advantage in both the threatening and the non-threatening conditions. Findings suggest that a task framing relating mental rotation to arts induces a stereotype-lift effect and that the rotational axis moderates the effect of implicit gender-stereotype activation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

'Stereotype threat' affects the gender difference in adults’ mental-rotation performance (e.g., Moè & Pazzaglia, 2006). Our study investigated this effect in fourth graders. Two hundred sixteen males and females solved two mental-rotation tests. In between, a gender-difference instruction was given ('boys better,' 'girls better,' 'no gender difference'). A significant interaction of time and gender was found in the 'girls better'-condition and in the 'no gender difference'-condition: As expected, the male performance advantage disappeared after these two instructions, because girls improved and boys deteriorated. Thus, the study suggests that the gender effect in mental rotation is affected by stereotype threat and stereotype lift from the very beginning of its occurrence. Results are discussed within a biopsychosocial framework and seem to play an important role with regard to the 'hidden curriculum' in schools.

For some time, difficulties with such tasks have been thought to index a pervasive characteristic of children's thought, called “egocentrism,” but recent research has shown clearly that at least by 2 years of age, children are not egocentric in the sense of not knowing that other people see displays differently. This chapter provides the argument that perspective-taking tasks and other spatial problems, such as mental rotation, are difficult for reasons that include the demands the particular problem makes on the usual form of representation of space. From at least 5 years of age, and perhaps earlier, this representation seems to be one in which small movable targets are encoded in relation to a framework of fixed landmarks, rather than in relation to each other. Such coding makes ecological sense, because movable items, almost by definition, make poor reference points for the location of other objects. Thus, spatial coding does not seem to change across middle childhood in the fashion discussed by Piaget. What remains for the future is to explore whether frameworks of landmarks are used soon after the beginning of free locomotion, and how location coding changes, if it does, in the first few years of life. © 1989 Academic Press Inc.

In addition, they help reasoning in domains that are not obviously spatial, for example, through the use of graphs and diagrams. This article reviews the literature suggesting that mental spatial transformation abilities, while present in some precursory form in infants, toddlers, and preschool children, also undergo considerable development and show important individual differences, which are malleable. These findings provide the basis for thinking about how to promote spatial thinking in preschools, at home, and in children's play. Integrating spatial content into formal and informal instruction could not only improve spatial functioning in general but also reduce differences related to gender and socioeconomic status that may impede full participation in a technological society. © 2010 the Authors.

Because right hemispheric spatial abilities are essential for physical orientation in the world, childhood sufferers of NLD may avoid exploring. With limited spatial skills and experiential deprivation, they may fall behind peers in academics and social skills. Poor receptive and expressive prosody also commonly result and contribute to psychopathology. The socioemotional consequences of NLD involve anxiety and poor adaptive functioning. This study constructed the NewDelman Assessment of Learning Disabilities (NANoLD). The NANoLD scores of 98 community college students were compared to scores on the Spatial Relations subtest (SPREL) of the Woodcock-Johnson-R, the Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity (PONS), the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS), and the trait portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Form Y). The NANoLD significantly correlated with three instruments: the STAI, the TAS, and the SPREL. The strongest correlation was with the STAI $(r={-}.63).$ Several NANoLD factor scores also correlated with these same instruments. The four instruments used in the study accounted for 48% of the variance of the NANoLD. Surprisingly, the PONS did not correlate significantly with the NANoLD. The principal conclusion in this study is that with additional norming and research, the NANoLD may become an effective instrument to identify individuals with NLD. It may also become a useful instrument for differentiating anxiety disorders from anxiety secondary to learning disability.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry	https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp.57.8.967	Comprehensive, longitudinal neuropsychological assessments are reported in a person "at risk" from autosomal dominant, necropsy confirmed familial Alzheimer's disease.  The first assessment showed a moderately selective verbal memory deficit in the  context of mild general intellectual impairment. Subsequent testing showed the  progressive deterioration of visual memory and a mild decline of perceptual and  spatial skills. Language and literacy skills, however, remained comparatively  intact. The neuropsychological profiles obtained at each assessment are presented in  profile maps. These permit direct longitudinal comparison of cognitive function, and  may serve in the comparison of different potential cases of familial Alzheimer's  disease. This case sought medical attention for memory difficulties 26 months after  the first neuropsychological assessment. These results mark the first cognitive  manifestations in a pedigree with familial Alzheimer's disease which, in this case,  were seen presymptomatically. The findings are discussed in relation to  neuropsychological studies of affected cases, and in terms of their reflecting the  heterogeneous nature of familial Alzheimer's disease.

The current study examined a specific type of block play, structured block play in which a copy of a block configuration is constructed. Structured block play is a difficult cognitive task that requires an understanding of spatial relations, hand-eye coordination, and spatial working memory among others. This preliminary study was designed to determine whether training using structured block play would lead to improvements in skills linked to mathematical thinking. Two groups of children participated in the study. One group played a competitive structured block building game once a week for 8 weeks. A control group was also tested. All participants completed a kindergarten readiness assessment before and after the 8-week period. Children in the block play group showed significant improvements in the computation module of the assessment, showing improvements in the makes a set of objects smaller or larger skills. No such effect was observed for the control group. The results presented demonstrate that young children can, with assistance, engage in structured block play and that they have cognitive benefits from such block building activities. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01278	Previous studies have found that block play, board games, and puzzles result in better spatial ability. This study focused on examining the differential impact of  structured block play and board games on spatial processing. Two groups of  8-year-old children were studied. One group participated in a five session block  play training paradigm and the second group had a similar training protocol but  played a word/spelling board game. A mental rotation task was assessed before and  after training. The mental rotation task was performed during fMRI to observe the  neural changes associated with the two play protocols. Only the block play group  showed effects of training for both behavioral measures and fMRI measured brain  activation. Behaviorally, the block play group showed improvements in both reaction  time and accuracy. Additionally, the block play group showed increased involvement  of regions that have been linked to spatial working memory and spatial processing  after training. The board game group showed non-significant improvements in mental  rotation performance, likely related to practice effects, and no training related  brain activation differences. While the current study is preliminary, it does  suggest that different "spatial" play activities have differential impacts on  spatial processing with structured block play but not board games showing a  significant impact on mental rotation performance.

Journal of neuroendocrinology	https://doi.org/10.1111/jne.12698	Oestradiol is known to play an important role in the developing human brain, although little is known about the entire network of potential regions that might be  affected and how these effects may vary from childhood to early adulthood, which in  turn can explain sexually differentiated behaviours. In the present study, we  examined the relationships between oestradiol, cortico-amygdalar structural  covariance, and cognitive or behavioural measures typically showing sex differences  (verbal/spatial skills, anxious-depressed symptomatology) in 152 children and  adolescents (aged 6-22 years). Cortico-amygdalar structural covariance shifted from  positive to negative across the age range. Oestradiol was found to diminish the  impact of age on cortico-amygdalar covariance for the pre-supplementary motor  area/frontal eye field and retrosplenial cortex (across the age range), as well as  for the posterior cingulate cortex (in older children). Moreover, the influence of  oestradiol on age-related cortico-amygdalar networks was associated with higher word  identification and spatial working memory (across the age range), as well as higher  reading comprehension (in older children), although it did not impact  anxious-depressed symptoms. There were no significant sex effects on any of the  above relationships. These findings confirm the importance of developmental timing  on oestradiol-related effects and hint at the non-sexually dimorphic role of  oestradiol-related cortico-amygdalar structural networks in aspects of cognition  distinct from emotional processes.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361320949352	When answering how the same object might appear to others in different locations, people can provide answers by mentally putting themselves into another person's  location using the embodied self-rotation strategy or by rotating the target object  toward themselves using the object-based mental rotation strategy. In this study,  after learning the embodied self-rotation or object-based mental rotation  strategies, autistic children improved their visual perspective-taking performance,  which is believed to be impaired or delayed in autistic individuals. We recruited 34  autistic children and an equal number of ability-matched typical children and  examined their visual perspective-taking performance at baseline and after learning  the embodied self-rotation and object-based mental rotation strategies. As previous  visual perspective-taking and other social cognition interventions for autistic  individuals have primarily focused on the embodied self-rotation strategy, showing  moderate effectiveness and limited generalizability, we explored the effects of both  embodied self-rotation and object-based mental rotation strategies for improving  perspective-taking performance and discussed their implications in this study. The  results showed that autistic children had a lower performance at baseline compared  with typical children; however, they were still sensitive to both embodied  self-rotation and object-based mental rotation strategies. Unlike typical children,  who gained more from the embodied self-rotation strategy, autistic children  benefited similarly from the two strategies. This suggests that there are multiple  ways to helping autistic children overcome their difficulty in perspective-taking  tasks. Future interventions for autistic children could consider combining various  strategies that better suit their autistic traits.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of abnormal child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1022614407893	Despite interest in early neuropsychological status as a possible contributor to children's behavioral development, prospective longitudinal investigations of  neuropsychological measures in relation to later behavioral outcomes in childhood  are few. A 2-year longitudinal study in a nonselected childhood sample is reported.  The study tested the influence of early neuropsychological performance (verbal  fluency, mental inhibitory control, and visual spatial ability) on later childhood  behavioral problems and social competency. Regular education children (n = 235) were  assessed at three time points 1 year apart. To control for autocorrelation of  outcome measures, Time 1 behavior was partialed while testing the effects of Time 1  neuropsychological scores on Time 3 outcome. To control for autocorrelation of  neuropsychological scores, Time 2 scores were partialed while testing the predictive  effect of Time 1 scores on Time 3 outcome. Both sets of regression models suggested  modest but statistically significant effects for inhibitory control and verbal  fluency, but not IQ, reading, or visual spatial ability, on behavioral outcome.  Study results are consistent with a modest causal effect of selected  neuropsychological skills on later behavioral adjustment. The findings support  theories that implicate subtle neuropsychological dysfunction in the development of  behavioral problems in childhood.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This phenomenon has been linked traditionally to childhood risk factors (e.g. deficient education, abuse and neglect). Substantial discrepancies between performance intelligence quotients (PIQ) and verbal intelligence quotients (VIQ), however, might also point to neurobiological impairments which may be associated with specific types of criminal behaviour. From the files of 133 male hospitalized offenders, PIQ, VIQ, full scale IQ (FSIQ) scores and Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (PCL-R) scores were derived, along with information about their criminal histories. PIQ over VIQ discrepancies were most pronounced in sexual offenders, particularly in those who had committed sexual crimes against adult victims. Furthermore, PIQ as well as PIQ higher than VIQ discrepancies correlated modestly, but significantly, with PCL-R scores. The results suggest that lower verbal compared to visual and spatial abilities may be connected specifically to egocentric and narcissistic personality traits which, in turn, may be involved in raising the risk of sexual offending. © 2009, National Organisation for the Treatment of Abusers.

Simulation can also be used to enhance reality by adding features normally not available in the real world. The aim with this work has been to develop and evaluate methods that could improve learning in oral radiology utilising a radiation-free simulator environment.    Virtual reality software for radiographic examinations was developed. The virtual environment consisted of a model of a patient, an x-ray machine, and a film. Simulated radiographic images of the patient model could be rendered as perspective projections based on the relative position between the individual models. The software was incorporated in an oral radiology simulator with a training program for interpretation of spatial relations in radiographs. Projection geometry was validated by comparing length dimensions in simulated radiographs with the corresponding theoretically calculated distances. The results showed that projection error in the simulated images never exceeded 0.5 mm.    Dental students participated in studies on skill in interpreting spatial information in radiographs utilising parallax. Conventional and simulator based training methods were used. Training lasted for 90 minutes. Skill in interpreting spatial information was assessed with a proficiency test before training, immediately after training, and eight months after training. Visual-spatial ability was assessed with mental rotations test, version A (MRT-A). Regression analysis revealed a significant (P<0.01) association between visual-spatial ability and proficiency test results after training. At simulator training, proficiency test results immediately after training were significantly higher than before training (P<0.01). Among students with low MTR-A scores, improvement after simulator training was higher than after conventional training. Eight months after simulator training proficiency test results were lower than immediately after training. The test results were, however, still higher than before training.    In conclusion, the simulation software produces simulated radiographs of high geometric accuracy. Acquisition of skill to interpret spatial relations in radiographs is facilitated for individuals with high visual-spatial ability. Simulator training improves acquisition of interpretative skill and is especially beneficial for individuals with low visual-spatial ability. The results indicate that radiology simulation can be an effective training method.	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

Nature neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.3983	Socioeconomic disparities are associated with differences in cognitive development. The extent to which this translates to disparities in brain structure is unclear. We  investigated relationships between socioeconomic factors and brain morphometry,  independently of genetic ancestry, among a cohort of 1,099 typically developing  individuals between 3 and 20 years of age. Income was logarithmically associated  with brain surface area. Among children from lower income families, small  differences in income were associated with relatively large differences in surface  area, whereas, among children from higher income families, similar income increments  were associated with smaller differences in surface area. These relationships were  most prominent in regions supporting language, reading, executive functions and  spatial skills; surface area mediated socioeconomic differences in certain  neurocognitive abilities. These data imply that income relates most strongly to  brain structure among the most disadvantaged children.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A matching completion task consisting of three geometric figures and one bird-like figure were completed by children 3-5 years of age (N = 99). The rotation effect, in which the correct response decreased with orientation (45 , 90 135 , and 180 ), was confirmed, except in one of the geometric conditions. We found that two factors were needed for a child to perform the bird-like completion task: clarification of the reference to each stimulus and awareness of the turning orientation. These studies suggest that the children processed the contour and feature information individually, and that the contour information was processed earlier than the feature information. We derived three criteria for sensitive information to resolve the task, contact, contour, and left-right. Findings are discussed with regard to the reference action and the part-whole relationship. © The Author(s) 2013.

Many studies suggest that the hand is a key factor in solving these tasks. In this study a mental rotation task and a manipulative task were conducted with 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children. The index of the mental rotation task was response time (RT), and the manipulative task used a plate corresponding to the sight of a stimulus on an LCD monitor. Results showed that six kinds of strategies were employed by mental rotators and non-mental rotators. The manipulative strategies used for the matching of a hand-turned object were interpreted as a visually guided action and important for identification of an object's contours and features. © 2010 Psychology Press.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.107.2.419-438	Object identification in perceptual tests may include constituents of mental rotation. A matching-to-sample task was conducted with same or different objects to  look for evidence of rotation. Elementary schoolchildren (6 to 8 years old) in  Grades 1 to 4 (N = 264) participated, using the inclined Flags Test and the Water  Level Test to ensure that children can use kinematic imagery for the Flags Test even  if they used static imagery for the Water Level Test. Performance on the inclined  Flags Test varied by age group. Use of implicit mental rotation of the inclined  object was inferred in recognition. Also, children at the pre-operational stage  showed a rotational effect, i.e., they could transform the object by turning it,  thereby confirming kinematic imagery is used from age 6. As a consequence, solving  both rotation tasks may require not only recognition of object frames but also  objects internal to the frame.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The recent computational focus suggesting aberrant Bayesian inference in ASD has yielded promising but conflicting results in attempting to explain a wide variety of phenotypes by canonical computations. Here, we used a naturalistic visual path integration task that combines continuous action with active sensing and allows tracking of subjects' dynamic belief states. Both groups showed a previously documented bias pattern by overshooting the radial distance and angular eccentricity of targets. For both control and ASD groups, these errors were driven by misestimated velocity signals due to a nonuniform speed prior rather than imperfect integration. We tracked participants' beliefs and found no difference in the speed prior, but there was heightened variability in the ASD group. Both end point variance and trajectory irregularities correlated with ASD symptom severity. With feedback, variance was reduced, and ASD performance approached that of controls. These findings highlight the need for both more naturalistic tasks and a broader computational perspective to understand the ASD phenotype and pathology. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

During the follow-up examination, enzyme activity was assessed in fibroblasts to evaluate the uniformity of biochemical deficits. The biochemical findings demonstrated profound deficits of leukocyte α-mannosidase that remained remarkably stable over time and were very similar to levels of the same enzyme activity in fibroblasts. The cognitive findings showed that the patients manifested mild cognitive deficits. Cognitive deficits were generally uniform with no signs of progressive deterioration, except receptive language abilities.

The ICICLE-PD study was established to define the characteristics and prevalence of cognitive change soon after diagnosis, in a representative cohort of patients, using a multimodal approach. Specifically, we tested the 'Dual Syndrome' hypothesis for cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, which distinguishes an executive syndrome (affecting the frontostriatal regions due to dopaminergic deficits) from a posterior cortical syndrome (affecting visuospatial, mnemonic and semantic functions related to Lewy body pathology and secondary cholinergic loss). An incident Parkinson's disease cohort (n = 168, median 8 months from diagnosis to participation) and matched control group (n = 85) were recruited to a neuroimaging study at two sites in the UK. All participants underwent clinical, neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance imaging assessments. The three neuroimaging tasks (Tower of London, Spatial Rotations and Memory Encoding Tasks) were designed to probe executive, visuospatial and memory encoding domains, respectively. Patients were also genotyped for three polymorphisms associated with cognitive change in Parkinson's disease and related disorders: (i) rs4680 for COMT Val158Met polymorphism; (ii) rs9468 for MAPT H1 versus H2 haplotype; and (iii) rs429358 for APOE-ϵ2, 3, 4. We identified performance deficits in all three cognitive domains, which were associated with regionally specific changes in cortical activation. Task-specific regional activations in Parkinson's disease were linked with genetic variation: the rs4680 polymorphism modulated the effect of levodopa therapy on planning-related activations in the frontoparietal network; the MAPT haplotype modulated parietal activations associated with spatial rotations; and APOE allelic variation influenced the magnitude of activation associated with memory encoding. This study demonstrates that neurocognitive deficits are common even in recently diagnosed patients with Parkinson's disease, and that the associated regional brain activations are influenced by genotype. These data further support the dual syndrome hypothesis of cognitive change in Parkinson's disease. Longitudinal data will confirm the extent to which these early neurocognitive changes, and their genetic factors, influence the long-term risk of dementia in Parkinson's disease. The combination of genetics and functional neuroimaging provides a potentially useful method for stratification and identification of candidate markers, in future clinical trials against cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease. © The Author (2014).

Maltreated boys were hypothesized to have poorer neurocognitive functioning than maltreated girls, and nonmaltreated boys and girls, in all neurocognitive domains, particularly pertaining to executive function and attention. We also examined correlations between cognitive function and parent report of child behavior problems for maltreated and nonmaltreated children. Results: Maltreated boys performed more poorly on measures of intelligence, attention, language, memory, executive function, and academic achievement in both reading and math than nonmaltreated boys. Maltreated boys did not perform more poorly on these cognitive measures or behavioral measures than maltreated girls, except for one memory measure. Maltreated girls performed more poorly on measures of intelligence, language, memory, executive function, and academic achievement than nonmaltreated girls. Maltreated girls with better visual-spatial skills had more internalizing and externalizing problems. Effect sizes for these sex differences ranged from small to large. Conclusions: Both maltreated boys and girls showed poorer cognitive function than their nonmaltreated sex-matched controls. Maltreated girls had subtle sparing of attention and short-term memory (STM). Understanding sex differences in neurocognitive functioning may have implications for designing large population studies of maltreated youth.

We know that sport activity improves motor skills. The aim of this work is to determine if these gender differences exist in young athletes. The orientation test described by Terzi and standardized by Cesaroni, used to measure spatial ability, was carried out on 60 volleyball or 60 tennis athletes as well as on 60 non-sporting subjects. Results: The data analysis revealed a worse performance for non-athletes in comparison with athletes in both components of test (p < 0.0001; p = 0.04), with no differences between the volleyball and tennis groups. As far as gender comparison is concerned, as expected in the non- sport group the males presented better values (p < 0.001; p = 0.006). However in both sports groups there weren't any gender differences in either part of the test (p = 0.18; p = 0.056). Conclusions: These results confirm that during athletic preparation in volleyball and tennis the specific training is able to develop spatial ability. Besides, boys and girls have similar performance demands and training experience. It appears that this specific training could be responsible for modifying gender differences in performance of spatial ability during adolescence. © 2014 Notarnicola et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

Research in developmental disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2014.01.026	It has been hypothesized that the underlying mechanism of clumsy motor behaviour in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) is caused by a deficit in  the internal modelling for motor control. An internal modelling deficit can be shown  on a behavioural level by a task that requires motor imagery. Motor imagery skills  are suggested to be related to anticipatory action planning, but motor imagery and  action planning have not been tested within the same child. In the present study,  action planning and motor imagery skills were assessed in 82 children between 7 and  12 years of age. Twenty-one of these children met the criteria for DCD, which was  assessed by the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development and 56 of these  children were used in the control group. Motor imagery was tested by a mental  rotation task of hands that were shown from a back and palm point of view. The  results show that motor imagery is affected in children with DCD but only in  conditions with complex task constraints (i.e., rotation of hand stimuli presented  in palm view). These results provide partial support for the internal modelling  deficit hypothesis. We were not able to elicit motor planning deficits in this  group, however, and argue that more complex planning tasks may be needed to identify  such deficits.

Journal of the neurological sciences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2015.08.1537	BACKGROUND: Natalizumab therapy reduces inflammation and degeneration of the CNS in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the  concentration of 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24OHC) reflect neurodegeneration, whereas  27-hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) is dependent on the integrity of the blood-brain  barrier (BBB). OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact from natalizumab treatment on 24OHC  and 27OHC concentrations in serum and CSF of RRMS. METHODS: In serum and CSF  obtained from 31 patients before and following 12 months of natalizumab treatment,  24OHC and 27OHC were analyzed by isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. RESULTS:  Natalizumab treatment reduced CSF-24OHC concentrations (p=0.002), CSF-27OHC  concentrations (p=0.01) and serum-24OHC concentrations (p=0.029). There was no  significant effect of the treatment on serum-27OHC concentrations. Serum  concentrations of 24OHC correlated with Symbol Digit Modalities Test scores before  (r=0.5, p=0.007) and after natalizumab treatment (r=0.403, p=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: We  showed for the first time that natalizumab treatment of RRMS reduced the  concentrations of 24- and 27OHC in CSF, indicating reduced neurodegeneration and  improved integrity of the BBB, respectively. Our results imply a role for serum  24OHC as a biomarker of cognition (visuo-spatial ability and processing speed) in  RRMS.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The main clinical characteristics are typical faces, supravalvular aortic stenosis, failure to thrive, short stature, transient neonatal hypercalcemia, delayed language, friendly personality, hyperacusis and intellectual disability. The diagnosis of SWB is confirmed by the detection of micro deletion by different techniques of molecular cytogenetics, FISH, MLPA or polymorphic markers. This study assessed the verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and performance and visuospatial skills in children and adults with WBS. The composed group was of 31 WBS patients (19 M and 12 F), whose ages ranged from 9 to 26 years (M 14.45 y). All patients had the diagnosis confirmed molecularly. The tests used were the WISC-III, WAIS-III and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test. The results indicated a total IQ ranged from 51 to 86 (M 63): 22 with mild intellectual disability, 4 with moderate intellectual disability, 4 borderlines and 1 below the normal media. All patients had marked visual-spatial deficits. The results suggest nonverbal reasoning, visuo-spatial perception, spatial representation, working memory, motor planning and executive functions are very affected in this group.

An experiment is described in which 72 pupils from Abidjan (Ivory Coast) and 79 from Matran (Switzerland) responded to a computerized mental rotation task. When compared to classical studies, results show, for both groups, similar patterns of reaction times (RTs) across degrees of rotation. RTs, however, are significantly longer in Ivorean children, and for the Swiss (only) they decrease with age. Results do not entirely match the postulated linearity of the relationship between reaction time and degree of rotation, in particular at 30 and 330 degrees, for which RTs are longer than expected. Data also show that incorrect answers do not occur randomly, suggesting that the widely used criterion of RT based on correct responses only should be reconsidered. No gender differences were found.

It focuses on how children (aged 6, 8, and 10 years) and young adults (n = 79) indicate, recognize, and bind landmarks and directions in both verbal and visuo-spatial tasks after learning a virtual route. Performance in these tasks is also related to general verbal and visuo-spatial abilities as assessed by independent standardized tests (attention, working memory, perception of direction, production and comprehension of spatial terms, sentences and stories). The results first show that the quantity and quality of landmarks and directions produced and recognized by participants in both verbal and visuo-spatial tasks increased with age. In addition, an increase with age was observed in participants’ selection of decisional landmarks (i.e., landmarks associated with a change of direction), as well as in their capacity to bind landmarks and directions. Our results support the view that children first acquire landmark knowledge, then route knowledge, as shown by their late developing ability to bind knowledge of directions and landmarks. Overall, the quality of verbal and visuo-spatial information in participants’ spatial representations was found to vary mostly with their visuo-spatial abilities (attention and perception of directions) and not with their verbal abilities. Interestingly, however, when asked to recognize landmarks encountered during the route, participants show an increasing bias with age toward choosing a related landmark of the same category, regardless of its visual characteristics, i.e., they incorrectly choose the picture of another fountain. The discussion highlights the need for further studies to determine more precisely the role of verbal and visuo-spatial knowledge and the nature of how children learn to represent and memorize routes. © Copyright © 2015 Nys, Gyselinck, Orriols and Hickmann.

Many neuroimaging studies have demonstrated mental rotation to be mediated primarily by the parietal lobes, particularly on the right side. Here, we use fMRI to show for the first time that when performing 3-dimensional mental rotations, mathematically gifted male adolescents engage a qualitatively different brain network than those of average math ability, one that involves bilateral activation of the parietal lobes and frontal cortex, along with heightened activation of the anterior cingulate. Reliance on the processing characteristics of this uniquely bilateral system and the interplay of these anterior/posterior regions may be contributors to their mathematical precocity. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Particular attention was paid to auditory language function, praxis,  visuo-spatial skills, body schema, tactile defensiveness and inattention. The side  of the hemiplegia was not found to predispose to any specific dysfunction, with the  exception of inattention which was seen only in those with left-sided hemiplegia.  Children with a history of familial sinistrality had a higher incidence of speech  problems, particularly in the area of auditory language and speech delay. The  results are discussed in the light of therories of plasticity and cerebral  organization.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Children > 5 years	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00925.x	Many studies report chronic deficits in visual processing in children born preterm. We investigated whether functional abnormalities in visual processing exist in  children born preterm but without major neuromotor impairment (i.e. cerebral palsy).  Twelve such children (< 33 weeks gestation or birthweight < 1000 g) without major  neuromotor impairment and 12 born full-term controls were assessed at 8-12 years of  age by means of ophthalmological assessment (visual acuity, colour vision,  stereopsis, stereoacuity, visual fields, ocular motility, motor fusion), cognitive  tests of visual-motor, visual-perceptual and visual-spatial skills and  pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (PR-VEPs). All participants also underwent  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and neuromotor assessments. No  significant differences were found between the groups on the ophthalmological,  visual cognitive, neurological, neuromotor or MRI measures. The P100 component of  the PR-VEP showed a significantly shorter latency in the preterm compared with the  full-term participants. Whilst this P100 finding suggests that subtle abnormalities  may exist at the neurophysiological level, we conclude that visual dysfunction is  not systematically associated with preterm birth in the context of normal  neurological status.

It is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to identify, recruit, and test infants. As a result, ours is a field of small sample sizes. Many studies using infant looking time as a measure have samples of 8–12 infants per cell, and studies with more than 24 infants per cell are uncommon. This paper examines the effect of such sample sizes on statistical power and the conclusions drawn from infant looking-time research. An examination of the state of the current literature suggests that most published looking-time studies have low power, which leads in the long run to an increase in both false positive and false negative results. Three data sets with relatively large samples (>30 infants) were used to simulate experiments with smaller sample sizes; 1,000 random subsamples of 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 infants from the overall samples were selected, making it possible to examine the systematic effect of sample size on the results. This approach revealed that despite clear results with the original large samples, the results with smaller subsamples were highly variable, yielding both false positive and false negative outcomes. Finally, a number of emerging possible solutions are discussed.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

In each experiment, 4- or 6-month-old infants were familiarized with a collection of dogs or cats and then their response to novel dogs and cats was assessed. In Experiment 1, 4-month-old infants responded to the exclusive distinction of dogs or cats when tested in a paired-comparison task. In Experiments 2 and 3, 6-month-old infants, but not 4-month-old infants, responded to this same distinction in a successive presentation task, even when the amount of familiarization was equated to that of the paired comparison task. Therefore, familiarization with a particular set of stimuli does not induce infants to respond to a single category but rather they respond to different categories depending on features of the task.

There is a dearth of measures of spatial language, especially those that focus on a specific type of word. This dissertation introduces three studies, using two measures of dimensional adjective comprehension, one in English and one in Spanish. Study one found that bilingual children’s knowledge of dimensional adjectives in one language is not predictive of their performance on dimensional adjectives in the other language, but that general vocabulary within a language predicts performance in that language. This study also showed that within a pair of polar opposite terms (e.g., long and short) children are more likely to know the term describing the big dimension and not the small dimension than vice versa. The second study found that the number of dimensional concepts children comprehend predicts how well they perform on a spatial scaling test, controlling for age and general vocabulary. The final study failed to find a link between dimensional adjective knowledge and performance on the children’s mental transformation task. These findings might have important implications for early education, showing that supporting children’s understanding of language might have an impact on their spatial reasoning.

Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1076/jcen.24.1.82.966	The present study investigated right-left discrimination, with a paper-and-pen test using line figures. The test consists of line drawings of a person with no, one, or  both arms crossing the vertical body axis of the figure. The subjects' task is to  mark with a pencil, as fast as possible, which is the right or left hand in the  figure. The line drawings are either viewed from the back, from the front, or  randomly alternating between the back and front views. The sample consisted of 322  male and female subjects, split into four different groups, from children to old  adults. The results showed increasing performance from children to young adults,  with a decline in performance in the old adults (>50 years). The condition with  alternating front-back views was the most difficult, particularly when the figure  also had both arms crossing the vertical body midline. There were no gender  differences except for better male performance in the young adults group (18-22  years). The results are discussed in relation to theories of mental rotation and  lateralization of information processing strategies, in addition to right-left  discrimination across the age groups.

Tracking the rotational displacements of containers and hidden objects is a particularly challenging task. This study investigated the ability of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-year-old children and great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) to (a) visually track rotational displacements of a baited container on a platform and (b) infer its displacements by using the changes of position or orientation of 3 landmarks: an object on a container, the color of the containers, and the color of the platform on which the containers rested. Great apes and 5-year-old and older children successfully tracked visible rotations, but only children were able to infer the location of a correct cup (with the help of landmarks) after invisible rotations. The ability to use landmarks changed with age so that younger children solved this task only with the most explicit marker on the baited container, whereas older children, particularly 9-year-olds, were able to use landmark orientation to infer correct locations.

One of the topics that may allow students to develop their spatial skills is forming 3-dimensional objects using spinning and extrusion methods. Also, extrusion and spinning methods provide an important basis on advanced mathematical topics (e.g., calculus ideas related to solids of revolution). A 3-dimensional geometric topic often studied by children in grades K-12 is volume with a focus on students’ spatial abilities. Researchers demonstrated the process of students’ finding the volume of a rectangular prism to be length * width * height. However, this formula cannot be generalized to cones, cylinders, etc. On the other hand, there is little research about forming 3-dimensional objects by spinning or extruding 2-dimensional figures.   The purpose of this study is to understand how middle school students enrolled in a summer program reason about the volume of 3-dimensional objects using extrusion and spinning while utilizing manipulatives and a dynamic geometry program, Cabri 3D. The research design is a case study (Stake, 1995; 2005) in which the data are collected from a bounded system – a summer enrichment program. Eight middle school students (three rising seventh grade students, and five rising eighth grade students) participated in the research study. A five-day instructional unit was planned in which activities were created, so students produces a variety of signs (e.g., gesture, drawing, verbal sign) during they reasoned about the semiotic activities. Throughout the instruction, students were given hands-on materials and their corresponding Cabri 3D sketches. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Although these variables have been studied before in relation to field dependence-independence, the effect of general intelligence on this perceptual measure within the context of these other independent variables has not yet been studied. What differences in field dependence-independence performance are manifested in terms of gender or handedness after intelligence has been taken into account?    Since field dependence-independence is purported to crystallize at puberty or about 14 or 15 years of age, high school students aged 16 years and older and enrolled in the 11th and 12th grades were tested in this study. The Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT), a measure of field dependence-independence, and the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, a measure of handedness, were administered to the students one month before the end of the school year. The Differential Aptitude Test (DAT) composite score for Verbal Reasoning and Numerical Ability (VR + NA) was used as a measure of general intelligence, and the DAT Space Relations test was used as a measure of spatial ability. These DAT test scores were collected from the students' eighth-grade records.    Descriptive analyses, analysis of covariance, and multiple regression were used to examine the effects of the predictor variables on GEFT performance. T-tests were also performed to study the differential effects of handedness, grade, and gender on the measures.    The data analyses of both the multiple regression and the analysis of covariance revealed that there were sex differences related to GEFT performance even after general intelligence had been taken into account. Besides general intelligence and sex, spatial ability also proved to be a significant variable in the final equation. Neither handedness nor the sex and handedness interaction had a significant relationship to GEFT performance in either analysis.	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In an exploratory study, nine nonretarded teenagers with FAS were administered tests of IQ and adaptive behavior, and neuropsychological tests presumed sensitive to alcohol effects. Their performance was compared with psychometric norms and to data from a sample of 174 adolescents with minimal or no prenatal alcohol exposure. These nonretarded FAS patients commonly showed behavior problems, decreased social competence, and poor school performance. Neuropsychological testing revealed significant deficits, although no one neuropsychological profile characterized all patients and not all tests revealed problems. Relatively intact performance was observed in procedural memory, some measures of reaction time, and some reading measures. Deficits were seen on attentional and memory tasks tapping visual-spatial skills, short-term auditory attention and memory, declarative learning, and cognitive flexibility and planning. Difficulties in processing speed and accuracy were also seen. Comparison with a subgroup of 52 nonalcohol-exposed or minimally alcohol-exposed adolescents with a similar range of IQ scores demonstrated that deficits among these FAS patients were not fully explained by a general lowering of IQ.

In December and May, 21 4-year-olds completed the NLE task (0-10 range) and measures of numerical knowledge, spatial skills, and visual-motor integration.  With high-quality teaching, children made large gains in these skills (d = 0.96-1.28).  Due to uniformly high achievement, few expected correlations were observed, however.  A strategy account of NLE performance was supported over the traditional logarithmic-to-linear shift account and the newly proposed proportion-judgement account.   Patterns of error in estimation provide a better indication of understanding of the linear number line than models of best fit.  Indeed, interpreting linearity of NLE as indicative of an underlying representation of number could lead to inappropriate conceptualizations of math learning disabilities and misguided interventions.

In Time 1, the level of TV exposure was measured, and six kinds of cognitive skills were measured in Time 1 and Time 2. Path analyses were conducted to examine whether the amount of Time 1 TV viewing could predict the level of Time 2 cognitive skills. As a result, longer Time 1 TV viewing predicted higher Time 2 spatial skills and lower Time 2 linguistic skills' scores. Also, longer educational programme viewing predicted higher score of social rules' comprehension, which is one of the sub-skills in Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). © Copyright © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

Methods: Twenty-seven children operated for craniopharyngioma and their parents participated in the study. Cognitive functions were assessed with WISC-R/WAIS-R-PL and Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test. Parents completed Achenbach's Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) questionnaires on problems in functioning and psychopathological symptoms and took part in an interview on children coping in everyday life. Results: Eighty-two percent of patients were diagnosed with an average level of intellectual functioning. No child received results indicating mental disability. In half of the children, effectiveness of visual memory was reduced, despite normal visual-spatial abilities. The results in the CBCL scale indicated more frequent presence of psychopathological symptoms - especially social problems, depression, anxiety and withdrawal. The most frequent problems in children's everyday functioning included inability to control emotions, difficulties in learning, unsatisfactory peer relationships, and unattractive appearance resulting from hormonal disorders (short height and obesity). One third of parents also reported problems with pathological appetite in their children. Conclusions: Despite normal intellectual abilities and relatively good physical condition, children after removal of craniopharyngioma experience many difficulties in everyday life regarding social relationships, emotion control and learning. The analogy between the above-mentioned symptoms and symptoms observed in patients after infantile damage in the frontal area leads to an observation that, apart from endocrine disorders, damage to the frontal lobe caused by the growth of tumour and operational intervention is of crucial importance to the further development of children with craniopharyngioma. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

H.; Jolles, Jelle	2014	journalArticle	The relation between children's constructive play activities, spatial ability, and mathematical word problem-solving performance: a mediation analysis in sixth-grade  students.	Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00782	The scientific literature shows that constructive play activities are positively related to children's spatial ability. Likewise, a close positive relation is found  between spatial ability and mathematical word problem-solving performances. The  relation between children's constructive play and their performance on mathematical  word problems is, however, not reported yet. The aim of the present study was to  investigate whether spatial ability acted as a mediator in the relation between  constructive play and mathematical word problem-solving performance in 128  sixth-grade elementary school children. This mediating role of spatial ability was  tested by utilizing the current mediation approaches suggested by Preacher and Hayes  (2008). Results showed that 38.16% of the variance in mathematical word  problem-solving performance is explained by children's constructive play activities  and spatial ability. More specifically, spatial ability acted as a partial mediator,  explaining 31.58% of the relation between constructive play and mathematical word  problem-solving performance.

Behavioural neurology	https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/6530539	BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) affects up to 4% of a pediatric population, with many comorbidities in the medium-long term. Functional alterations  in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may explain why OSAS impacts aspects such as  executive functions, memory, motor control, attention, visual-spatial skills,  learning, and mood regulation. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a complex  neuropsychological function that could be impaired in many clinical conditions.  PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to evaluate the difference in emotional  intelligence skills among children with OSAS and healthy subjects (nOSAS). METHODS:  129 children (72 males; mean age 7.64 ± 1.98 years) affected by OSAS were compared  to 264 non-OSAS (nOSAS) children (138 males; mean age 7.98 ± 2.13) similar for  gender, age, and socioeconomic status. In order to assess the emotional quotient,  the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth Version (EQ-i:YV) was used. RESULTS:  The comparison for means and standard deviation between OSAS children and nOSAS  children for EQ-i:YV scores showed significant differences for Interpersonal,  Adaptability, and Stress Management scales and EQ Total score. CONCLUSIONS: Our  findings highlighted the role of intermittent hypoxia in the genesis of the effects  of sleep-related respiratory disorders, which involves also aspects different from  physical impairments.

The population for this study was sixth and eighth graders. Two groups of each grade level were used--one in a small town of approximately 1,500 and the other in a community of around 25,000. Both are in Wyoming. The sample group consisted of a total of 94 students.    The CDAT provides totals for four subtests plus a composite score and the TVPS three subtest totals plus a sum of raw scores. Raw data were used as this study was meant to be criterion referenced. Following the receipt of data, tests were coded for year, student identification number, age, and grade. The TVPS was scored locally and the CDAT by a rater for the publisher. Descriptive information portrayed the average student as female, age 13 years one month, with low-moderate drawing ability and high spatial ability. Mitigating factors may have skewed this picture. Correlational analysis and canonical correlation as well as other appropriate tests were used to answer the research questions. This form of research does not identify a cause and effect relationship as descriptive designs do not lead to causality. However, a degree of predictability was hoped for as a result of the canonical correlation.    The results of the data analysis showed no relationship or predictability between drawing ability and spatial ability. T-tests revealed no differences between males and females on any drawing or spatial ability subtests. There appeared to be a significant relationship between age and the spatial test for visualization. However, the r indicating the strength of the relationship was very low. The t-test for significant differences between males and females on this test indicated boys and girls were equally affected. As males and females get older their spatial visualization improves. A negative correlation was found for age and all drawing tasks. This supports Dr. Clark's findings that younger subjects may out-perform older.    Other results verified the independent nature of the subtests of the TVPS. Each test measures distinctly different perceptual skills. The CDAT scores were highly correlated, also in agreement with Dr. Clark, verifying all are equally effective in measuring drawing skill.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The International journal of neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1916489	PURPOSE: Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is a common manifestation of sepsis that may lead to cognitive decline. Our aim was to investigate whether the  neurofilament light chain (NFL) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid  cells 2 (sTREM2) could be utilized as prognostic biomarkers in SAE. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: In this prospective observational study, baseline serum levels of sTREM2  and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of sTREM2 and NFL were measured by ELISA in 11  SAE patients and controls. Patients underwent daily neurological examination. Brain  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and standard electroencephalography (EEG) were  performed. Cognitive dysfunction was longitudinally assessed after discharge in 4  SAE patients using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Addenbrooke's  Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) tests. RESULTS: SAE patients showed higher CSF  sTREM2 and NFL levels than controls. sTREM2 and NFL levels were not correlated with  the severity measures of sepsis. Three months after discharge, 2 SAE patients  displayed ACE-R scores congruent with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), persisting in  one patient 12 months after discharge. SAE patients with MCI showed higher CSF NFL  levels, bacteremia, and abnormal brain MRI. Patients with increased serum/CSF sTREM2  levels showed trends towards displaying poorer attention/orientation and  visuo-spatial skills. CONCLUSIONS: sTREM2 and NFL levels may serve as a prognostic  biomarker for cognitive decline in SAE. These results lend further support for the  involvement of glial activation and neuroaxonal degeneration in the physiopathology  of SAE.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A placebo‐controlled study	Journal of Internal Medicine	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2796.1994.tb01061.x	Abstract. Objectives. The aim of the investigations was to study the effect of a combined selenium and vitamin E treatment in patients with myotonic dystrophy. Design. A double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial. Subjects. Twenty‐seven patients with myotonic dystrophy divided into an experimental (n = 13) and a control (n = 14) group. Interventions. The experimental group was given increasing doses for 4 months up to a maximum of 1.6 mg selenium and 800 mg vitamin E daily and the control group a corresponding number of placebo tablets. The total treatment period was 2 years. Main outcome measures. Muscle strength (knee extension, knee flexion, hand‐grip), maximal walking speed for 30 m, function in daily activities (disability), well‐being and cognitive functioning. Results. Before treatment, muscle strength showed moderately or markedly reduced values as did maximal walking speed. Disability was most markedly demonstrated in instrumental ADL‐activities. Spatial ability was reduced in the majority of patients. During the 2‐year follow‐up period, the hand‐grip strength and maximal walking speed decreased in both groups (P < 0.01). The reduction was not significantly different according to an ‘intention‐to‐treat‐analysis’. However, there was a significantly larger decline (P < 0.01) in the left‐hand grip strength in the control group when all the patients with complete treatment compliance were included. Conclusions. A useful set of measurements has been developed for following functional deterioration in myotonic dystrophy. No conclusive evidence of beneficial effects of selenium and vitamin E treatment has been produced. 1994 Blackwell Publishing Ltd	ASK	0	0	0	1	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		4	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

Children of 20, 30, and 40 months of age were either presented with two objects with different cross-sections and one aperture, or one object and two different apertures. In each trial there was one object-aperture match and the task was to find that match and insert the object. All the children understood the task and tried to solve the problems but the 20-month-olds performed randomly and not even the 40-month-olds chose all the correct correspondences consistently. The results also showed that it is easier to choose between apertures than objects. This contrasts with the ability to solve the insertion problem once the choice was made. When choosing the correct object or aperture, the 40-month-olds inserted the triangle successfully in 85% of the cases. The boys and girls were equally good at solving the task, but the boys did it faster. The results show that making a choice adds significantly to the difficulty of solving spatial problems. It requires systematic examination of the objects and apertures involved, a working memory that can handle at least three items at a time, and an ability to inhibit an incorrect choice. Such executive functions are typically found in older preschool children but the present task shows that with an appropriate setup their development can be traced from a much earlier age. © 2008 Psychology Press.

The task was to insert objects with various cross-sections (circular, square, rectangular, ellipsoid, and triangular) into fitting apertures. A successful solution required the infant to mentally rotate the object to be fit into the aperture and use that information to plan the action. The object was presented standing up in half of the trials; in the other half, it was lying down. The results showed that infants solved the problem consistently from age 22 months and that a successful solution was associated with appropriate preadjustments before the hand arrived with the block to the aperture.

Participants were 29 children enrolled in beginning music instruction, and 29 children matched in age and gender attending preschool, without formal music lessons. The children were assessed on a music perception task (melody recognition) and a variety of cognitive measures (receptive vocabulary, visual-motor integration, an embedded figures task, and puzzles), prior to beginning music instruction and four months later. The results indicated that preschool children taking music lessons may be a select group; they were more likely to have previous musical experience and additional extra-curricular activities. After four months of music lessons, children in the music group showed the greatest improvement on the music task. A transfer effect was observed primarily for visual-motor skills, with the music group improving significantly on the visual-motor integration task. The findings are discussed as relevant to previous research. Implications for music education are also discussed. © 1999 by the Society for Research in Psychology of Music and Music Education.

Bratislavske lekarske listy		There are suggestive data with indicate the link of testosterone levels with specific cognitive abilities in humans. As soon as during intrauterine development,  testosterone is supposed to influence to organization of fetal specific brain  structures. This influence is permanent and it is reflected in cognitive abilities  during prepubetal period. In puberty, the testosterone level rapidly increases  mainly in boys and it appears to influence the definitive development of cognitive  functions. In this paper, results of the first four years of our logitudinal study  are presented. Salivary testosterone levels in children were determined, and their  effect on spatial ability was studied. Radioimmunoanalytical method of testosterone  determination in saliva was developed, since saliva reflects free fraction of  testosterone directly available for uptake by receptors in the central nervous  system. The sampling of saliva is non-invasive and unstressful, which is important  for relevant evaluation of cognitive performance. One hundred and forty-seven  children (78 boys and 69 girls) at the ae of 8 to 12 were examined. The data  received from intellectually gifted children attending the School for gifted  children in Bratislava (100 measurements) were compared with the data received from  age-matched children attending randomly chosen elementary schools (151  measurements). Lower salivary testosterone levels were found in intellectually  gifted children of both sexes, and negative relationship between testosterone levels  and cognitive abilities in preadolescent children was observed.

Optimal organization of brain structures responsible for visuospatial abilities in humans depends on testosterone exposure during early stages of ontogenic development. Testosterone influence on 2-dimensional spatial cognition in prepubertal children was studied. We compared two groups of children: gifted boys and girls (N = 81) from experimental classes of elementary school (mean age 6 years) and control group of normal boys and girls (N = 70) from elementary school (mean age 7.5 years). Testosterone concentrations were measured in saliva, since obtaining saliva is a noninvasive, unstressful procedure, best for investigating young children. The results showed significantly lower testosterone levels in gifted children compared to the control group (p < 0.005). Gifted children reached better performance in spatial-reasoning tests and in this group of children testosterone levels negatively correlated with cognitive performance.

This study was designed to describe infradian variations in testosterone levels in saliva collected during one month and to identify relationships between salivary testosterone and spatial abilities in 53 young healthy volunteers of both sexes. Our results showed the effect of testosterone on spatial performance. In accordance with general knowledge, men with higher average testosterone levels scored better than women. A circalunar rhythm of testosterone related to the menstrual cycle with the highest testosterone concentration in the periovulatory period was confirmed in women and an analogical circalunar cycle was described in men. Negative relationships between testosterone levels and spatial abilities were found in men whereas positive relationships between these parameters were found in women. When spatial perfomance was related to monthly testosterone variations in both sexes, it was found that, in women, the periovulatory testosterone peak was associated with the best spatial performance while, in men, the high testosterone phase was associated with the worst spatial performance. The understanding of infradian variations in testosterone levels and their effects on cognitive abilities in humans may be important in terms of clinical implications.

Specifically, we asked whether children’s intelligence involves both general and specific aspects and whether standard ToM measures of false belief can serve as indicators of social intelligence. Psychometric intelligence and children’s domain-specific understanding of number concepts and of mental states (false belief) were measured in the laboratory; communication and social skills were assessed through mothers’ report. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed poor fit for a one-factor model, but good fit for a model with three correlated factors, suggesting that children’s intelligence involves both general and specific aspects. Numerate-spatial and verbal intelligence were correlated (.70), and social intelligence correlated to a stronger degree with verbal (.66) than with numerate-spatial intelligence (.37). Laboratory assessment of false belief and mothers’ reports about children’s social skills loaded on a single factor, pointing to real-world consequences of ToM abilities. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? The structure of intelligence in 4-year-olds comprises domain-general and domain-specific dimensions. Some domain-specific dimensions are numerate-spatial, verbal, and social intelligence. What does this study add? Theory of Mind emerges as an aspect of children’s social intelligence. Social intelligence (including Theory of Mind) is related to children’s numerate-spatial abilities. © 2020 The Authors.

We enrolled 54 non‐demented hypothyroid patients (31–99, mean 68.6 ± 16.4 years) with biochemical evidence of hypothyroidism (38 had overt and 14 had minimal hypothyroidism) and 30 euthyroid controls (31–96, mean 63.7 ± 18.4 years) screened for good general health. We evaluated attention, orientation, memory, learning, visual‐spatial abilities, calculation, language, visual scanning, and motor speed using standardized neuropsychological tests. Electrophysiological measures of neurocognitive function included the P300 latency component of the auditory Event‐Related Potentials (ERP) and conduction speed from eye to cortex, the P100 latency component of the Patterned Visual‐Evoked Potential (PVEP). All patients were studied when hypothyroid. A subset of patients with minimal initial test abnormalities were available to be retested when euthyroid, 5 and 9 months after onset of thyroid replacement therapy. Hypothyroid patients showed significantly lower scores on the Mini‐Mental Status Test (MMS) and on five of 14 neuropsychological tests as compared to controls. The neuropsychological tests affected were copying a cube (visual‐spatial function), the Inglis Paired Associates Learning Test‐Low and Medium association items (memory and learning), Animal Naming (word fluency/production), and the Trail Making A test (attention, visual scanning and psychomotor function. Hypothyroidism also was associated with longer P100 latencies of PVEPs to 20‘ checks, but showed no significant differences in PVEP P100 latency to 50‘ checks, nor in the latency of the auditory ERP component P300. There was a statistically significant correlation between a laboratory index of the severity of hypothyroidism (serum T4) and the Inglis Medium Association items and Animal Naming. There was a statistically significant improvement after 5 months of treatment on three of the timed performance tests that previous studies have shown to be most sensitive to brain dysfunction. Hypothyroidism in non‐demented older adults is associated with impairments in learning, word fluency, visual‐spatial abilities, and some aspect of attention, visual scanning, and motor speed. The MMS by itself was sensitive in differentiating hypothyroid patients with cognitive deficits from controls, while electrophysiological measures did not generally differentiate the hypothyroid patients from normal controls. The MMS was not sensitive to treatment effects, but treatment was associated with significant improvements in three of the most sensitive measures of cognitive dysfunction. © 1992 The American Geriatrics Society	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Through active exploration of affordances, which are possibilities for action defined by the child’s (motor, cognitive and other) skills and the environment, children are thought to develop spatial skills over time. In the current paper, we review the state of the evidence for this theoretical mechanism with respect to the early development of spatial memory, spatial orientation, spatial process and spatial language in typically developing young children. We conclude that the knowledge base to date supports the notion that active exploration plays a key and specific role in spatial cognition. The evidence supports the idea that spatial cognition is grounded in daily physical interactions between children and their environment. We further discuss open questions and point directions for future research. © Presses Universitaires de France. Tous droits réservés pour tous pays.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00521	Various studies have shown that occurrence of locomotion in infancy is correlated with the development of spatial cognitive competencies. Recent evidence suggests  that locomotor experience might also be important for the development of spatial  language. Together these findings suggest that locomotor experience might play a  crucial role in the development of linguistic-cognitive spatial skills. However,  some studies indicate that, despite their total deprivation of locomotor experience,  young children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have the capacity to acquire and  use rich spatial representations including good spatial language. Nonetheless, we  have to be cautious about what the striking performances displayed by SMA children  can reveal on the link between motor and spatial development, as the dynamics of  brain development in atypically developing children are different from typically  developing children.

The computer programs utilized were developed by a neuropsychologist to remediate visual-spatial skills in a clinical setting.    Subjects were 10 elementary school students, ranging in age from 7 to 11. The research design selected was a pretest-posttest-delayed posttest matched control group design. In addition, four of the subjects, two randomly selected from the treatment group and two from the control group, were administered the written version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test daily, with each subject treated as a separate time-series design.    All 10 subjects were administered the Performance Scale of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and the Simultaneous Processing Scale of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) as pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest measures. Treatment for the five subjects in the experimental group consisted of 20 sessions of using computer programs designed to remediate visual-spatial skills.    The research questions to be answered in this study called for making effect size comparisons between the pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest measures, as well as examining the time-series data. Significant effect sizes were not found, and the results of the time-series design were inconsistent.    However, change score data indicated that the treatment group as a whole gained 15 more WISC-R Performance Scale IQ points than did the control group. WISC-R subtests showing greater change for the treatment group when pretest to delayed posttest individual change scores were compared were the Picture Completion and Picture Arrangement subtests. No difference was found in change score data between the two groups for the K-ABC Simultaneous Processing Score. Individual change scores from pretest to delayed posttest scores indicated more improvement for the treatment subjects for the Triangles, Spatial Memory, and Photo Series subtests, with the largest difference occurring on the Triangles subtest.

Spatial visualization ability in females was correlated with verbal IQ and various aspects of personality. These relations were absent in males. Within each sex, measures of cognitive abilities obtained in childhood predicted spatial visualization ability at age 18. Hypotheses designed to explain the sex difference in spatial visualization must be sensitive to the different implications of this factor in males and females. © 1987 American Psychological Association.

We confirmed high rates of attention and activity level problems, which were described previously. Nine of the 11 patients met criteria for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The boys did not manifest autistic behavior, and none met criteria for an autism spectrum disorder, though their parents reported substantial repetitive behavior. The personalities of the participants often were described as friendly, good-natured, and cheerful, but they did not differ empirically on a standardized measure of personality structure from typically developing comparison children, even after controlling for the effects of IQ. Specifically, higher rates of agreeableness and extraversion were not confirmed, though these constructs do not correspond perfectly with the traits of affability and gregariousness described in earlier published case studies of FG syndrome. In terms of neuropsychological assessment, the boys had relatively less developed language, fine motor, and executive function skills, and visual-spatial abilities were a relative strength. Limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of neurosurgery	https://doi.org/10.3171/jns.1989.70.5.0707	As survival rates have risen for children with malignant primary brain tumors, so has the concern that many survivors have significant permanent cognitive deficits.  Cranial irradiation (CRT) has been implicated as the major cause for cognitive  dysfunction. To clarify the etiology, incidence, and severity of intellectual  compromise in children with brain tumors after CRT, a prospective study was  undertaken comparing the neuropsychological outcome in 18 consecutive children with  malignant brain tumors treated with CRT to outcome in 14 children harboring brain  tumors in similar sites in the nervous system who had not received CRT. Children  with cortical or subcortical brain tumors were not eligible for study.  Neuropsychological testing was performed after surgery prior to radiotherapy, after  radiotherapy, and at 1- and 2-year intervals thereafter. Children who had received  CRT had a mean full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) of 105 at diagnosis which  fell to 91 by Year 2. Similar declines were noted in their performance intelligence  quotient (IQ) and verbal IQ. After CRT, patients demonstrated a statistically  significant decline from baseline in FSIQ (p less than 0.02) and verbal IQ (p less  than 0.04). Children who had not received CRT did not demonstrate a fall in any  cognitive parameter over time. The decline between baseline testing and testing  performed at Year 2 in patients who had CRT was inversely correlated with age (p  less than 0.02), as younger children demonstrated the greatest loss of intelligence.  Children less than 7 years of age at diagnosis had a mean decline in FSIQ of 25  points 2 years posttreatment. No other clinical parameter correlated with the  overall IQ or decline in IQ. After CRT, children demonstrated a wide range of  dysfunction including deficits in fine motor, visual-motor, and visual-spatial  skills and memory difficulties. After CRT, children with brain tumors also  demonstrated a fall in a wide range of achievement scores and an increased need,  over time, for special help in school. The 2-year results of this study suggest that  children with brain tumors treated with CRT are cognitively impaired and that these  deficits worsen over time. The younger the child is at the time of treatment, the  greater is the likelihood and severity of damage. These children, although not  retarded, have a multitude of neurocognitive deficits which detrimentally affects  school performance. New treatment strategies are needed for children with malignant  brain tumors.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Quantitative and qualitative measures of achievement, cognitive skills, classroom behavior, and diagnosis were used to further explore and validate statistically obtained subtypes. One hundred ninety-three learning disabled (LD), attention deficit (ADD), and hyperactive (ADHD) children who had been evaluated at a child development clinic at a major county hospital were selected according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Diagnoses of LD were validated using IQ-achievement discrepancy criteria, scores having been standardized. Only 117 children could be included in cluster analyses because of missing data. After dropping six outliers, the remaining 111 children were grouped via hierarchical cluster analysis into five clusters containing 64, 20, 7, 7, and 13 members. The clusters were titled Flat Profile, Impaired Attention/Sequencing Ability, Impaired Spatial Ability/Attention, Impaired Verbal Ability, and Impaired Verbal Ability/Sequencing. Internal validity of the clusters was supported using WISC-R factor scores and discriminant function analyses. Ninety-three percent of the children were correctly placed using the four obtained functions. Differences in Woodcock-Johnson, Raven Matrices, and Bender Gestalt scores among clusters generally supported external validity of the clusters. Two of the clusters included more ADD children than expected. Teacher reported classroom behavior via a Conners checklist was elevated for the entire sample and did not discriminate between groups. Results are discussed in terms of the no-deficit group, the importance of the Digit Span subtest, implications for ADD as a handicapping condition and the limited utility of the WISC-R in the diagnosis of LD and ADD.

The present investigation aimed to clarify the effects of NGF and to identify factors liable to induce different behavioral outcomes. Behavioral effects were assessed following a postsurgical delay of five months using various parameters: food consumption in a novel environment, spontaneous activity, locomotion in an open-field, immobility in a tail suspension test, spontaneous alternation in a T-maze and performance in a radial light-arm maze. Possible influence of intrahippocampal sympathetic fiber ingrowth occurring after septal lesions was ruled out, as the comparison of rats subjected to superior cervical ganglia removal with their lesion-control counterparts showed few behavioral differences, ven after NGF administration. All lesioned rats showed reduced adaptability in most of these tests. Grafts partially reversed the lesion-induced leficit in spontaneous alternation. A single intracerebral NGF injection was found to ameliorate radial maze performance, whether rats were rafted or not. However, it appeared that the number of strategies available to NGF-rats in the radial maze task was as limited as for esion-control rats. These findings suggest that NGF-rats do not recover spatial abilities lost after septal lesions, but are able to make more efficient use of remaining capacities to master the maze task. © 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02127	Background: Although several excellent reviews and meta-analyses have investigated the effect of video game trainings as tools to enhance well-being, most of them  specifically focused on the effects of digital games on brain plasticity or  cognitive decline in children and seniors. On the contrary, only one meta-analysis  results to be focused on the adult population, and it is restricted to examining the  effects of training with a particular genre of games (action video games) on  cognitive skills of healthy adults. Objectives: This systematic review was aimed to  identify research evidences about the impact on cognitive [i.e., processing and  reaction times (RTs), memory, task-switching/multitasking, and mental spatial  rotation] and emotional skills of video games training in the healthy adult  population. Methods: A multi-component analysis of variables related to the study,  the video games, and the outcomes of the training was made on the basis of important  previous works. Databases used in the search were PsycINFO, Web of Science (Web of  Knowledge), PubMed, and Scopus. The search string was: [("Video Games" OR "Computer  Games" OR "Interactive Gaming")] AND [("Cognition") OR ("Cognitive") OR ("Emotion")  OR ("Emotion Regulation")] AND ["Training"]. Results: Thirty-five studies met the  inclusion criteria and were further classified into the different analysis'  variables. The majority of the retrieved studies used commercial video games, and  action games in particular, which resulted to be the most commonly used, closely  followed by puzzle games. Effect sizes for training with video games on cognitive  skills in general ranged from 0.06 to 3.43: from 0.141 to 3.43 for processing and  RTs, 0.06 to 1.82 for memory, 0.54 to 1.91 for task switching/multitasking, and 0.3  to 3.2 for mental spatial rotation; regarding video games for the training of  emotional skills, effect sizes ranged from 0.201 to 3.01. Conclusion: Overall,  findings give evidences of benefits of video games training on cognitive and  emotional skills in relation to the healthy adult population, especially on young  adults. Efficacy has been demonstrated not only for non-commercial video games or  commercial brain-training programs, but for commercial video games as well.

One subtest of the Leiter-R, Form Completion, involves synthesizing and localizing a visual figure from its constituent slices. Form Completion poses an interesting nonverbal problem that seems to combine several aspects of visual memory, mental rotation, and visual search. We describe a new computational cognitive model that addresses Form Completion using a novel, mental-rotation-friendly image representation that we call the Polar Augmented Resolution (PolAR) Picture, which enables high-fidelity mental rotation operations. We present preliminary results using actual Leiter-R test items and discuss directions for future work. Copyright © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

database	Panter-Brick, C.	2002	journalArticle	Sexual division of labor: Energetic and evolutionary scenarios	American Journal of Human Biology	https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.10074	This article examines comparative energetic data on hunter-gatherers in the context of evolutionary scenarios of the sexual division of labor, with respect to both specific task allocation and overall levels of daily physical activity. The division of labor between men and women, well marked in contemporary foraging societies, was once posited as the "true watershed" for the evolution of the genus Homo. Some research on brain-wiring even links sex differences in cognitive and spatial abilities to sex-specific foraging activities. Most recent evolutionary arguments posit that men focus on hunting and women on gathering activities to realize potentially conflicting mating and parenting goals. A range of cooperative strategies (male/female and female/female) for child provisioning is also under investigation. Attention to energetic and reproductive trade-offs has usefully challenged the proposition that women are excluded from big-game hunting due to constraints of foraging ecology and reproduction. Simplistic assumptions about gender roles are thus increasingly questioned in anthropology, as well as in archaeology. Current models in behavioral ecology explore ways in which foraging practices vary with ecological circumstances, aiming to derive testable hypotheses from fine-grained data on the behavior of contemporary hunter-gatherers. Data on overall physical activity levels (PAL) can also serve to evaluate relative male/female workloads in modern groups, reconstruct hominid energy requirements and activity profiles, and examine changes with subsistence intensification. Male/female PAL ratios show that a task-specific division of labor does not readily extrapolate to 24-hour energy expenditure and that male/female differences in workloads were not necessarily reduced with the transition to agriculture. With respect to gender roles and PAL, a shift away from facile stereotypes of human behavior is evident. The challenge is to incorporate a range of behavioral responses to ecological circumstances in reconstructions of our evolutionary past. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Behavioural brain research	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.01.024	Previous studies have demonstrated that children with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) exhibit deficits in measures of eye movement control that probe  aspects of visuospatial processing and working memory. The goal of the present study  was to examine, in a large cohort of children with FASD, prenatal alcohol exposure  (PAE) but not FASD, and typically developing control children, the relationship  between performance in eye movement tasks and standardized psychometric tests that  assess visuospatial processing and working memory. Participants for this dataset  were drawn from a large, multi-site investigation, and included children and  adolescents aged 5-17 years diagnosed with an FASD (n=71), those with PAE but no  clinical FASD diagnosis (n=20), and typically developing controls (n=111).  Participants completed a neurobehavioral test battery and a series of saccadic eye  movement tasks. The FASD group performed worse than controls on the psychometric and  eye movement measures of working memory and visuospatial skills. Within the FASD  group, digit recall, block recall, and animal sorting were negatively correlated  with sequence errors on the memory-guided task, and arrows was negatively correlated  with prosaccade endpoint error. There were no significant correlations in the  control group. These data suggest that psychometric tests and eye movement control  tasks may assess similar domains of cognitive function, and these assessment tools  may be measuring overlapping brain regions damaged due to prenatal alcohol exposure.  The results of this study demonstrate that eye movement control tasks directly  relate to outcome measures obtained with psychometric tests and are able to assess  multiple domains of cognition simultaneously, thereby allowing for an efficient and  accurate assessment.

They were then divided into three experimental groups, and re-administered the task with or without instructions. The first group completed the task using gradually specific instructions until the participants performed each item to criterion level. The number of instructions needed to perform to criterion level was recorded (training scores). The second group completed the task with traditional training where the correct answer was demonstrated. The third group completed the task without feedback. After a month, all of the participants were given a post-test consisting of the square water bottle task, as well as a verticality task that required a related principle. Children's pre- and post-test performance scores were classified into six stages. It was found that there was a significant sex difference in the pretest performance of the horizontality task beginning at 8 years of age. The graduated training group evidenced higher stage scores on the post-test than the demonstration group and the control group. The former demonstrated a more integrated understanding of stable external reference frames compared to the other groups.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of deaf studies and deaf education	https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.deafed.a014288	This study investigated whether deafness contributes to enhancement of visual spatial cognition independent of knowledge of a sign language. Congenitally deaf  school children in India who were born to hearing parents and were not exposed to  any sign language, and matched hearing controls, were given a test of digit span and  five tests that measured visual spatial skills. The deaf group showed shorter digit  span than the hearing group, consistent with previous studies. Deaf and hearing  children did not differ in their performance on the visual spatial skills test,  suggesting that deafness per se may not be a sufficient factor for enhancement of  visual spatial cognition. Early exposure to a sign language and fluent sign skills  may be the critical factors that lead to differential development of visual spatial  skills in deaf people.

Two hundred forty-one second, third, and fourth graders from the United States and from China performed three mental addition tasks (addition of single-digits, double-digits, and numbers in word formats) and one task on mental rotation. Another group of 229 students from the third and fourth grades in the United States and the second and third grades in China participated in an addition task and also completed a pencil-and-paper diagnostic math test.    Chinese students were faster at all the mental addition tasks than were U.S. students in the same grades. Chinese second graders were faster than U.S. third graders at single digit addition and Chinese fourth graders were faster than U.S. fifth graders at the same task. Children from both countries were highly accurate at single-digit addition, less accurate at double-digit addition, and least accurate when adding double-digit numbers in word formats. Chinese subjects were significantly less accurate than American subjects when adding numbers written as words. Stepwise regression analysis predicting diagnostic test scores from addition speed indicated that as subjects became increasingly skilled at arithmetic their addition speeds contributed most significantly to more complex portions of the math exam.    Speed of mental rotation did not differ significantly between children from the two countries although Chinese subjects made remarkably more mistakes at that task. Implications of these results are discussed in terms the questions posed above.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Functional alterations in prefrontal cortex (PFC) may explain why OSAS impacts aspects such as: executive functions, memory, motor control, attention, visual-spatial skills, learning and mood regulation. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a complex neuropsychological function that could be impaired in many clinical conditions. Aim of the study is to evaluate the difference in emotional intelligence skills among children with OSAS and healthy subjects Materials and methods: 29 children (16 males) mean age 9.5 ± 1.54 years, affected by OSAS were compared with 60 typical developing children similar for gender (p = 0,871), age (p = 0,934) and socio-economic status (p = 0.714). Bar-On emotional quotient inventory, youth version (EQ-i: YV) was used in order to assess the Emotional Quotient. Results: Apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) results to be 8.76 ±3.45 with medium desaturation index (ODI) amounting to 2:52 ± 21.5, average saturation 92.7±4.8 %, average desaturation 4.9 %. OSAS children have significant differences in Interpersonal scales (84.95 ± 07.03 vs. 99.61 ± 8.96; p <0.001), Adaptability (7:36 ± 79.61 vs. 101.32 ± 9.4; p <0.001), Stress Management (72.48 ± 8.14 vs. 98.44 ± 5.19, p <0.001), QE Total (81.28 ± 11.03 vs. 102.14 ± 9.62; p <0.001). Pearson correlation analysis shows an inverse relationship between QE total and ODI (p <0.01). Conclusion: Our findings tend to highlight the role of intermittent hypoxia in OSAS effects genesis, involving also aspects different from physical impairments.

In an attempt to respond to this need, this study was designed: (a) to conduct a systematic search for cognitive-academic subtypes using a multivariate classification system, (b) to determine the degree of homogeneity of the identified subtypes, and (c) to compare those subtypes by age and learning disabled (LD)/non-handicapped (NH) classification.    For these purposes, Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis technique was applied to five variables (WISC-R Verbal IQ, Performance IQ, and three WRAT subtest scores) for 355 LD and 376 NH students, who were referred at the ages of 6 through 15 for psychoeducational evaluation. Subjects were clustered for three combined samples and six separate samples by age (6-8, 9-11, & 12-15) and classification (LD & NH). The degree of homogeneity of the identified subtypes was examined through split-sample replication and concordance across different clustering methods. To examine the effects of age and LD/NH classification, total percentages of students in clusters with each pattern or level were compared across samples. The relationships among subtype, age group, and LD/NH were also examined.    Results yielded eight distinctive LD subtypes from the LD combined and three LD age samples. The two most commonly reported subtypes were identified: (a) higher visual-spatial ability than verbal ability with higher arithmetic than reading/spelling, which appeared to be idiosyncratic to the LD group, and (b) higher verbal ability than visual-spatial ability with higher reading/spelling than arithmetic. The mixed deficit type in both abilities was not replicated. Three other subtypes were identified which conformed to previous research. Another three were subtypes which have not been addressed in previous research. Internal validation results consistently showed moderate stabilities across various samples. Significant relationships appeared between clusters and age groups, and between clusters and LD/NH classification. Differences in clustering results were also observed between the LD or NH total sample and samples by age.    The results of this study support the view that the LD population is heterogeneous, and that reading or arithmetic disability can be identified with different patterns of abilities.

Behavior genetics	https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01067703	Regressions of offspring on midparent value for tests of specific cognitive abilities in Korea were considerably higher than those for Americans of Japanese  ancestry or Americans of European ancestry tested in Hawaii. This greater  parent-offspring resemblance in Korea may be due to the particular method of test  administration or to an increased genetic variance resulting from assortative  mating. The pattern of parent-child correlations for three relatively pure tests of  spatial ability and for the spatial factor did not conform to that of a sex-linked  recessive character.

Roberts proposed a developmental model which predicted a child's success with the 0 degree heading first, the 90 and 270 degree headings second, and the 180 degree heading next. He insisted that children use the mental rotation strategy which is based on the mental image theory: the relative difficulty of making correct judgements is increased with an increase in the amount of angular separation of the turtle from the child's own orientation.    On the other hand, Lehrer and Littlefield found that children are successful with 180 degrees before they master the oblique headings of 135 and 225 degrees. Olson and Bialystok explained this oblique heading effect by using the coding complexity hypothesis.    The proposed model in this study was elaborated based on Roberts' hypothesized developmental model through inclusion of oblique orientations as well as orthogonal orientations. In this model, it was accepted that children use mental rotation strategy which is based on the propositional theory: the relative difficulty of making correct judgements would increase not only with an increase in the amount of angular separation of the turtle from the child's own orientation, but also with an increase in the amount of information required to describe the turtle's orientation.    Based on this assumption, it was expected that the order among orientations arranged from least to most difficult would fall into the following pattern: 0, the average of 90 + 270, 180, the average of 45 + 315, and the average of 135 + 225. Children's response patterns supported Roberts' theory. The order among orientations shown by children from least to most difficult was the following: 0, the average of 45 + 315, the average of 90 + 270, the average of 135 + 225, and 180.    Children's abilities to identify the turtle's left and right sides at different orientations were significantly improved during the two Logo treatment sessions. The second graders gave more correct left-right judgements than the first graders or kindergartners. However, this was not true for the performance between the first graders and kindergartners. Finally, the older children performed at the higher levels than did younger children.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Kindergardener group presumably > 3.0 years	3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The DAS is an individually administered, standardized test of intelligence. The stated purposes of the DAS are to provide a composite measure of conceptual reasoning abilities for classification and placement decisions and to provide a reliable profile of relative strengths and weaknesses for diagnostic purposes. With these goals in mind, it follows that this cognitive measure would be used often with mentally handicapped students.    The DAS was developed using an hierarchical model based upon exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The model assumes that ability measures or subtests will load on a general factor g and will form subfactors at a lower level. The model also assumes that as children get older, the number of subfactors will increase because of development and differentiation of abilities. How mentally handicapped children would fit into this model was the subject of the current research.    Using a sample of 100 mildly and moderately handicapped children ages 8 years, 0 months to 17 years, 5 months, confirmatory factor analysis was used to explore the factor structure of the DAS with this population. Three separate models were investigated: Model I, in which a one factor solution was proposed, Model II, in which two factors, Verbal Ability and Nonverbal Ability, were proposed, and Model III, in which three factors, Verbal Ability, Nonverbal Reasoning Ability, and Spatial Ability, as proposed by the test's authors, were investigated. Results of the analyses support the use of a one factor interpretation when using the DAS with mentally handicapped students. In practice, only the broadest score, the General Conceptual Ability Score (GCA), can be interpreted with confidence. Further, case study investigation illustrates the inconsistencies encountered in scoring at the lower end of the norms, as well as in using the out-of-level procedure proposed by the test's authors.

To what extent such effects exist at low-to-moderate doses is unclear. Considering the increasing exposure of the general population to low-to-moderate levels of IR, predominantly from diagnostic procedures, the study of these effects has become a priority for radiation protection. Objectives: We conducted a systematic review of the current evidence for possible effects of low-to-moderate IR doses received during gestation, childhood and adolescence on different domains of neurodevelopment. Data sources: Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and Psychinfo on the 6th of June 2017 and repeated in December 2018. Study eligibility criteria: We included studies evaluating the association between low-to-moderate IR doses received during gestation, childhood and adolescence, and neurodevelopmental functions. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies were evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration′s risk of bias tool adapted to environmental sciences. A qualitative synthesis was performed. Results: A total of 26 manuscripts were finally selected. Populations analyzed in these publications were exposed to the following sources of IR: atomic bomb (Hiroshima and Nagasaki), diagnostic/therapeutic radiation, and Chernobyl and nuclear weapon testing fallout. There was limited evidence for an association between low-to-moderate doses of IR and a decrease in general cognition and language abilities, that is, a causal interpretation is credible, but chance or confounding cannot not be ruled out with reasonable confidence. Evidence for a possible stronger effect when exposure occurred early in life, in particular, during the fetal period, was inadequate. Evidence for an association between IR and other specific domains, including attention, executive function, memory, processing speed, visual-spatial abilities, motor and socio-emotional development, was inadequate, due to the very limited number of studies found. Limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings: Overall, depending on the domain, there was limited to inadequate evidence for an effect of low-to-moderate IR doses on neurodevelopment. Heterogeneity across studies in terms of outcome and exposure assessment hampered any quantitative synthesis and any stronger conclusion. Future research with adequate dosimetry and covering a range of specific neurodevelopmental outcomes would likely contribute to improve the body of evidence.

database	PASS, RAYMOND	1980	thesis	THE EFFECTS OF VERBAL JUSTIFICATION OF ANSWERS, AND A NONVERBAL ATTENTION FOCUSSING TECHNIQUE ON RAVEN COLOURED PROGRESSIVE MATRICES PERFORMANCE IN MILDLY LANGUAGE DISORDERED AND NORMAL CHILDREN		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effects-verbal-justification-answers-nonverbal/docview/303022154/se-2?accountid=11531	There are two main research areas which provide background for the present study. The Raven Progressive Matrices tests have come to be widely used in diagnostic clinical neuropsychological examinations as a measure of visual-spatial perception. They have also been frequently used in research applications with various clinical and normal populations. There have been statements in the literature implicating a verbal as well as a visual-spatial perceptual loading on the tests in terms of internal verbal mediation useful (some say necessary) in the solution of the matrix problems. It has been demonstrated that adult aphasic patients perform worse on the tests than non-aphasic left brain damaged patients. Another area of research germane to the present study is that of developmental patterns of verbal mediation, and mediational deficits in children. Two competing models are the "mediational deficiency hypothesis" which states that there is a period in human cognitive development in which verbal mediation does not aid problem solving, whether spontaneously supplied or artificially stimulated, and the "production deficiency hypothesis" which states that young children don't use verbal mediation because they don't produce it (but can make use of it if shown how to produce it). The present study used mildly language disordered, and normal, children to study both the nature of the language disorder in terms of a "competence/performance" dichotomy, and also the role of verbal mediation in solving the Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM). Two groups of children (language disordered = ld, control; n = 60/group), controlled for nonverbal visual-spatial ability, were administered the CPM twice. The first administration was per standard instructions for all children. For the second administration, each group was split into three subgroups. One subgroup received a second standard CPM ("standard"); one subgroup was asked to verbally justify their answers for each item ("verbal"); one subgroup had its attention to each problem focussed by a passive nonverbal method. Results were as follows:  (a) The ld children scored significantly lower than the control children on Raven1. (b) Within the ld group, those in the "verbal" condition scored significantly greater RDELTA scores (Raven2 - Raven1) than those in either the "standard" or the "focus" conditions, who in turn did not score differently from each other. (c) Within the control group, those in the "standard" condition scored significantly lower than those in either the "verbal" or the "focus" conditions, who in turn did not score differently from each other. (d) There were no differences in RDELTA scores between groups in the "standard" or "verbal" condition, however the control group scored significantly greater than the ld group in the "focus" condition. Interpretation of these results, and also of the scatter among the three scales of the test (A, Ab, B) yields the following conclusions:  (a) There is a verbal component to the CPM. (b) The deficit in mildly language disordered children such as those in the present study is multifactored; there is a "performance" as well as a "competence" component. Language mediated performance can be increased by external stimulation, but there is a limit as to the level of possible improvement in performance. (c) There is an additional component to the deficit present in these children besides the observed language disorder. The ld children were matched to the control on Block Design and Object Assembly (active tasks), but scored significantly lower on the CPM. In addition, they could not make use of a passive nonverbal attention focussing technique, but increased performance when they had to actively deliver verbal justifications for answers. This suggests a deficit in ongoing internal cognitive organization, which is also of a "performance" nature".	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	https://doi.org/10.1089/109493101753376623	The aim of this study was to investigate whether the practice of rotating Virtual Reality (VR) three-dimensional (3D) objects will enhance the spatial rotation  thinking of deaf and hard-of-hearing children compared to the practice of rotating  two-dimensional (2D) objects. Two groups were involved in this study: an  experimental group, which included 21 deaf and hardof-hearing children, who played a  VR 3D game, and a control group of 23 deaf and hard-of-hearing children, who played  a similar 2D (not VR) game. The results clearly indicate that practicing with VR 3D  spatial rotations significantly improved the children's performance of spatial  rotation, which enhanced their ability to perform better in other intellectual  skills as well as in their sign language skills.

Studies have pointed out, that with regard to reasoning, particularly when the process of induction is required, hearing-impaired children usually have difficulties. They experience similar difficulties with their ability to think in a flexible way. Generally, a large body of literature suggests that hearing-impaired children tend to be more concrete and rigid in their thought processes. This study aimed at using Virtual Reality as a tool for improving structural inductive processes and the flexible thinking with hearing-impaired children. Three groups were involved in this study: an experimental group, which included 21 deaf and hard-of-hearing children, who played a VR 3D game; a control group, which included 23 deaf and hard-of-hearing children, who played a similar 2D (not VR game); and a second control group of 16 hearing children for whom no intervention was introduced. The results clearly indicate that practising with VR 3D spatial rotations significantly improved inductive thinking and flexible thinking of the hearing-impaired.

Evidence from Williams syndrome and Down's syndrome.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01460.x	BACKGROUND: Several theorists maintain that exact number abilities rely on language-relevant processes whereas approximate number calls on visuo-spatial  skills. We chose two genetic disorders, Williams syndrome and Down's syndrome, which  differ in their relative abilities in verbal versus spatial skills, to examine this  hypothesis. Five experiments assessed number skills in these two genetic syndromes  and in their mental age (MA) and chronological age (CA) matched controls. METHODS:  Experiment 1 used a preferential looking paradigm with infants and toddlers to  measure sensitivity to changes in numerosity. Experiment 2 measured reaction times  in older children and adults in a numerosity comparison task with dots in a random  pattern. Experiment 3 comprised a number battery that measured various forms of  counting and simple arithmetic. RESULTS: The WS infants displayed a level of  performance equal to that of their CA-controls, whereas the DS infants failed to  reach even the level of their MA-controls. By contrast, the older DS children and  adults outstripped the older WS group in their numerosity abilities, with different  patterns of errors in the two clinical groups. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the  infant and adult number phenotypes between these two genetic disorders are discussed  with reference to the processing styles used by each group and how these might  impact on their developmental trajectories. Theoretically, we highlight our  contention that one cannot infer the infant starting state from the adult end state.  Rather, the development process itself must be taken into account.

database	Paul, Brianna Michelle	2007	thesis	How we come to process ‘what’ and ‘where’ in our visual environment: Insights from typical and atypical developmental populations		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/how-we-come-process-what-where-our-visual/docview/304755118/se-2?accountid=11531	Human visuoperceptual functions can be divided according to their neuroanatomical substrates: processing 'what' an object is depends largely on ventral occipitotemporal regions, whereas processing 'where' an object is relies more on dorsal occipitoparietal regions. Although much is known regarding the mature incarnation of this ventral/dorsal dissociation, little is known about how it develops. The current study addressed this with two experiments that involved both typically-developing children and healthy adults, as well as adult individuals with Williams Syndrome (WS), a genetically-based neurodevelopmental disorder for which dissociations in ventral-dorsal stream processing have been reported. The first experiment examined behavioral performance on two matched tasks differing only in their instructions: attend to stimulus identity (face identity-matching; ventral stream) or to stimulus position (face location-matching; dorsal stream). The second experiment examined patterns of brain activation on these same tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) with each of the three populations. By virtue of including both typical adults and children (chronological age, CA, and mental age, MA, controls for the WS participants) in addition to WS participants, these experiments were well poised to provide both insight into the normal development of ventral and dorsal stream processing, and critical information regarding the integrity of these systems in WS.    Thirty-three individuals with WS (age M = 27.2 years), 19 MA controls (age M = 9.0 years), and 24 CA controls (age  M = 20.7 years) participated in the behavioral experiment. Although overall, typical children (MA controls) responded less accurately and more slowly than adults (CA controls), like adults, their performance did not differ across the identity- and location-matching tasks. By contrast, WS participants showed a pronounced and selective deficit in location-matching when compared with MA controls, but comparable performance on identity-matching. This finding in WS provides empirical support for numerous reports of face processing skills that far exceed general spatial ability in WS. This dissociation is not observed during the course of normal development. Based on this finding, it was hypothesized that the subsequent brain imaging experiment would reveal differentially impacted function in the ventral and dorsal visual streams in WS when compared with typically-developing participants.    In the second experiment, both cognitive and FMRI data were collected from a second set of participants: 15 with WS (age M = 30.1 years), 16 MA controls (age M = 8.9 years), and 17 CA controls (age M = 31.0 years; individually age- and gender-matched to the WS participants). In accordance with their cognitive profile (performance on both tasks that had not quite reached the level of CA controls) MA controls recruited many of the same regions as CA controls, but also differed from them in certain key task-related regions. These regions included the face-preferring temporal fusiform gyrus of the left hemisphere (LH) during identity-matching and superior parietal cortex in the LH during location-matching. Given that most critical task-related regions reside in the right hemisphere (RH) (RH fusiform gyrus for face discrimination, RH parietal cortex for location processing), these findings appear to reflect protracted maturation of task-sensitive regions in the nondominant hemisphere. When compared with profiles of activation in MA and CA controls, brain response in WS participants was abnormal. In accordance with their profound location-matching deficits, WS participants showed a striking lack of location-matching activation in parietal cortex, a finding that is consistent with a dorsal stream deficit hypothesized in this disorder. However, at variance with hypotheses of spared face discrimination and ventral stream function in WS, the brain response was also abnormal for face identity-matching, even though cognitively, WS participants performed this task at the level of MA controls. Abnormalities in WS manifested as a poorly modulated response of the fusiform gyrus, a lack of response in the amygdala, and surprisingly, an abnormally heightened response in a portion of parietal cortex that was not engaged by the task in MA or CA controls. The latter two findings are of particular interest because they may relate to an unusually strong preference for face-to-face social interaction (often described as "hypersociability") that has been described in the WS population.

This study sought to replicate in an adult sample the findings of decreased visuospatial and attention abilities reported for many children with NF-1. Specifically, it was anticipated that adults with NF-1 would be classified separately from unaffected controls according to visual and attention-executive function skills. Second, this study examined whether language skills discriminated between adults with NF-1 and unaffected controls. The sample included 20 participants with NF-1 and 25 control participants. All participants were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests (Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI), Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO), Visual Form Discrimination, Booklet Category Test, Figure Cancellation, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R), Sentence Repetition, Controlled Oral Word Association). The results of a discriminant function analysis partially supported the hypothesis: Two of the tests of visual-spatial skill (VMI, JLO) and one of the language tests (PPVT-R) were found to be the best predictors for group membership. The discriminant function accounted for 45% of the variance between the groups and correctly classified 15 of the NF-1 participants and 21 of the control participants. Post hoc exploratory analyses revealed that the VMI was the most important test in discriminating between the groups. It is suggested that patients with NF-1 will tend to have sparing of basic cognitive functions but will have greater impairment on tests that use multiple cognitive skills.

However it is still unclear to what extent the spatial mechanisms underlying this ability contribute to these difficulties. In the current experiment we examine spatial transformations in adults with ASD and typical adults. Participants performed egocentric transformations and mental rotation of bodies and cars. Results indicated that participants with ASD had general perceptual differences impacting on response times across tasks. However, they also showed more specific differences in the egocentric task suggesting particular difficulty with using the self as a reference frame. These findings suggest that impaired perspective taking could be grounded in difficulty with the spatial transformation used to imagine the self in someone else's place. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

People with autism have great difficulty with understanding the beliefs and desires of other people. In recent years literature has begun to examine the link between impairments in social cognition and abilities which demand the use of spatial and social skills, such as visual perspective taking (VPT). Flavell (1977) defined two levels of perspective taking: VPT level 1 is the ability to understand that other people have a different line of sight to ourselves, whereas VPT level 2 is the understanding that two people viewing the same item from different points in space may see different things. So far, literature on whether either level of VPT is impaired or intact in autism is inconsistent. Here we review studies which have examined VPT levels 1 and 2 in people with autism with a focus on their methods. We conclude the review with an evaluation of the findings into VPT in autism and give recommendations for future research which may give a clearer insight into whether perspective taking is truly impaired in autism. © 2013 Pearson, Ropar and Hamilton.

People with autism have particular difficulty with taking someone else’s point of view. This thesis aimed to examine whether people with autism are impaired at visual perspective taking and the processes which underlie this ability and how this could impact on social interaction. Chapter two examined body representation in children with autism and results showed no significant difference between these and the control groups in regards to performance. Chapter three investigated mental rotation and egocentric spatial transformations in adults with autism compared to typically developing (TD) adults. Results showed that participants with autism were slower but equally accurate in the mental rotation task and slower and less accurate in the egocentric task. Comparisons across tasks suggested that the participants with autism may have general differences in perception compared to typical people. The experiments in Chapter 4 examined level 2 visual perspective taking (VPT2) and the processes which underlie this ability in TD children. The results showed that in typical children VPT2 is driven by the ability to represent bodies from different points of view. Chapter five examined whether children with autism were impaired at VPT2 and whether the same processes predicted this ability in children with and without autism. Results showed that VPT2 in children with autism is predicted by mental rotation ability and not body representation. In the final experiment, level 1 VPT was examined in children with autism. Whilst previous studies have suggested that this ability may be intact in autism, the results of this chapter suggested otherwise. Overall it was found that people with autism have problems in perspective taking which could impact on their social skills.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.1501	Previous research has suggested that people with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) may have difficulty with visual perspective taking (VPT) but it is not clear how  this relates to different strategies that can be used in perspective taking tasks.  The current study examined VPT in 30 children with autism and 30 verbal mental age  matched typical children, in comparison to mental rotation (MR) abilities and body  representation abilities. Using a similar paradigm to Hamilton, Brindley, and Frith  [2009] all children completed three tasks: a VPT task in which children decided what  a toy on a table would look like from a different points of view; a MR task in which  the child decided what a toy would look like after it had been rotated; and a body  posture matching task, in which children matched pictures of a body shown from  different viewpoints. Results showed that children with ASC performed better than  the typically developing children on the MR task, and at a similar level on the VPT  task and body matching task. Importantly, in the typical children VPT performance  was predicted by performance on the body matching task, whereas in the ASC children  VPT performance was predicted by MR ability. These findings suggest that differences  in VPT in ASC may be explained by the use of a spatial rotation strategy rather than  the embodied egocentric transformation strategy used by typical children.

Participants were 44 toddlers between 22 and 38 months of age. In an eye-tracking task, they observed a shape that rotated and disappeared briefly behind an occluder. In an object-fitting task, they rotated wooden blocks and fit them through apertures. Results of the eye-tracking task showed that with increasing age, the toddlers encoded the visible rotation using a more complex eye-movement pattern, increasingly combining tracking movements with gaze shifts to the pivot point. During occlusion, anticipatory looks to the location where the shape would reappear increased with age, whereas looking back to the location where the shape had just disappeared decreased. This suggests that, with increasing age, the toddlers formed a clearer mental representation about the object and its rotational movement. In the object-fitting task, the toddlers succeeded more with increasing age and also rotated the wooden blocks more often correctly before they tried to insert them. Importantly, these preadjustments correlated with anticipatory eye movements, suggesting that both measures tap the same underlying understanding of object rotation. The findings yield new insights into the relation between tasks using looking times and behavioral measures as dependent variables and thus may help to clarify performance differences that have previously been observed in studies with infants and young children.

We tested the predictions of the transformation model, which is based on the hypothesis that changing the intended direction of movement is a time-consuming process that affects the evolution in time of the movement trajectory, and compared how well it fitted the data relative to the power law. We found that the relation between speed and curvature was typically better described by the transformation model than by the power law. However, the power law provided a better description when ellipses were drawn at a fast speed. The analyses of the parameters of the transformation model indicate that processing speed increased linearly with age. In addition, the results suggest that the effects of the spring-like properties of the arm were noticeable when ellipses were drawn at a fast speed. This study indicates that both biomechanical properties and central processes have an effect on the kinematics of continuous movements and particularly on the relation between speed and curvature. However, their relative importance varies with the type of figure and average movement speed. In conclusion, the results support the hypothesis that a time-consuming process of transformation of the intended direction of movement is operating during the production of continuous movements and that this process increases in speed between 8 to 12 years of age.

The purpose of this study was to examine the neuropsychological deficits that are associated with the leukemic child's difficulty in learning arithmetic.    This research involved studying a group of children who were survivors of leukemia. The group consisted of 25 males and 17 females who were patients at British Columbia Children's Hospital. They took part in a study to investigate the long-term effects of treatment for childhood leukemia. A battery of psychological tests were administered.    The Wechsler Intelligence Study for Children-Revised (WISC-R) Arithmetic Subtest and the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R) were used as dependent measures of arithmetic performance. Two different models of neuropsychological functioning were employed to predict arithmetic performance. Model One, a model based on visual-spatial skills, consisted of the Rey Complex Figure Test, the Target Test, and the Embedded Figures Test. Model Two, a model based on memory skills, consisted of the Digit Sign Subtest from the WISC-R, the Sentence Repetition Test, and the Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning Test.    Regression equations were computed to determine which model was the best predictor of arithmetic skills. It was hypothesized that Model One, the visual-spatial model, would be a better predictor of arithmetic performance compared to Model Two, the memory model. These hypotheses were supported. The visual-spatial model accounted for 56% of the variance while the memory model accounted for 31% of the variance in the arithmetic scores on the WRAT-R. The visual-spatial model also accounted for 40% of the variance in WISC-R Arithmetic scores compared to 27% of the variance accounted by the memory model.    The study was also conducted to investigate the effects of gender and of age at the start of prophylactic treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). There were no significant differences between males and females on WRAT-R Arithmetic test scores and on WISC-R Arithmetic subtest scores. In addition, there were no significant differences between those who began treatment before age five and those who began treatment at age five and older. WRAT-R Arithmetic scores and IQ scores were not significant predictors in classifying those who had cranial radiation and those who did not have cranial radiation.    The results of this study indicate that impairments in visual-spatial abilities account for a large part of the ALL child's difficulty in learning mechanical and mental arithmetic. The study also suggests that distractibility and impairments in memory play a smaller role in the ALL child's problems in arithmetic performance. The results of this study indicate that the low performance in mechanical and mental arithmetic of children who have survived Leukemia may be most associated with right-hemisphere brain dysfunction. This finding is consistent with the research on children with nonverbal learning disabilities.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Spatial localization	Neuropsychologia	https://doi.org/10.1016/0028-3932(78)90037-4	Localization abilities within the hemianopic field have been tested in 6 subjects hemidecorticated in early life for infantile hemiplegia-epilepsia. Two other Ss suffering from a pregeniculate (chiasmatic) lesion of visual pathways served as controls. In hemidecorticated Ss, a significant correlation was found between the position of bright targets within the hemianopic field, and the position of corresponding hand pointings. This was not the case in control Ss. In addition, the ocular responses to brief target exposures in the hemianopic field tested in two hemidecorticated Ss, were also significantly related to target position. These results suggest that location of visual stimuli can still be estimated in parts of the visual field which are no longer controlled by cortical areas and that, according to experimental data, the superior colliculus should be responsible for this residual spatial ability. © 1978.

Subsequently, some of these categories have been related to the Visuospatial Working Memory (VSWM) component in children (Mammarella, & cols., 2013) and adolescents (Giofrè, & cols., 2013). Our results with adult population (undergraduate students) show that a high level of control or active processing in VSWM predicts part of the variance found in those geometric concepts demanding a more complex processing, as it is the case of mental transformation.

This plays an important role in a childs sense of direction and finding the correct path, hence developing spatial skills. Results have shown that video game use improved the childrens abilities, albeit at differing speeds, to read signs and avoid enemies, such signs included both images and sounds. We discovered that the girls were more attentive at spotting signs and consider the use of virtual mazes to strengthen children's spatial skills highly effective, although implications and direction of this research are open to discussion. © 2016 IEEE.

In addition to distinctive academic and cognitive patterns, such as weak visual-spatial skills and poor performance in mathematics, deficits in social development have been observed in individuals with NLD. According to a theory put forth by Byron Rourke, deficits in academic and social functioning are hypothesized to arise from a matrix of primary, secondary, and tertiary neuropsychological assets and deficits. Primary neuropsychological deficits include poor tactile perception, psychomotor skills, visual-spatial organizational skills, and difficulty dealing with novelty. In order to validate this theory, previous research has explored the relationship between deficits in social perception and visual-spatial skills, with results being mixed. The purpose of this study was to attempt to validate Rourke's theory by examining the relationship between social perception, and all of the neuropsychological deficits considered primary; visual-spatial-organizational skills, tactile-perceptual skills, and psychomotor speed. Finally, in order to extend this theory, the relationship between executive functioning and social perception was also explored.    Twenty children and adolescents were administered neuropsychological measures assessing visual-spatial-organizational skills (Block Design subtest from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition), tactile perception (Tactile Finger Recognition Test from the Halsted-Reitan Battery), psychomotor speed (Grooved Pegboard Test), executive functioning (The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test), and social perception (Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy-2, [DANVA-2]). Parents also completed the Social Reciprocity Scale (SRS) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Results showed significant correlations between some subtests of the DANVA-2 and performance on the Tactile Finger Recognition test and Block Design. Errors on the Tactile Finger Recognition Test were also found to be predictive of performance on the DANVA-2. Parental ratings of executive functioning were correlated with and predictive of parental ratings of social functioning. Implications for neuropsychological assessment and intervention and recommendations for future research are discussed.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Especially on the implementation of inclusion school which is developing in Indonesia. This research used a qualitative method and involved slow learner students as the subject. Based on the data analysis it was found the spatial ability of slow learners, there were: spatial perception, students were able to describe the other shape of object when its position changed; spatial visualisation, students were able to describe the materials that construct an object; mental rotation, students cannot describe the object being rotated; spatial relation, students cannot describe the relations of same objects; spatial orientation, students were able to describe object from the others perspective. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

Consciousness and cognition	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.concog.2010.06.022	We investigate the common development of children's ability to "look back in time" (retrospection, episodic remembering) and to "look into the future" (prospection).  Experiment 1 with 59 children 5 to 8.5 years old showed mental rotation, as a  measure of prospection, explaining specific variance of free recall, as a measure of  episodic remembering (retrospection) when controlled for cued recall. Experiment 2  with 31 children from 5 to 6.5 years measured episodic remembering with recall of  visually experienced events (seeing which picture was placed inside a box) when  controlling for recall of indirectly conveyed events (being informed about the  pictures placed inside the box by showing the pictures on a monitor). Quite  unexpectedly rotators were markedly worse on indirect items than non-rotators. We  speculate that with the ability to rotate children switch from knowledge retrieval  to episodic remembering, which maintains success for experienced events but has  detrimental effects for indirect information.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00723.x	Studies of the development of mental rotation have yielded conflicting results, apparently because different mental rotation tasks draw on different cognitive  abilities. Children may compare two stimuli at different orientations without mental  rotation if the stimuli contain orientation-free features. Two groups of children  (78 6-year-olds and 92 8-year-olds) participated in an experiment investigating  development of the ability to mentally rotate and the ability to recognize and use  orientation-free features. Children compared two stimuli, one upright and one  rotated, and responded as quickly as possible indicating whether the stimuli were  the same or different. The stimuli were either two panda bears or two ice-cream  cones with three scoops of ice-cream of different colors. The panda bears were  either identical or mirror images. The cones were either identical, mirror images,  or non-mirror images. Response times increased linearly as a function of the angle  of orientation when stimuli were the same and when the stimuli were mirror images.  But response times were much less dependent on angle of orientation for non-mirror  image stimuli. Children as young as 6 years recognized orientation-free stimulus  features and responded without mentally rotating when the task permitted this  strategy.

The relationships with duration for measures requiring visual-spatial skills were more mixed and a visual reasoning task was found to significantly relate to duration but not a measure of visual memory or a measure of nonverbal achievement. There was little evidence to support a relationship between the duration of institutionalization and fine-motor dexterity. The strongest relationships with duration were observed for language measures followed by executive functioning measures. In addition to evaluating which measures demonstrate the strongest relationship with duration, the shape of the relationship was also observed. In this sample, some but not all of the measures were best represented by a nonlinear relationship with duration. For language measures, including a measure of language knowledge and a measure of receptive vocabulary, a nonlinear relationship was observed with increasingly lower scores observed with increasing duration. A nonlinear relationship was also observed for a measure of verbal working memory. These results may demonstrate a sensitive period in language development for children with a history of institutional care that occurs around approximately two years of age.

His following two factors explained most of the variance in the performance of the students and parents: verbal-educational and practical-spatial-mechanical.

Neuropsychologia	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.07.026	The vestibular system contributes to a wide range of functions, from postural and oculomotor reflexes to spatial representation and cognition. Vestibular signals are  important to maintain an internal, updated representation of the body position and  movement in space. However, it is not clear to what extent they are also necessary  to mentally simulate movement in situations that do not involve displacements of the  body, as in mental imagery. The present study assessed how vestibular loss can  affect object-based mental transformations (OMTs), i.e., imagined rotations or  translations of objects relative to the environment. Participants performed one task  of mental rotation of 3D-objects and two mental scanning tasks dealing with the  ability to build and manipulate mental images that have metric properties. Menière's  disease patients were tested before unilateral vestibular neurotomy and during the  recovery period (1 week and 1 month). They were compared to healthy participants  tested at similar time intervals and to bilateral vestibular-defective patients  tested after the recovery period. Vestibular loss impaired all mental imagery tasks.  Performance varied according to the extent of vestibular loss (bilateral patients  were frequently the most impaired) and according to the time elapsed after  unilateral vestibular neurotomy (deficits were stronger at the early stage after  neurotomy and then gradually compensated). These findings indicate that vestibular  signals are necessary to perform OMTs and provide the first demonstration of the  critical role of vestibular signals in processing metric properties of mental  representations. They suggest that vestibular loss disorganizes brain structures  commonly involved in mental imagery, and more generally in mental representation.

They can present novel task types and answer formats, they can record process data, and they can be highly motivating for test takers. This paper introduces the first game-based intelligence assessment implemented in Minecraft, an exceptionally popular video game with more than 200 m copies sold. A matrix-based pattern completion task (PC), a mental rotation task (MR) and a spatial construction task (SC) were implemented in the three-dimensional, immersive environment of the game. PC was intended as a measure of inductive reasoning, whereas MR and SC were measures of spatial ability. We tested 129 children aged 10–12 years old on the Minecraft-based tests as well as equivalent pen-and-paper tests. All three scales fit the Rasch model and were moderately reliable. Factorial validity was good with regard to the distinction between PC and SC, but no distinct factor was found for MR. Convergent validity was good as abilities measured with Minecraft and conventional tests were highly correlated at the latent level (r = 0.72). Subtest-level correlations were in the moderate range. Furthermore, we found that behavioral log-data collected from the game environment was highly predictive of performance in the Minecraft test and, to a lesser extent, also predicted scores in conventional tests. We identify a number of behavioral features associated with spatial reasoning ability, demonstrating the utility of analyzing granular behavioral data in addition to traditional response formats. Overall, our findings indicate that Minecraft is a suitable platform for game-based intelligence assessment and encourage future work aiming to explore game-based problem solving tasks that would not be feasible on paper or in conventional computer-based tests. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Research in developmental disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103806	Specific learning disorders (i.e., dyscalculia and dyslexia) are common, as is their comorbidity. It has been suggested that the core cognitive deficit in dyscalculia is  an impairment in numerical magnitude processing; similarly, in dyslexia,  phonological processing deficits are considered to be the main cognitive deficit.  Cognitive theories on comorbid dyslexia/dyscalculia have suggested a number of  hypotheses about which cognitive deficits underlie the comorbidity. However, few  studies have thus far directly compared the abovementioned cognitive correlates of  dyscalculia and dyslexia. In this study, we assessed symbolic and non-symbolic  numerical magnitude and three subcomponents of phonological processing (phonological  awareness, lexical access and verbal short-term memory). In addition, we  investigated children's domain-general spatial and verbal skills. The effect of  these cognitive correlates on dyscalculia, dyslexia and their comorbidity was  explored. We did not find differences between children with and without dyscalculia  on numerical magnitude processing. On the other hand, children with dyscalculia had  significantly lower spatial skills compared to children without dyscalculia.  Children with dyslexia performed significantly lower on all subcomponents of  phonological processing. Finally, we found an additive effect for comorbid  dyslexia/dyscalculia: impairments in children with co-occurring dyslexia and  dyscalculia were similar to the sum of the impairments in the isolated dyslexia and  isolated dyscalculia groups. The strongest unique predictor of isolated dyscalculia  and comorbid dyslexia/dyscalculia was spatial skills, the strongest unique predictor  of isolated dyslexia was phonological awareness. As only a limited number of  cognitive variables were assessed in this study and the sample sizes were very  small, we should be cautious when interpreting these results.

Clear sex differences in MRT were observed for a sample of 134,317 men and 120,783 women, with men outperforming women. There were also MRT differences as a function of sexual orientation: heterosexual men performed better than homosexual men and homosexual women performed better than heterosexual women. Although bisexual men performed better than homosexual men but less well than heterosexual men, no significant differences were observed between bisexual and homosexual women. MRT performance in both men and women peaked in the 20-30 year range, and declined significantly and markedly thereafter. Both men and women showed a significant negative correlation between left and right digit finger ratio and MRT scores, such that individuals with smaller digit ratios (relatively longer ring finger than index finger) performed better than individuals with larger digit ratios. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

This allowed determination of hand preference patterns across 7 ethnic groups. Sex differences in left-handedness were found in 4 ethnic groups, favoring males, while no significant sex differences were found in three of the groups. Prevalence of left-handedness in the largest of the ethnic groups (self-labelled as "White") was comparable to contemporary hand preference data for this group [Gilbert, A. N., & Wysocki, C. J. (1992). Hand preference and age in the United states. Neuropsychologia, 30, 601-608] but the prevalence of left-handedness in individuals >70 years of age was considerably higher in the present study. Individuals who indicated "either" hand for writing preference had significantly lower spatial performance (mental rotation task) and significantly higher prevalence of hyperactivity, dyslexia, asthma than individuals who had clear left or right hand preferences, in support of Crow et al. [Crow, T., Crow, L., Done, D., & Leask, S. (1998). Relative hand skill predicts academic ability: global deficits at the point of hemispheric indecision. Neuropsychologia, 36, 1275-1282]. Similarly, an association of writing hand preference and non-heterosexual orientation was clearest for individuals with "either" writing hand responses. We conclude that contradictions in the literature as to whether or not these variables are linked to handedness stem largely from different definitions of hand preference. Due to a lack of statistical power in most studies in the literature, the "either" hand writing preference group that yielded the most salient results in this study is not normally available for analysis. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Cognitive research: principles and implications	https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-020-00239-0	BACKGROUND: Prior research has revealed positive effects of spatial activity participation (e.g., playing with blocks, sports) on current and future spatial  skills. However, research has not examined the degree to which spatial activity  participation remains stable over time, and little is known about how participating  in spatial activities at multiple points in development impacts spatial thinking. In  this study, adolescents completed measures of spatial thinking and questionnaires  assessing their current and previous participation in spatial activities. RESULTS:  Participation in childhood spatial activities predicted adolescent spatial activity  participation, and the relation was stronger for females than for males.  Adolescents' current participation in spatial activities predicted spatial thinking  skills, whereas participation in childhood spatial activities predicted adolescents'  spatial habits of mind, even when accounting for factors such as gender and academic  performance. No cumulative benefit was incurred due to participating in spatial  activities in both childhood and adolescence, and a lack of spatial activities in  childhood was not made up for by later spatial activity participation. CONCLUSIONS:  These findings reveal a consistently positive relationship in spatial activity  participation between childhood and adolescence. Results highlight the importance of  participating in spatial activities during childhood, and underscore the  differential impact that participation in spatial activities during childhood versus  adolescence has on different facets of adolescents' spatial thinking. Implications  for the timing of interventions is discussed.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Given that visuospatial performance loads highly on an unrotated principal component indexing general cognitive ability, we tested the association between DRD2 and WISC-R IQ comparing 51 high-IQ, 51 average-IQ, and 35 low-IQ children in the IQ Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) Project. No statistically significant association between the TAQI A DRD2 alleles and IQ was found. Given that a statistically significant portion of genetic variance for specific cognitive abilities is independent of general cognitive ability, it is possible that the TAQI DRD2 association is specific to visuospatial performance and independent of general cognitive ability.

Although memory has been examined longitudinally in conjunction with other cognitive abilities, this chapter examines memory ability in CAP more systematically using isomorphic tests measured during the transition from middle childhood to adolescence. Given that heritability of memory may vary by the type of memory measure employed, the chapter first analyzes different aspects of memory through both phenotypic and univariate genetic analyses before exploring their longitudinal relationships. It is hypothesized in this chapter that like other cognitive abilities such as verbal ability, spatial ability, and perceptual speed, genes will be largely responsible for the similarity in memory across time while the non-shared environment will be largely responsible for the discrepancy between longitudinally assessed memory scores. The results show that the correlation between memory tests was driven almost completely by shared genetic factors while the discrepancy between memory tasks was influenced largely by the non-shared environment (and error). © 2003 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

This study investigates the efficacy of using toy figures, toy buildings, digital plan-view photograph maps and digital photograph snapshots in increasing the spatial skills of children ages 2.5 to 9 years. A pretest-intervention-posttest design study with matched experimental and control groups (n=20) was conducted. The investigators examined children's performance in six skill areas: diminution in scale; identifying the simple perspective of another; mental linear displacement; mental rotation; using an aligned map and rotating an unaligned map into alignment; and identifying a more complex viewpoint of another. Pretest mean total scores were not significantly different. Posttest scores showed a twenty percent gain for the experimental group, but no net gain for the control group. Activities as described in this study can build a foundation of spatial skills needed for later geoscience map activities.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Two studies are reported that examine the interaction between these two domains in Williams syndrome by assessing individuals' comprehension of spoken language with a spatial component. In a first study, the Test for Reception of Grammar (Bishop, 1983) was given to 32 individuals with Williams syndrome and to controls matched individually for total number of errors on the task. Individuals with Williams syndrome had particular problems when asked to comprehend sentences containing spatial prepositions, making significantly more errors on these items than control groups. A second study examined in more detail comprehension of sentences with spatial and non-spatial components, comparing the performance of 15 individuals with Williams syndrome and control groups matched for vocabulary ability. Individuals with Williams syndrome again showed impaired comprehension of spoken spatial terms. In contrast, they were unimpaired in comprehending utterances without a spatial component, with the exception of descriptions testing comprehension of non-spatial comparatives (lighter than and darker than). These results suggest that the spatial difficulties experienced by individuals with Williams syndrome may constrain language comprehension in certain circumstances. They also shed light on the ways in which spatial cognition may interact with language comprehension more generally.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In an attempt to resolve this ambiguity, the present study compared activational effects, using phases of the menstrual cycle as the criteria for estrogen levels, on two- and three- dimensional spatial tasks. As predicted, menstrual cycle effects were obtained for the latter category only. Results were interpreted as a function of the greater ecological validity of three-dimensional tasks.

AIDS care	https://doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2018.1466982	Accurate assessment of HIV-associated cognitive disorders in perinatally infected children and adolescents is challenging. Assessments of general intellectual  functioning, or global cognition, may not provide information regarding  domain-specific strengths and weaknesses, and may therefore fail to detect, impaired  trajectories of development within particular cognitive domains. We compare the  efficacy of global cognitive scores to that of composite cognitive domain scores in  detecting cognitive disorders in a sample of perinatally HIV-infected children, and  a demographically matched HIV negative control group, drawn from the Cape Town  Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort (CTAAC) study. All children were administered a  comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Using data from that test battery, we  created ten separate composite cognitive domains: general intellectual functioning,  attention, working memory, visual memory, verbal memory, language, visual spatial  ability, motor coordination, processing speed and executive function. Within each  domain, each test bore a high level of association with each of the other tests in  that domain (Cronbach's α ≥ .70 for all domains). We found that composite domain  scores calculated on whole-sample data were significantly higher than those  calculated using control-sample data. Our comparison of a global cognitive score to  composite domain scores suggested that the latter provided more detailed information  (regarding strengths, weaknesses, areas of impairment), and when compared to global  scores, were more sensitive in detecting HIV-associated cognitive disorders, and  were able to distinguish HIV-infected patients from uninfected controls. Hence, we  recommend using this method of composite cognitive domains scores, rather than  global aggregate scores, when assessing cognitive function in paediatric HIV. This  method provides a convenient and relatively accurate assessment that might help with  cross-cultural and cross-region comparisons as researchers try to detect cognitive  impairment patterns in HIV-infected children and adolescents globally.

Pediatrics	https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2016-0893	CONTEXT: Research shows, conclusively, that perinatal HIV infection has negative effects on cognitive functioning of children and adolescents. However, the extent of  these cognitive impairments is unknown. Current literature does not document  specific cognitive domains most affected in HIV-infected children and adolescents.  OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze the degree of cognitive  impairment, and the specific cognitive domains affected, in children and adolescents  with perinatally acquired HIV infection. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched 5  electronic bibliographic databases, namely: PubMed, PsychINFO, Academic Search  Premier, Scopus, and WorldCat, by using a search protocol specifically designed for  this study. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected on the basis of set a priori  eligibility criteria. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were assessed by 2  independent reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from included studies were extracted  into Microsoft Excel by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were  identified for inclusion in the systematic review and of this, 6 studies were  included in the meta-analysis. Results from the meta-analysis indicated that working  memory and executive function were the domains most affected by the HIV virus.  LIMITATIONS: Only 27% of the included studies were suitable to enter into the  meta-analysis. There was significant geographic bias in published studies, with only  32% (7/22) of included studies from sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence  supports an association between HIV infection in children and adolescents and  cognitive impairment in the domains of working memory, executive function and  processing speed, with effect size estimates also providing some support for  deficits in visual memory and visual-spatial ability.

Several studies investigated whether one pathway is more vulnerable than the other during development, and whether these streams develop at different rates. The results are still discordant. The aim of the present study was to understand the functionality of the dorsal and the ventral streams in two populations affected by different genetic disorders, Noonan syndrome (NS) and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), and explore the possible genotype–phenotype relationships. ‘Form coherence’ abilities for the ventral stream and ‘motion coherence’ abilities for the dorsal stream were evaluated in 19 participants with NS and 20 participants with 22q11.2DS. Collected data were compared with 55 age-matched controls. Participants with NS and 22q11.2DS did not differ in the form coherence task, and their performance was significantly lower than that of controls. However, in the motion coherence task, the group with NS and controls did not differ, and both obtained significantly higher scores than the group with 22q11.2DS. Our findings indicate that deficits in the dorsal stream are related to the specific genotype, and that in our syndromic groups the ventral stream is more vulnerable than the dorsal stream. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

They do not understand the concept of perspective. This is referred to as egocentrism. Previous studies have used an assessment procedure in which extraneous factors (e.g. number of response choices) may have contributed to the poor performance for children under seven. Children aged 48 to 78 months served as subjects in a series of four studies. Study 1 examined a number of variations on the standard task and it was found that a useful approach to adopt in study of coordination of perspectives is a two-alternative forced-choice task in which the egocentric option is present on only some trials. Study 2 established the validity of the new procedure by comparing results from the simplified approach with a replication of previous research. Contrary to expectation, egocentric children did not improve as a result of the task simplification, arguing against the view that extraneous factors were preventing these children from demonstrating some awareness of perspectives.    The research also sought to explore the nature of the skills underlying the transition to decentered thought, in which children begin to appreciate the concept of perspectives. Studies 3 and 4 examined performance as a function of specific viewpoints (target location) as well as children's appreciation of specific relationships, front-back and left-right (error contrast), as presented in the response choices. Results indicated that the transition to decentered thought is a gradual process in which front-back relations are decentered prior to left-right ones. With respect to target locations, performance was inversely related to distance of the target location from the child's position. Data analysis revealed that the egocentric children attempted to select responses on the basis of their similarity to their own view (egocentric) of the landscape. The target location effect was thus interpreted as an indicator of egocentrism rather than of the onset of decentration. Results were discussed in relation to mental rotation research, in which subjects mentally rotate their image of the landscape. The results raise the question of whether research in mental rotation with children is not also inadvertently tapping egocentrism.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Eighteen children with BECTS were studied in terms of neuropsychological and  learning abilities: intellectual quotient, oral language (phonological production,  naming skills, verbal fluency and syntactic comprehension), drawing and  visuo-spatial skills, visual and selective attention, verbal and visuo-spatial  memory, reading, numeracy and spelling. The mean IQ of the population was within the  normal range, but individual results were heterogeneous. Verbal functions and memory  were normal. In contrast, drawing and visuo-spatial skills, attention and  visuo-spatial memory were significantly weak compared to the normal range for age.  Reading, numeracy and/or spelling ability were significantly delayed by one academic  year or more in ten of the children. In conclusion, despite its benign outcome in  terms of epilepsy, BECTS can be accompanied by specific cognitive disorders and low  academic achievement.

Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rasd.2011.12.009	The aim of this study was to investigate whether children with high-functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger's syndrome (AS) can be differentiated from each other and from typically developing children on their cognitive profiles. The present study included a total of 45 participants: children with autism (high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome) and a matched control group of typically developing children (n = 15 per group). Two tasks were used to establish their cognitive profiles: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III) and the NEPSY scale. Our results highlighted differentiated profiles between the children with Asperger's syndrome and those with high-functioning autism. The first ones showed strengths on verbally mediated skills as well as weaknesses on visual-motor coordination and graphomotor ability, whereas the children with HFA exhibited a profile with deficits on tasks calling upon verbal comprehension and good performances on tasks requiring visuo-spatial skills. This paper argues for a revision of AS criteria in the forthcoming DSM-V rather than a combination of the two subgroups within the autism spectrum disorders in the diagnostic manual. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Irrespective of training condition, 5-year-olds had high error rates for figures discrepant by more than 90°.

Results obtained from a 20-year longitudinal adoption study of 245 adopted children and their biological and adoptive parents, as well as 245 matched nonadoptive (control) parents and offspring, show that this increasing resemblance is due to genetic factors. Adopted children resemble their adoptive parents slightly in early childhood but not at all in middle childhood or adolescence. In contrast, during childhood and adolescence, adopted children become more like their biological parents, and to the same degree as children and parents in control families. Although these results were strongest for general cognitive ability and verbal ability, similar results were found for other specific cognitive abilities - spatial ability, speed of processing, and recognition memory. These findings indicate that, within this population, genes that stably affect cognitive abilities in adulthood do not all come into play until adolescence and that environmental factors that contribute to cognitive development are not correlated with parents' cognitive ability.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether 2- to 4-year-old children use adults' pointing gestures to succeed and understand two complex invisible displacement problems that have not yet been mastered at this age: the spatial translation (Experiment 1) and the spatial rotation problems (Experiment 2). In both experiments, social and non-social conditions were administered. In the social condition, after the invisible displacement of an object to a new spatial position, an experimenter pointed the hiding location of the object. In the non-social condition, no pointing gestures were provided. The results of both experiments revealed that children use adults' pointing gestures over their own (but erroneous) spatial knowledge. Moreover, the results of Experiment 2 showed that social cues help children to succeed, but not to understand, invisible displacements of objects. In discussion, the limitations of using adults' pointing gestures to help children to develop an understanding of spatial problems as well as the reasons why children rely spontaneously on social communicative cues are explored. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We observed a large amount of variability in both children and parents’ behaviors, and in the puzzles they selected. Further, we found relations between parents’ and children’s behaviors. For example, parents provided more scaffolding behaviors for younger children and parents’ persistence-focused language was related to more child attempts after failure. Altogether, the present work shows how using methods of observing children at a distance, we can gain insight into the environment in which they are developing. The results are discussed in terms of how variability in spatial toys and spatial play during naturalistic interactions can help us contextualize the conclusions we draw from lab-based studies. © Copyright © 2021 Pochinki, Reis, Casasola, Oakes and LoBue.

Methods: Study participants were selected from OHCA survivors admitted consecutively to a cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) serving 250,000 of Warsaw's inhabitants, according to the following inclusion criteria: first ever nontraumatic, normothermic cardiac arrest, age ≤ 75 years; cardiology ward survival until discharge, and no history of pre-existing brain disease. Patients' cognitive and neurological status and disability were evaluated in the first days after onset and three, six and 12 months later. Neuropsychological assessment focused on attention, memory, executive, linguistic and visuo-spatial abilities. Neurological examination included assessment of cranial nerves, muscle strength and tone, deep tendon reflexes, cerebellar function, sensory function, and gait. The general psychophysical state was classified using the Disability Rating Scale. Patients' neurorehabilitation needs were determined using data collected three months post-OHCA. This data was used to estimate future demands for such resources in Poland. Results: During a 28-month study period, of 69 OHCA patients admitted to the CICU, 29 met the study criteria (33 survived until discharge from cardiology unit; four did not meet further criteria). Severe consciousness disorders were most frequent in the early post-OHCA phase (28%); no unresponsive patients were identified 12 months later. Of responsive patients who were capable of at least minimal co-operation, 100% (early after OHCA) to 57% (12 months after OHCA) had cognitive impairment, usually with neurological symptoms. Memory impairment was the most common and severe problem, followed by executive, attentional, language and visuo-spatial dysfunctions. The prevalence of neurological deficits ranged from 88% (early after OHCA) to 43% (12 months after OHCA). Due to acquired deficits, between 71% (early post-OHCA) and 36% (12 months post-OHCA) of patients were significantly disabled and often dependent. Although dysfunctions tended to improve, over 50% of the patients remained impaired 12 months post-OHCA, and over 30% were significantly disabled. We estimated that about 800 OHCA survivors/year in Poland will develop symptoms requiring neurorehabilitation. Conclusions: Cognitive and neurological symptoms are common after cardiac arrest brain injury. Establishing specialised neurorehabilitation centres is essential for treating these patients.

This digital medium promotes spatial play because touchscreen games are visuospatial in nature, allowing children to manipulate shapes in ways that highlight spatial relations. Spatial play is important for spatial skill development, but few studies have examined children's digital spatial play. We explored the role of children's spatial abilities and gender in their play with two publicly available, spatially-focused touchscreen games: Busy Shapes, a shape sorting game, and RelationShapes, a puzzle game. Prior to playing the games, 3- and 4-year-olds (N = 55) completed a spatial skills assessment. We found that (a) girls performed better than boys on BusyShapes, and (b) that children's spatial skills were associated with their performance on both spatially-focused touchscreen games. This study is a first step in understanding the potential benefits of digital spatial play for children's spatial thinking. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Differences in spatial abilities, impulsivity, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; DSM-IV: 314.00, 314.01) between child sexual abusers, rapists and delinquents without sex offences were evaluated. In order to assess ADHD in childhood, a retrospective questionnaire was applied. While sex offenders (n = 44) performed lower in spatial abilities and showed higher impulsivity then non-sex delinquents (n = 81) no differences with regard to ADHD were found. Child sexual abusers did not differ from rapists in terms of spatial abilities. Findings fit best with predictions of the developmental instability theory.

Thirty-six subjects were administered tests of verbal, motor and spatial skills performance during the eighth month of pregnancy, when estrogen and progesterone levels are high, and again at five to seven weeks postpartum, when estrogen and progesterone levels are low, in order to detect any hormone mediated changes in performance.    Results showed no significant differences between initial test performance and retest performance in the area of verbal skills and in four of the five motor skills areas tested including dominant hand, both hands, right + left + both hands and assembly. However, there was a significant test-retest difference in the area of nondominant hand motor skills performance. On a nondominant hand motor task, enhanced performance was observed during late pregnancy, high estrogen and progesterone phase, compared with performance during the postpartum period, low estrogen and progesterone phase. In addition, there was a significant test-retest difference in the area of spatial skills performance. As predicted, subjects demonstrated superior spatial skills performance when female hormonal levels were low during postpartum testing compared to testing during pregnancy, when hormonal levels were high. In conclusion, fluctuations in hormonal levels may contribute to performance variations in the areas of spatial skills and nondominant hand motor skills.

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	https://doi.org/10.1080/09297040802577881	The aim of this study was to explore psychopathological and behavior impairments in Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) by focusing on individual differences rather than  group tendencies. Parent/Guardian ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist were  analyzed in order to examine the influence of gender, chronological age, and  cognitive abilities on psychopathological impairment within WBS. In line with  predictions, and consistent with cognitive heterogeneity in WBS, psychopathological  and behavioral abnormalities were variable, with gender and specific cognitive  abilities making significant and independent contributions to this variance. For  gender, females were significantly more likely than males with WBS to display  difficulties with externalizing problems. For specific cognitive abilities, those  cognitive functions characteristic of the classic WBS cognitive profile (a strength  in verbal skills and a weakness in spatial skills) related to significantly greater  internalizing difficulties. Future studies should explore underlying genetic and  neurological differences in individuals with WBS in order to help explain the  variability in psychopathological and cognitive functions.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.1981.53.2.435	It was hypothesized that, since verbal and spatial ability seem to be lateralized (left for verbal, right for spatial), in any dichaptic task individuals with high spatial ability will do best with their left hands and those with high verbal ability best with their right hands. Conversely, scores with high spatial ability should make more errors with their right hands and highly verbal people more errors with their left hands. Some evidence was found to support these hypotheses for males, but for females the relationships seemed more complex. Possible explanations and implications of the findings are discussed.

This deficiency in spatial skills is more prominent in females and has been linked to a lack of developmental activities influenced by gender norms. These deficiencies are especially concerning as increased spatial skills have been repeatedly linked to success in technology and broader STEM learning environments. In females, increased spatial skills have also been linked to positive affective outcomes. Formalised approaches to spatial skill development in middle school are rare and their effectiveness is often limited due to a failure to incorporate the perspectives of practitioners when developing said programs. This paper analyses teacher perceptions of a program designed to address spatial skill development in middle school children. The analysis is based on data collected from the 13 teacher participants at the end of each the 9 modules within the initial program delivery. An outline of program development and examples of materials used are provided. Thematic analysis is used to examine teacher perceptions of program effectiveness and student affect. The findings highlight the impact of teacher perceptions on fidelity of implementation and the need for tailored professional development. Implications for further program development, teacher professional development opportunities and the role of the practitioner in curriculum development are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

In this paper, considerable support for the father's role is presented. Specifically, the research on mother‐ and father‐infant interaction patterns is reviewed in order to describe developmental changes in the nature of differential treatment of the sexes during the first two years of life. Together, the studies reviewed highlight the importance of the father in early sex‐role socialization, delineate a developmental model of the early differential treatment of the sexes, and provide clues as to the origins of later childhood sex differences in verbal and visual‐spatial abilities.

We aimed to assess (a) differences in maternal cognition and caregiving between women in Malawi who received different nutritional supplements, (b) 14 effect modifiers, and (c) associations of cognition and caregiving with biomarkers of iron, Vitamin A, B-vitamin, and fatty acid status. In a randomized controlled trial (n = 869), pregnant women daily received either multiple micronutrients (MMN), 20 g/day lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS), or a control iron/folic acid (IFA) tablet. After delivery, supplementation continued in the MMN and LNS arms, and the IFA control group received placebo until 6 months post-partum, when cognition (n = 712), caregiving behaviour (n = 669), and biomarkers of nutritional status (n = 283) were assessed. In the full group, only one difference was significant: the IFA arm scored 0.22 SD (95% CI [0.01, 0.39], p =.03) higher than the LNS arm in mental rotation. Among subgroups of women with baseline low hemoglobin, poor iron status, or malaria, those who received LNS scored 0.4 to 0.7 SD higher than the IFA arm in verbal fluency. Breastmilk docosahexaenoic acid and Vitamin B12 concentrations were positively associated with verbal fluency and digit span forward (adjusting for covariates ps <.05). In this population in Malawi, maternal supplementation with MMN or LNS did not positively affect maternal cognition or caregiving. Maternal docosahexaenoic acid and B12 status may be important for post-partum attention and executive function. © 2017 The Authors. Maternal and Child Nutrition Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Pediatrics	https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-0412	OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relative benefit of maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation during pregnancy and until 3 months postpartum compared with  iron/folic acid supplementation on child development at preschool age (42 months).  METHODS: We assessed 487 children of mothers who participated in the Supplementation  with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial, a cluster-randomized trial in  Indonesia, on tests adapted and validated in the local context measuring motor,  language, visual attention/spatial, executive, and socioemotional abilities.  Analysis was according to intention to treat. RESULTS: In children of undernourished  mothers (mid-upper arm circumference <23.5 cm), a significant benefit of MMNs was  observed on motor ability (B = 0.39 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08-0.70]; P =  .015) and visual attention/spatial ability (B = 0.37 [95% CI: 0.11-0.62]; P = .004).  In children of anemic mothers (hemoglobin concentration <110 g/L), a significant  benefit of MMNs on visual attention/spatial ability (B = 0.24 [95% CI: 0.02-0.46]; P  = .030) was also observed. No robust effects of maternal MMN supplementation were  found in any developmental domain over all children. CONCLUSIONS: When pregnant  women are undernourished or anemic, provision of MMN supplements can improve the  motor and cognitive abilities of their children up to 3.5 years later, particularly  for both motor function and visual attention/spatial ability. Maternal MMN but not  iron/folic acid supplementation protected children from the detrimental effects of  maternal undernutrition on child motor and cognitive development.

Among first-episode schizophrenia patients, they are also associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) volume. The DLPFC is a key region that regulates heritable cognitive functions implicated in schizophrenia pathogenesis. To further understand the relationship of RGS4 variants to schizophrenia, we examined their associations with cognitive functions among schizophrenia patients and their relatives. We analyzed 31 multiplex, multigenerational Caucasian families with schizophrenia recruited on the basis of 2 affected first-degree relatives. All participants underwent a computerized neurocognitive battery that evaluates accuracy and speed (response time) of performance on abstraction/mental flexibility; attention; verbal, spatial, and face memory; and spatial ability. "Tag" single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) representing common polymorphisms were genotyped. Measured genotype analyses accounting for family relationships were performed using Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines. SNPs rs10917670 ("SNP1") and rs951439 ("SNP7") were associated with face memory speed (P=.0003) at a significance level that survived Bonferroni correction (P=.039). The same SNPs have earlier been reported to be associated with schizophrenia. There also were uncorrected associations with rs10917670 ("SNP1") and rs951439 ("SNP7") on face memory efficiency (P=.03) and verbal memory efficiency (P=0.02), rs28757217 on abstraction/mental flexibility speed (P=.02) and verbal memory efficiency (P=.03), SNP18 (rs2661319) on spatial memory accuracy (P=0.02) and face memory speed (P=.03). RGS4 polymorphisms are associated with variations in cognitive functions and contribute a small but statistically significant proportion of variance in a family-based sample. © The Author 2009.

Controls consisted of two groups: children with idiopathic  generalized tonic-clonic seizure (Group-II) and normal children with non-specific  cough (Group-III). Cases and controls were subjected to cognitive and behaviour  assessment. There was significant difference in the intelligence quotient (IQ) of  cases in domains of visual perception, immediate recall, analysis synthesis and  reasoning, verbal ability, memory and spatial ability. In the age group of 6-18  years, cases had significantly more behaviour problems than control without seizure,  in domains of anxious depressed, withdrawn depressed, somatic problems, social  problems and rule-breaking behaviour. Neurocysticercosis causes decline in cognitive  function and behaviours in older children, which should be recognized early for  appropriate management and to avoid undue parental anxiety.

These questions have been summarized under two topic headings:  (a) what factors make one type of spatial task more difficult than another, and (b) what factors make one individual more able than another. By employing latent trait methods, both individual examinees and individual items may be measured, and a number of previously intractable measurement problems are resolved, and the spatial abilities hypotheses may be evaluated in a way not previously possible.    A picture matching task, using systematically varied images was designed, administered to preschool and early elementary school children, and calibrated using the latent trait method of test score interpretation. Extensive analysis established the task was a reliable and valid measure of ability. Performance was then interpreted, both through constructing different combinations of items and examinees, and through comparison with performance on a number of other achievement measures.    Many of the current findings supported previous hypotheses. It was shown that spatial ability existed as a discreet trait, although it may be independently assessed through items varied in sequence or in spatial orientation. These data suggested that spatial ability might influence general academic achievement, in that less able examinees would have difficulty with school learning. Several distinct developmental patterns emerged: spatial performance improved with age, with increased lateral dominance and with right-left concept mastery. Spatial performance did not differ by sex, consistent past studies of pre-pubescent examinees. Other hypotheses were not supported: performance did not differ between problems with verbal or non-verbal solutions, and was only indirectly related to the number of elements or number of spatial variations in an item.    It was concluded that specification of the relationship between "person ability" and "item difficulty" requires defining certain properties of both tasks and examinees. Thus, the initial assumption, that a more able person will always solve more difficult problems must be modified to include quantification of these component factors. It seems that spatial performance may involve sudden, significant changes in responding, including attending to different properties of a stimulus, and applying previous knowledge in different ways.

Both intelligence tests were administered to 30 subjects (mean age = 11 years, 6 months) who attended a university-affiliated school for reading-disabled children. Informal reading inventories were administered to the 10 subjects whose IQs on the WISC-R and K-ABC were most discrepant. Research questions involving full battery and subtest scores were analyzed using t-tests, correlations, and rotated factor analyses.    The results indicated that mean scores on all scales and subscales were similar and were within the Average range. Skills assessed by the Simultaneous Scale were more compatible with both WISC-R Scales than those of the Sequential Scale. There was equivocal support for Bannatyne's profile of retarded readers, with depressed scores on distractibility and information subtests, but with Conceptualizing and Spatial Ability scores which were comparable. The WISC-R Verbal and K-ABC Achievement scores were highly correlated, as were WISC-R Performance and K-ABC Stimultaneous scores. Word analysis strategies appeared independent of processing strengths and weaknesses. The WISC-R Verbal Scale, however, provided valuable information on reading comprehension; this information was not provided by the K-ABC. The K-ABC Hand Movements subtest loaded on simultaneous, not sequential processing.    It was concluded that both tests measured similar abilities, but that the WISC-R provided more information relevant to reading and did not penalize these reading-disabled students. The validity of the Sequential Processing Scale was found to be questionable and the ceilings on the Simultaneous subtests were too low. Relationships between reading skills and processing modes hypothesized by other researchers were not fully supported by these data.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A number of neurobiological mechanisms related to exceptional mathematical reasoning ability have been postulated, including enhanced brain connectivity. We aimed to further investigate this possibility by comparing a group of mathematically gifted adolescents with an average math ability control group performing mental rotation of complex three-dimensional block figures. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected and differences in intrahemispheric and interhemispheric connectivity between the groups were assessed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The math-gifted showed heightened intrahemispheric frontoparietal connectivity, as well as enhanced interhemispheric frontal connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal and premotor cortex. These enhanced connectivity patterns are consistent with previous studies linking increased activation of the frontal and parietal regions with high fluid intelligence, and may be a unique neural characteristic of the mathematically gifted brain. © 2010 Psychology Press.

Middle-aged (10–12 month) sst2 knockout (sst2KO) and wild-type (WT) mice underwent an unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) procedure for 6 weeks or no stress for control groups. This was followed by a battery of tests to assess emotional and cognitive functions and neuroendocrine status (CORT level). A re-evaluation was performed 6 months later (i.e. with 18-month-old mice). UCMS reproduced neuroendocrine and behavioral features of stress-related disorders such as elevated circulating CORT levels, physical deteriorations, increased anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors and working memory impairments. sst2KO mice displayed behavioral alterations which were similar to stressed WT and exhibited exacerbated changes following UCMS exposure. The evaluations performed in the older mice showed significant long-term effects of UCMS exposure. Old sst2KO mice previously exposed to UCMS exhibited spatial learning and memory accuracy impairments and high levels of anxiety-like behaviors which drastically added to the effects of normal ageing. Spatial abilities and emotionality scores (mean z-scores) measured both at the UCMS outcome and 6 months later were correlated with the initially measured CORT levels in middle-age. The present findings indicate that the deletion of the sst2 receptor gene produces chronic hypercorticosteronemia and exacerbates sensitivity to stressors which over time, have consequences on ageing brain function processes. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A framework for a curriculum based upon the five communication skills of literacy, oracy, numeracy, graphicacy and physiognomacy is proposed. These are ‘basics’ yet represent the essentials of aesthetic education; their use ‘across the curriculum’ could lead to the establishment of ‘whole school’ curriculum policies. Some consideration is made of the relationship of educational psychology, and of Gardner's ‘multiple intelligences’, to the five forms of communication, with particular emphasis on graphicacy (spatial ability) and on physiognomacy (physical ability) which are skills commonly neglected in curriculum planning. © 1985, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The present study investigated subtype and gender differences in three domains of functioning: (a) response inhibition, regarded as the core of the disorder, (b) processing speed, and (c) visual spatial skills.    The sample was comprised of 132 children age 7–13 years of age. Experimental groups included 40 AD/HD–PI, 39 AD/HD combined inattentive and hyperactive (AD/HD–C) and 40 control children with equal gender representation across groups. The Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC) provided screening information and The Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-IV (DICA–IV) was used for diagnostic categorization.    Study findings did not support the hypothesis that AD/HD–PI children differ from AD/HD–C on the core deficit of response inhibition as measured by the Stop Signal Task. Mixed results were found for measures of processing speed taken from the Stop Signal Task and the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEACh). AD/HD–C children were found to be more impaired than either AD/HD–PI or control children on Benton's Line Orientation (BLO) a measure of visual spatial proficiency. BLO was also the only measure to reflect significant gender differences, with girls showing weaker visual spatial skills. Patterns of neuropsychological functioning suggest that AD/HD–PI and AD/HD–C are similar subtypes of the same disorder and that gender differences are not prominent.

All veterinary students in two successive classes (n= 124) dissected the head; experimental groups also identified structures on a cross section of the head. A test assessing spatial knowledge of the head generated 10 dependent variables from two administrations. The test had content validity and statistically significant interrater and test-retest reliability. A live-dog examination generated one additional dependent variable. Analysis of covariance controlling for performance on course examinations and quizzes revealed no treatment effect. Including spatial skill as a third covariate revealed a statistically significant effect of spatial skill on three dependent variables. Men initially had greater spatial skill than women, but spatial skills were equal after 8 months. A qualitative analysis showed the positive impact of this experience on participants. Suggestions for improvement and future research are discussed. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 39: 10-34, 2002.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01088.x	In this paper we examine the relations between parent spatial language input, children's own production of spatial language, and children's later spatial  abilities. Using a longitudinal study design, we coded the use of spatial language  (i.e. words describing the spatial features and properties of objects; e.g. big,  tall, circle, curvy, edge) from child age 14 to 46 months in a diverse sample of 52  parent-child dyads interacting in their home settings. These same children were  given three non-verbal spatial tasks, items from a Spatial Transformation task  (Levine et al., 1999), the Block Design subtest from the WPPSI-III (Wechsler, 2002),  and items on the Spatial Analogies subtest from Primary Test of Cognitive Skills  (Huttenlocher & Levine, 1990) at 54 months of age. We find that parents vary widely  in the amount of spatial language they use with their children during everyday  interactions. This variability in spatial language input, in turn, predicts the  amount of spatial language children produce, controlling for overall parent language  input. Furthermore, children who produce more spatial language are more likely to  perform better on spatial problem solving tasks at a later age.

A review of the literature suggests that a substantial minority of CTBP perform as well as people with visual experience on spatial tasks. A variety of explanations for differences in individual spatial skill have been proposed. Investigation of individual differences in spatial abilities of CTBP is needed.    In this qualitative case study, data from open-ended interviews of nine CTBP were triangulated through observations in natural environments, informant interviews, and record reviews. Constant comparative analysis of all data sources led to creation of individual case study reports. Feedback from each participant verified the accuracy of the thoughts and experiences included in the reports.    Results of analysis across the nine cases suggest the following theory. Congenitally totally blind people are spatial thinkers. They code spatial information kinesthetically and associate other information with locations on a kinesthetic framework. They use echolocation for spatial updating. In this investigation limited visual experience of congenitally totally blind participants was not associated with increased spatial ability. Stronger spatial skills were attributed to individual endowment and associated with (1) adequate attachment in infancy, (2) family acceptance of loss of the dream child, (3) active exploration of objects and environments, enhanced by consistent and interesting early environment, (4) acceptance and inclusion of the preschool child within a small community, (5) both academic ability and a problem-solving style of thinking, and (6) education which stressed early mastery and use of braille and travel skills, along with integration of the skilled student into classes for sighted students.    Early mapping behavior was noted in some cases. Successful use of maps was associated with adequate attachment in infancy, active exploration of environments, small-scale representational play, and clear uncluttered maps of areas relevant to the user's experience or interests.

The British journal of developmental psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-835X.2011.02029.x	Two hundred and sixty-four children aged 6.5-7.5 years (first graders) took part in a pre-test, interaction, and post-test experiment working on a spatial  transformation task known as the 'village task'. Cognitive progress was assessed by  pre- to post-test gains in both an immediate and delayed post-test in dyads and  individual participants as a control. The results indicate clear links between  particular pair types with both communication processes and with learning and  cognitive developmental outcomes. The present study demonstrates that gender can act  as a source of status asymmetry in peer interaction to influence communication,  learning, and cognitive development in same- and mixed-sex dyads.

How can a single network engage in such a diversity of roles? We propose that cognitive computations relying on the dFPN can be pinned down to a core function underlying offline motor planning: action emulation. Emulation creates a dynamic representation of abstract movement kinematics, sustains the internal manipulation of this representation, and ensures its maintenance over short time periods. Based on these fundamental characteristics, the dFPN has evolved from a pure motor control network into a domain-general system supporting various cognitive and motor functions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

The failure of the 4-yr-olds to copy location and orientation under both conditions even when space was topographically coded indicates that at this age the child does not conceptualize space within two dimensions. Although the errors of the 4-yr-olds tended to be of a self-reference nature with respect to orientation and location on rotation trials the axes of the self-reference system were not coordinated. Six and 10-yr-old children performed significantly better on both conditions, with the exceptions that the 6-yr-olds continued to preserve some orientations within a self-reference system. When topographical codes were removed and S imagined rotation there were no significant age differences in total errors; however, older children organized entire subspaces within a self-reference system. The findings support Piaget and Inhelder's hypothesis that two-dimensional reference systems do not develop until the period of concrete operational thought, and they also indicate that even at age 10, the self-reference system continues to function when topographical codes are absent. Several cognitive mechanisms proposed to account for the development of spatial abilities are critically discussed. © 1973.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In learning geometry, the spatial ability is required to solve geometric problems. One of the learning models that can be applied in the learning process to improve students' spatial ability is Van Hiele learning model. Van Hiele learning model is a learning model based on Van Hiele level thinking theory. This research aimed to examine whether the Van Hiele model can give better support to the student's spatial abilities in platonic solid topic. This research was quasi-experiment research with post-test only control group design, which was conducted for one month. The population of this research was the eighth-grade students of junior high school in the Seririt subdistrict. By using random sampling techniques, 64 students were chosen as samples and distributed into two classes. The control group was taught by using conventional learning model, while the experimental group used Van Hiele learning model. Data were obtained through essay test for spatial ability at the end of the research. The data were analyzed by using the right side one tailed t-test. The result of the data analysis showed that the mean score of the experimental class was which was higher than the mean score of the control class. Therefore, Van Hiele learning model could give a positive impact to improve students' spatial ability rather than conventional learning. © 2020 Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

Aim: To assess the effect of regulatory variants in DBH on schizophrenia and its endophenotypes –cognition and tardive dyskinesia. Methods: We tested association of functional variants 19bp Ins/Del, rs1989787 and rs1611115 in DBH with i) schizophrenia (1236 cases, 1136 controls), ii) tardive dyskinesia (83 positive, 162 negative) and iii) performance functions of cognition (357 cases, 306 controls) estimated by the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery. Results: A modest haplotypic (Ins-C; 19bp Ins/Del – rs1989787 C>T; p=0.04) association was observed with schizophrenia. We observed ~39% reduction in activity of 19bp Del allele on luciferase assay. Analysis of covariance revealed interactions of tardive dyskinesia status and: i) 19bp Ins/Del (genotypic, p=0.04) and ii) rs1989787 and rs1611115 (combined genotypic, p=0.004) on Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale total score. Association of rs1611115 with positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) total score (p=0.05) and allelic/genotypic association with lower positive (p=0.03/0.04), general psychopathology (p=0.01/0.01) PANSS scales in tardive dyskinesia-positive; and allelic/genotypic (p=0.02/0.05) with higher score of depressive factors in tardive dyskinesia-negative subgroups were observed. Analysis of covariance with continuous variable of cognition showed interaction of health status with: i) rs1989787 on accuracy and efficiency (p=0.03) of abstraction and mental ﬂexibility; ii) rs1611115 on accuracy of working memory and emotion (p=0.05); iii) 19bp Ins/Del on processing speed of emotion (p=0.03). Allelic/genotypic association of rs1989787 with spatial ability (p=0.02–0.05) among healthy controls; association of rs1611115 with Global Assessment Scale scores in the past month (p=0.05) among schizophrenia subjects of cognition cohort was also observed. Conclusions: With modest genotype–phenotype correlations available for DBH variants, personalized treatment regimens based on DBH activity for ameliorating tardive dyskinesia and cognitive symptoms may be plausible. © The Author(s) 2020.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01925	A growing body of evidence suggests that the ways in which parents and preschool children interact in terms of home-based mathematics activities (i.e., the home  mathematics environment; HME) is related to children's mathematics development  (e.g., primarily numeracy skills and spatial skills); however, this body of evidence  is mixed with some research supporting the relation and others finding null effects.  Importantly, few studies have explicitly examined the factor structure of the HME  and contrasted multiple hypothesized models. To develop more precise models of how  the HME supports children's mathematics development, the structure of the HME needs  to be examined and linked to mathematics performance. The purpose of this study was  to extend prior work by replicating the factor structure of the HME (as one general  HME factor and three specific factors of direct numeracy, indirect numeracy, and  spatial) and using those factors to predict direct assessments of children's  numeracy, mathematical language, and spatial skills. It was hypothesized that the  general HME factor would be related to each direct assessment, the direct numeracy  factor would be related to both numeracy and mathematical language, and the spatial  factor would be related to spatial skills. Using a sample of 129 preschool children  (M age = 4.71 years, SD = 0.55; 46.5% female), a series of confirmatory factor  analyses were conducted. Results diverged somewhat from prior work as the best  fitting model was a bifactor model with a general HME factor and two specific  factors (one that combined direct and indirect numeracy activities and another of  spatial activities) rather than three specific factors as had previously been found.  Further, structural equation modeling analyses suggested that, in contrast to  expectations, only the direct + indirect numeracy factor was a significant predictor  of direct child assessments when accounting for age, sex, and parental education.  These findings provide evidence that a bifactor model is important in understanding  the structure of the HME, but only one specific factor is related to children's  outcomes. Delineating the structure of the HME, and how specific facets of the HME  relate to children's mathematics skills, provides a strong foundation for  understanding and enhancing the mechanisms that support mathematics development.

In humans, spatial ability is also sexually dimorphic, and information about the effects of prenatal androgens on spatial ability can be obtained from studies of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and the ratio of the second and fourth finger lengths (2D:4D). CAH is characterized by prenatal overproduction of adrenal androgens and several lines of evidence suggest that 2D:4D reflects prenatal androgen exposure. Some studies have found that these proxy measures of prenatal androgens predict spatial ability, others have found no significant relationship, and yet others have obtained results in the opposite direction. In light of these mixed findings, we conducted meta-analyses of published literature and unpublished results to determine if, across studies, either of these indicators of prenatal androgens predicts performance on spatial tasks that show a male advantage. In addition, we applied a trim and fill analysis to the data in search of asymmetry that might be an indication of publication bias. Results indicated that females with CAH perform better on these spatial tasks, and CAH males perform worse, than do controls. Little or no relationship exists between 2D:4D and spatial ability. Implications for possible hormonal contributions and the developmental timing of sex differences in spatial cognition are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The task consists of observing images of hands that vary in orientation and presentation (palm view or back view). Participants have to decide as quickly as possible whether the hand stimuli depict a left or a right hand. Although widely used in research, this task remained unavailable to clinicians because it has not been standardized and calibrated to date. To fill the gap, we have adapted and calibrated this mental rotation task among children aged from 7 to 11 years. Psychometric properties notably provide excellent sensitivity (6 = 1), good test-retest stability (ICC =.68), excellent content validity and internal consistency (KR20 =.91), and a further possibility to predict performance on a manual dexterity test (good criterion validity). © 2020 A.N.A.E.

Different factors of spatial ability were measured by standardized tests (water-level task, rod-and-frame test and mental rotation test). Children's cognitive maps of the neighborhood were investigated by sketch maps. Data on the spatial behavior of the children were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Results showed significant age and gender differences with regard to spatial-test performance and concerning the sketch maps of the neighborhood, but also differences between the neighborhoods. Children living in a neighborhood with large and geometrically organized cube-shaped apartment buildings showed the best results in both fields of spatial cognition, children from the old-town neighborhoods the worst. On the one hand, results support the positive influence of intensive spatial behavior on the spatial representations of children. On the other hand, there are hints showing that features of the neighborhood like route angularity and the shape of the buildings have an impact on spatial abilities, too.

Subjects were 861 German secondary-school children (mean age = 14.67; range 10-20 years). Latent class analysis with the data of a computer-game preference scale revealed three types of players: "non-players", "action-and-simulation game players" and "logic-and-skill-training game players". Large gender differences were found with respect to class assignment. More females than males were found in the "logic-and-skill-training game player" class (82.9%) and in the class of "non-players" (81.9%). Males in contrast were overrepresented (81.7%) in the class of "action-and-simulation game players". As expected, males on average outperformed females in mental-rotation test performance (d = 0.63). Furthermore, ANOVA results indicated mean differences in mental-rotation ability between action-and-simulation players and non-players (partial η2 = .01) as well as age differences (partial η2 = .04). With boys, non-players on average had lower MRT scores than action-and-simulation game players. For females, computer-game preference was unrelated to MRT performance. Results are discussed within a nature-nurture-interactionist framework of gender differences in spatial abilities. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Subjects were 172 2nd, 4th and 6th graders from different neighborhoods in Magdeburg, Germany. They completed paper-and-pencil forms of Piaget's Water-Level-Task, the Rod-and-Frame Test and the Mental-Rotations-Test. In addition children were asked to draw sketch maps of their neighborhood. Performance measures in the three spatial tests were modestly related to each other. There were close to zero correlations between most measures of cognitive mapping and spatial-test performance. An analysis with structural equation models confirmed a model with the two uncorrelated second-level spatial factors spatial ability and spatial representations of the environment. Results also indicate that each second-order spatial-ability factor consists of three subfactors, each representing one of the spatial tests. In contrast to previous studies, the results clearly support the distinction between (1) large-scale spatial tasks where the observer is part of the environment and cannot see the whole space of interest from one point of view, and (2) small-scale spatial tasks, on the other hand, where the spatial relations of objects can be seen at once. The implications of this distinction for our understanding of spatial cognition are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The children had to solve mental-rotation tasks with animal pictures, letters, or cube figures, either in a chronometric condition (computerized) or in a psychometric condition (paper-and-pencil). Results show a slight male advantage in mental-rotation accuracy, which is neither influenced by method nor by stimulus type. However, mental-rotation accuracy differed between the stimulus types, with the highest accuracy in animal pictures and the lowest accuracy in cube figures, and between age groups, with better performance in fourth graders than in second graders in both conditions. Results show that psychometric and chronometric mental-rotation tests with all the stimulus types are more or less similarly usable with children of that age. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Developmental psychobiology	https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.21333	The consistent gender differences favoring males in some spatial abilities like mental rotation have raised the question of whether testosterone or other gonadal  hormones contribute to these differences--especially because such gender differences  seem to appear mainly from the age of puberty on. Studies generally suggest that  spatial ability is facilitated by moderately high testosterone levels (i.e., levels  that are relatively high for females and relatively low for males). However, the  role of sex steroids for mental-rotation performance of (pre-) pubertal children has  not been the focus of research, yet. In our study, the relationships between  different aspects of mental-rotation performance (accuracy, reaction time, rotation  speed) and salivary testosterone and estradiol levels were investigated. Subjects  were 109 children (51 boys and 58 girls) aged between 9 and 14 years (M = 11.41,  SD = 1.74). They performed a chronometric mental-rotations test, in which the  stimuli consisted of three-dimensional drawings of Shepard and Metzler cube figures.  In addition, saliva samples were gathered for the analysis of free testosterone and  estradiol levels. Results showed a significant gender difference in reaction time  and rotational speed in favor of boys, and a significant age, but no gender  difference in testosterone and estradiol levels. We found no significant  relationships between hormonal levels and any measure of mental-rotation  performance.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In the first study n = 111 preschool children had to demonstrate their solution strategy in the Picture Rotation Test (PRT) items by thinking aloud; seven different strategies were identified. In the second study these strategies were confirmed by latent class analysis (LCA) with the PRT data of n = 565 preschool children. In addition, a close relationship was found between the solution strategy and children’s age. Results point to a stage model for the development of mental-rotation ability as measured by the PRT, going from inappropriate strategies like guessing or comparing details, to semiappropriate approaches like choosing the stimulus with the smallest angle discrepancy, to a holistic or analytic strategy. A latent transition analysis (LTA) revealed that the ability to mentally rotate objects can be influenced by training in the preschool age.

It was found that autistics displayed more "left-sided" behaviour than normal and retarded children. This finding provided some support for the hypothesis that autistics were right-hemisphere (RH) processors. Autistics are also linguistically deficient as a group, and there has been much speculation in the literature that this phenomenon is symptomatic of a left-hemisphere (LH) dysfunction. These suggestions lent some credence to the clinical observation of a dichotomy of skills and deficits in autistics--namely, that they display superior visuo-spatial skills and are also language deficient. It was therefore decided to discover to what extent it was possible to predict linguistic ability (as measured by Mean Length of Utterance) in these children, based on observed sidedness rations. A correlation coefficient was computed for this bivariate distribution, and the findings were non-significant. Despite the disappointing nature of the results, it was pointed out that the original hypothesis need not be abandoned since it was possible that the tests implemented to assess sidedness were either insensitive or insufficient to measure this phenomenon.

The objective of this research was to make a proposal for the improvement of the visual and spatial abilities of children between 6 and 9 years old with dyseidetic dyslexia, using gamification. The video game was developed with the SUM methodology in the Game Maker Studio environment. A case study was carried out in an Educational Unit of the city of Ibarra-Ecuador, where an evaluation was applied before and after the use of the videogame, to measure the improvement of the visual and spatial abilities of the subjects. In addition, a non-parametric statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon test where it was obtained that 46.15% and 53.84% of the children evaluated had an improvement in their visual and spatial abilities, respectively. © 2019, Associacao Iberica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informacao.

As a group, males but not females showed a significant preference for the mirror image, a pattern paralleled at the individual level (with most males but less than half the females showing the preference). Experiment 1 examined a possible explanation for this performance difference, namely, that females were more sensitive to the angular differences in the familiarized shape. Three- to 4-month-olds were given a discrimination task involving familiarization with a shape at a given rotation and preference testing with the shape in the familiarized versus a novel rotation. Females and males preferred the novel rotation, with no sex difference observed. This finding did not provide support for the suggestion that the sex difference in mental rotation is explained by differential sensitivity to angular rotation. Experiment 2 revealed that the sex difference in mental rotation is observed in 6- to 7-month-olds and 9- to 10-month-olds, suggesting that a sex difference in mental rotation is present at multiple ages during infancy. © International Society on Infant Studies (ISIS).

It has been suggested that children who acquire signed languages rely on concomitant visual-spatial development to support their linguistic development. We consider the case of a native-signing deaf adolescent female with average intelligence who had been reported to struggle with spatial aspects of American Sign Language (ASL) as a child. Results of a battery of linguistic and nonlinguistic tests suggest that she has relatively good ASL skills with the exception of some specific difficulties on spatial tasks that require attention to ASL and nonlinguistic topographic space or changes in visual perspective (e.g., classifiers and referential shift). This child has some difficulties with visual-spatial abilities, and we suggest that this has affected her acquisition of those aspects of ASL that are heavily dependent on visual-spatial processing. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

We obtained localised 1H magnetic resonance spectra from the left frontal lobe and left cerebellum of 15 boys with DMD (mean age 106 months±32) and 15 similarly aged control boys (mean age 115 months±31); all boys underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests. We found a significant (P&lt;0.01) increase in the ratio of choline-containing compounds to N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NA) in the left cerebellum in boys with DMD compared with control boys. There was no change in the creatine/NA ratio and a significant increase (P=0.03) in the Cho/creatine ratio, suggesting that the change in Cho/NA ratio was due to an increase in choline-containing compounds; this increase has been previously observed in the brain of the murine model of DMD, the mdx mouse. No significant changes were observed in spectra obtained from left frontal lobe in DMD compared to controls. We also observed a significant association between Cho/NA in the left cerebellum, and the performance of DMD boys on the Matrix Analogies Test (MAT). The MAT is a test of visuo-spatial ability and non-verbal reasoning Which requires neither manual dexterity nor a verbal response for an adequate performance. A comparison of DMD boys whose cerebellar Cho/NA fell within 2 standard deviations of the control norm (0.56±0.24) with DMD boys whose cerebellar Cho/NA was outside this range (i.e. &gt;0.80) revealed a significant difference in ability on the MAT (P&lt;0.05). DMD boys whose Cho/NA ratio is more than two standard deviations higher than controls perform significantly better on the MAT than DMD boys whose Cho/NA ratio is within the normal range. This finding suggests that the observed elevation in Cho/NA and Cho/creatine is not associated with intellectual deficit (as sampled by the MAT), and may represent a compensatory mechanism. The possible interpretations of these metabolic changes are discussed.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Mathematics Education Research Journal	https://doi.org/10.1007/s13394-021-00387-6	Math anxiety is a negative affective reaction in situations concerning mathematics and is related to poor math performance and a lower mathematical self-concept. Gender differences appear in math anxiety even though gender differences in math abilities are non-existent or minimal in effect size. In the present study, gender and age differences in math anxiety, mental-rotation performance, and perceived mental-rotation performance are investigated as well as (perceived) mental-rotation performance as possible mediators of the relation between gender and math anxiety. Ninety-seven children (54 females) between 11 and 15 years and 84 undergraduate students (59 females) solved a mental-rotation test, rated their performance in this test, and filled out a questionnaire about math anxiety. Increasing gender differences with age were found for math anxiety, mental-rotation performance, and perceived mental-rotation performance. Mental-rotation performance and perceived mental-rotation performance were significant individual mediators for gender differences in math anxiety. Adequate measures should be discussed to enhance females’ mental-rotation abilities and their perception of these skills to reduce gender differences in math anxiety. © 2021, The Author(s).

The stimulus material and stereotype beliefs could partly be responsible for these differences. This was investigated in an experimental study administering traditional cube figures (C-MRT) and structurally similar pellet figures (P-MRT) to middle- and high-school aged children. 168 participants either solved the C-MRT or the P-MRT and filled out a questionnaire about their perceived ability of stereotypically masculine and feminine activities and about their gender stereotype beliefs. Overall, boys outperformed girls and all children who solved the C-MRT were better than those who solved the P-MRT. Only boys' mental-rotation performance increased with age while girls' perceived ability of stereotypically masculine activities decreased. A regression analysis identified children’s gender, their perceived ability of stereotypically masculine activities and their female gender stereotype beliefs as predictors of mental-rotation performance.

According to the cross-sex shift hypothesis, gay men are hypothesized to perform in the direction of heterosexual women and lesbian women in the direction of heterosexual men on cognitive tests. This study investigated sexual orientation differences in spatial navigation and strategy during a virtual Morris water maze task (VMWM). Forty-four heterosexual men, 43 heterosexual women, 39 gay men, and 34 lesbian/bisexual women (aged 18–54 years) navigated a desktop VMWM and completed measures of intelligence, handedness, and childhood gender nonconformity (CGN). We quantified spatial learning (hidden platform trials), probe trial performance, and cued navigation (visible platform trials). Spatial strategies during hidden and probe trials were classified into visual scanning, landmark use, thigmotaxis/circling, and enfilading. In general, heterosexual men scored better than women and gay men on some spatial learning and probe trial measures and used more visual scan strategies. However, some differences disappeared after controlling for age and estimated IQ (e.g., in visual scanning heterosexual men differed from women but not gay men). Heterosexual women did not differ from lesbian/bisexual women. For both sexes, visual scanning predicted probe trial performance. More feminine CGN scores were associated with lower performance among men and greater performance among women on specific spatial learning or probe trial measures. These results provide mixed evidence for the cross-sex shift hypothesis of sexual orientation-related differences in spatial cognition. © 2017, The Author(s).

This study assesses whether cognitive deficits occur as early as age 3 years and whether they are specific to persistently antisocial individuals. Verbal and spatial abilities were assessed at ages 3 and 11 years in 330 male and female children, while antisocial behavior was assessed at ages 8 and 17 years. Persistently antisocial individuals (N = 47) had spatial deficits in the absence of verbal deficits at age 3 years compared to comparisons (N = 133), and also spatial and verbal deficits at age 11 years. Age 3 spatial deficits were independent of social adversity, early hyperactivity, poor test motivation, poor test comprehension, and social discomfort during testing, and they were found in females as well as males. Findings suggest that early spatial deficits contribute to persistent antisocial behavior whereas verbal deficits are developmentally acquired. An early-starter model is proposed whereby early spatial impairments interfere with early bonding and attachment, reflect disrupted right hemisphere affect regulation and expression, and predispose to later persistent antisocial behavior.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.13037	Mental rotation has emerged as an important predictor of success in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). By the age of 4.5 years, boys outperform  girls in these abilities. Because parents use less spatial language with girls at  this age (Pruden and Levine, 2017), the amount of spatial language that children are  exposed to at home is believed to be one potential contributor to this disparity in  preschool age children. To date, it is unclear if this gender difference continues  when children enter school. To address this question in this study, children not yet  in kindergarten (PreK) and kindergarten and first grade children (K+) were recorded  playing with their mothers using magnetic tile toys followed by children's  completion of a mental rotation task. As expected, mothers used more spatial  language with PreK boys than girls; however, this relationship reversed in K+, with  mothers using significantly more spatial language with girls than boys.  Surprisingly, despite this, boys outperformed girls on the mental rotation task.  These findings suggest that although girls' exposure to spatial language is higher  after entry into school, this language difference is not reflected in increases in  mental rotation abilities. Thus, earlier exposure to spatial language may be vital  for the development of mental rotation abilities.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

We observed 4- and 5-year-old same-age, same-sex dyads (n= 38) during a guided play activity, which involved building a house with large colorful blocks. We analyzed children's communication and building behaviors, as well as the role of their coordinated behavior in the structures that they built. Children's spatial talk was associated with the features of a house included in structures, whereas children's building behavior was associated with the complexity of the structures. However, children's coordinated behavior during the interaction mediated the relations between spatial talk and the structures they built. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of encouraging joint guided block play activities in early childhood classrooms to provide children with opportunities to practice and expand their language, math, and spatial skills. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Davidson College of Engineering	2019	conferencePaper	Spatial abilities in early childhood	Proc. Front. Educ. Conf. FIE	https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2018.8658655	Spatial abilities are the capacity to comprehend shapes of objects, their positions and the spatial relations among objects. This paper, which establishes that spatial abilities belong to engineering abilities, presents a set of learning activities that promote the development of spatial abilities in early childhood, thereby proving that engineering abilities can be acquired in early childhood. Spatial abilities promote success in engineering and other STEM fields. For example, an astronomer must be able to visualize the elements of the universe, and an engineering should be able to visualize the components of machinery (s)he is working with. Certain engineering abilities can be developed in very young students, in early childhood. Spatial abilities belong to this category. Children use spatial abilities intuitively in their day-to-day life. By promoting spatial abilities in very young children, they are set up for achievements in engineering and other STEM fields through their life. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that abilities pertaining to engineering are not confined to higher education, and in fact engineering abilities can be acquired by very young students as well. In the following paper, a set of spatial abilities that qualify as engineering abilities appropriate to early childhood are discussed. Further, a set of tools and a set of corresponding learning activities are identified which promote these abilities. These activities are based on the usage of childhood STEM toys such as LEGO building blocks. The target audience are students in their early childhood, between the ages of 2 and 5 years old. The focus is on their acquisition of these abilities through these learning activities. Through this demonstration, the acquisition of spatial abilities as engineering abilities in early childhood is established. © 2018 IEEE.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Also, different researches have shown a consistent correlation between spatial abilities and early mathematics performance. Even though the association between both kinds of skills, as well as its stability along development, is well documented, an emphasis has been made in need to clarify the nature of the relation between both of them. So far, there are few studies available regarding causal effects between spatial reasoning and mathematical skills, and their findings are inconsistent.This thesis aimed to contribute to the debate about the causal relationship between spatial and mathematical abilities. A “causal-chain model” was tested, which assigned mediating roles to two components of the visual-spatial memory system, as well as the effect of spatial skills’ improvement over the enhancement of mathematical skills. Moreover, the moderator role of the child’s sex and his/her initial level of spatial skills were examined, as previous research’s findings pointed in that direction. Finally, an additional goal of this thesis was to explore how children used spatial language, hand's gestures and some specific body movements to carry out the training activities.Two Chilean urban elementary schools, receiving students from middle and low SES, participated in this research. In total, 185-second graders took part. They received spatial training, implemented in the classroom setting. It consisted of 9 hours of hands-on activities, executed in small groups of children. The training was designed following the guided-play approach and embodied cognition theories.The data analyses were carried out comparing groups performance, through univariate (mixed ANCOVA) and multivariate (Latent Change Score Model) statistical techniques.The results showed a significant effect of training over children spatial skills (mental rotation and perspective-taking) and on visual-spatial short-term memory. However, it was not found a transfer effect over students' mathematical performance.Regarding differential intervention effects, children with a low initial level of spatial skills obtained bigger gains, but against the hypothesis, children’ sex had not a moderator effect.

However, very little is known about the affective factors  that influence individual differences in spatial ability, particularly at a young  age. We examine the role of spatial anxiety in young children's performance on a  mental rotation task. We show that even at a young age, children report experiencing  feelings of nervousness at the prospect of engaging in spatial activities. Moreover,  we show that these feelings are associated with reduced mental rotation ability  among students with high but not low working memory (WM). Interestingly, this  WM × spatial anxiety interaction was only found among girls. We discuss these  patterns of results in terms of the problem-solving strategies that boys versus  girls use in solving mental rotation problems.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

OBJECTIVE: To compare the course of cognitive functioning among children with TBI and healthy controls over the first-year post-injury in Guadalajara, Mexico. METHODS: A sample of 46 children with TBI and 46 healthy controls from Guadalajara, Mexico were recruited. Both groups received a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation at three-time (3, 6, and 12 months) with measures of memory, attention, executive function, processing speed, language, perceptual reasoning, visuo-spatial abilities, and intellectual functioning. Sixteen hierarchical linear models (HLMs) were performed to examine whether linear trajectories of cognitive functioning differed over time between groups. RESULTS: Trajectories of neuropsychological performance were significantly worse over time among children with TBI than healthy controls across every cognitive domain. HLMs suggested that cognitive performance increased over time in both groups, however, TBI group scored significantly lower at each time point compare to the control group, except in Stroop-Interference. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive deficits are common during the first-year after pediatric TBI. Thus, it is imperative to implement early rehabilitation programs to mitigate the consequences of these problems in the social, academic, and family reintegration of these children. © 2019-IOS Press and the authors.

The brain anomalies described in SBM are varied and contribute to the complex phenotypic outcomes in neurocognition and behaviour. Several factors have an impact on the severity and type of cognitive outcome. The strongest association with cognitive dysfunction is the presence of hydrocephalus and its complications. Hydrocephalus occurs in 80 - 95% of cases and typically results in attenuation of cerebral white matter, particularly in the posterior aspects of the brain, which is important in the development of spatial skills.

Many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience cognitive problems, related to intellectual and executive functioning as well as processing speed. Previous studies focused mostly on children. Consequently there is a general lack of information on the cognitive functioning of young adult patients, while these patients have to make important decisions regarding study, work and social life. More knowledge on the cognitive functioning of young adult patients may help to better tailor the health care of this group of patients to prevent them from stagnating in society. Methods. Ten young adult patients with SCD (HbSS; mean age 22 years) attending the AMC sickle cell clinic were included in the study. The control group consisted of 20 healthy volunteers of the same age and ethnic background (mean age 23 years). Neuropsychological tests were conducted to measure intelligence, executive functioning, memory, spatial ability, language, and psychomotor processing speed. Results. It was found that the SCD patients scored significantly lower than the controls in the areas of intellectual and executive functioning. Significant differences in cognitive functioning were also observed between the individual patients. Conclusion. In this study it was established that cognitive impairment in patients with SCD may extend into young adulthood. Our findings emphasize the need for psycho-education, early screening of cognitive functioning in patients with SCD and the implementation of short rehabilitation programs.

Mathematical Thinking and Learning	https://doi.org/10.1080/10986065.2020.1818468	Children’s spontaneous focusing on Arabic number symbols (SFONS) has been identified as a relevant component of their early mathematical development. This study investigated whether SFONS is a separate construct from spontaneous focusing on numerosity (SFON) and examined whether it is uniquely related to numerical abilities and mathematics achievement. Participants were 159 kindergartners (4-5-year-olds) who completed measures of SFONS, SFON, numerical abilities, mathematics achievement, spatial ability, and language ability. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a two-factor model representing a separate SFONS and SFON factor best fitted the data, indicating that SFONS is separate from SFON. Correlation and regression analyses showed that SFONS was associated with numerical abilities and mathematics achievement. These associations–except for verbal counting–remained after controlling for age, parental education, spatial ability, language ability, and SFON. These findings suggest that SFONS is a unique component of early mathematical development that deserves attention in early mathematics education. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2002883117	Social inequality in mathematical skill is apparent at kindergarten entry and persists during elementary school. To level the playing field, we trained teachers  to assess children's numerical and spatial skills every 10 wk. Each assessment  provided teachers with information about a child's growth trajectory on each skill,  information designed to help them evaluate their students' progress, reflect on past  instruction, and strategize for the next phase of instruction. A key constraint is  that teachers have limited time to assess individual students. To maximize the  information provided by an assessment, we adapted the difficulty of each assessment  based on each child's age and accumulated evidence about the child's skills.  Children in classrooms of 24 trained teachers scored 0.29 SD higher on numerical  skills at posttest than children in 25 randomly assigned control classrooms (P =  0.005). We observed no effect on spatial skills. The intervention also positively  influenced children's verbal comprehension skills (0.28 SD higher at posttest, P <  0.001), but did not affect their print-literacy skills. We consider the potential  contribution of this approach, in combination with similar regimes of assessment and  instruction in elementary schools, to the reduction of social inequality in  numerical skill and discuss possible explanations for the absence of an effect on  spatial skills.

It was hypothesized that the generative nature of the visual language developed in the experimental children would allow the children to extend the language learned to new situations and help them to solve problems in which no prior training was given. Test results confirmed this hypothesis: The effects of training in the Agam program transferred to cognitive domains in which no training was given. Specifically, the findings indicated positive effects on general intelligence and school readiness of children about to enter first grade, with especially pronounced effects in the areas of arithmetic and writing readiness. Other findings revealed an increased visual learning ability in new tasks that developed in the experimental children. Training effects did not transfer to mental rotation and to memory for realistic designs. The program was found to be equally effective for lower-class as for middle-class children. The effect of the program was greater for children who participated in the program for 2 years as compared with those who joined in the second year, indicating a cumulative effect of the program. This latter finding can also be used to refute an alternative explanation of the obtained experimental effects offered by a motivational theory. The findings on cognitive transfer, taken together with previously reported on concept learning and visual skills, point to the educational potential of the approach advocated by the Agam program, that is, systematic long-term instruction in the domain of visual cognition in early childhood. © 1990.

PloS one	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199051	The negative effects of high normal glucose on cognitive function were previously reported in euglycemic individuals of middle age and the elderly population. This  study aimed at examining the effect of baseline blood glucose levels on spatial  ability, specifically verticality perception on the computerized rod and frame test  (CRFT) in young healthy adults. 63 healthy male medical students (age range from  18-23 years), of whom 30 were non-fasting outside the month of Ramadan and 33  fasting during Ramadan of the year 2016, were recruited in order to create varying  degrees of glycemia during which verticality perception was carried out. Baseline  blood glucose reading was obtained prior to commencing the CRFT test. Blood glucose  levels at the time of testing decreased as the duration between the last meal and  testing increased. A blood glucose range of 62-117 mg/dl was achieved among  participants for this study. Linear regression analysis showed that blood glucose  level at testing correlated positively with all alignment spatial error parameters,  indicating a probable reduction of spatial perception ability with higher blood  glucose levels. These results are consistent with other cognitive studies in older  healthy humans and emphasize the critical impact of early glucose dys-homeostasis on  cognitive function. They also indicate that elevated blood glucose may affect  cognitive functioning outside of the usual complications of diabetes.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Only methods for non-focused cognitive remediation are available to the pediatric field. The aims of this feasibility trial are the description, implementation, and test of an intensive program specific to the training and re-adaptation of memory function in children, called Intensive Memory-Focused Training Program (IM-FTP); (2) Methods: Eleven children and adolescents with ABI (mean age at injury = 12.2 years, brain tumor survivors excluded) were clinically assessed and rehabilitated over 1-month through IM-FTP, including physio-kinesis/occupational, speech, and neuropsychology treatments. Each patient received a psychometric evaluation and a brain functional MRI at enrollment and at discharge. Ten pediatric controls with ABI (mean age at injury = 13.8 years) were clinically assessed, and rehabilitated through a standard program; (3) Results: After treatment, both groups had marked improvement in both immediate and delayed recall. IM-FTP was associated with better learning of semantically related and unrelated words, and larger improvement in immediate recall in prose memory. Imaging showed functional modification in the left frontal inferior cortex; (4) Conclusions: We described an age-independent reproducible multidisciplinary memory-focused rehabilitation protocol, which can be adapted to single patients while preserving inter-subject comparability, and is applicable up to a few months after injury. IM-FTP will now be employed in a powered clinical trial. © 2020 by the authors.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Small changes have been found in older children. This study focused on children's exposures to MP and CP and cognitive development. The hypothesis was that children who used these phones would display differences in cognitive function compared to those who did not. Methods: We recruited 619 fourth-grade students (8-11 years) from 37 schools around Melbourne and Wollongong, Australia. Participants completed a short questionnaire, a computerised cognitive test battery, and the Stroop colour-word test. Parents completed exposure questionnaires on their child's behalf. Analysis used multiple linear regression. The principal exposure-metrics were the total number of reported MP and CP calls weekly categorised into no use ('None'); use less than or equal to the median amount ('Some'); and use more than the median ('More'). The median number of calls/week was 2.5 for MP and 2.0 for CP. Results: MP and CP use for calls was low; and only 5 of 78 comparisons of phone use with cognitive measures were statistically significant. The reaction time to the response-inhibition task was slower in those who used an MP 'More' compared to the 'Some' use group and non-users. For CP use, the response time to the Stroop interference task was slower in the 'More' group versus the 'Some' group, and accuracy was worse in visual recognition and episodic memory tasks and the identification task. In an additional exploratory analysis, there was some evidence of a gender effect on mean reaction times. The highest users for both phone types were girls. Conclusions: Overall, there was little evidence cognitive function was associated with CP and MP use in this age group. Although there was some evidence that effects of MP and CP use on cognition may differ by gender, this needs further exploration. CP results may be more reliable as parents estimated children's phone use and the CPs were at home; results for CP use were broadly consistent with our earlier study of older children. ©2016 Redmayne et al.

In particular, gender gaps in spatial ability are the largest of all gender differences in cognitive abilities. Research on gender differences in spatial ability is reviewed, including the role that parents and educators can play in encouraging these skills using formal instruction, at home and through play. A variety of psychobiosocial factors contribute to these gender differences. Research has shown that the development of spatial ability lays down the foundation for quantitative reasoning, a collective term for mathematical and science skills. For this reason, some researchers have claimed that they contribute to the underrepresentation of women in STEM-fields. However, like other cognitive skills, instruction and practice can yield dramatic improvements in performance on spatial tasks, reducing the magnitude of gender differences. There is also evidence of transfer effects and persistence across the passage of time. A growing number of educational psychologists have argued that early education of spatial intelligence is necessary as a matter of equity for all students, and that it may offer substantial benefits for the later development of mathematical and scientific skills across all ability levels. Parents and caregivers can also encourage children by using spatial language, providing children with enrichment activities that offer spatial learning experiences. Concerted efforts to address the gender gap in spatial ability has the potential to translate into a reduction of the gender gap in STEM, but further research is required to determine which types of training and at what intervals is most efficacious. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

Perspective-taking deficits impact language use and understanding in discourse and more general social and cognitive function. Despite extensive research on perspective taking abilities in individuals with ASD, many factors have not been fully examined. This study further examined the contribution of angular disparity, anthropomorphism of an observer, and language use on visual perspective-taking. Individuals with (ASD) demonstrate a strength in visual spatial cognition and a weakness in visual social cognition. This study examined the factors that may cause people with ASD to have difficulties in taking another’s visual perspective including the impact of angular disparity between the participant’s and observer’s perspectives and the impact of anthropomorphic features on observers. Participants included 15 children with autism spectrum disorders and 15 neurotypical children. This study included three experimental tasks. The first was a visual perspective taking task (VPT2), which examined the participants’ ability to judge how a depicted observer perceived an object. In the visual perspective taking task, the observer viewed the object from different angles, including some trials with angular disparity between the participant’s and the observer’s viewpoints causing opposing views of the same item. The anthropomorphic features of the observer were manipulated by including a block figure, a cartoonish line drawing of a female, and more a naturalistic line drawing of a person (female). The second task included a mental rotation task that required the participant to make judgments about whether two three-dimensional figures were rotations of one another or mirror-images. The third task included the visual perspective taking language task. Participants were required to direct the examiner on how to complete an image based on varying degrees of angular disparity between the participant and examiner’s viewpoints. The VPT2 and mental rotation tasks were computerized and used eye tracking to gather information about participants’ fixations to images and eye gaze patterns. Data analysis examined eye tracking, reaction time, and accuracy data. Visual perspective taking reaction time results were compared to standardized language scores and a standardized non-verbal intelligence standard scores. For the third task, accuracy and language use type were coded. Participants with ASD were less accurate on the visual perspective taking eye tracking task but performed with a similar degree of accuracy on the mental rotation and language tasks. In addition, participants with ASD fixated on the observer more than the object when compare to neurotypical peers. All of the participants used similar language when directing another person on the language visual perspective taking task that did not require looking at the other person. Based on the results of this study, it appears that individuals with ASD are less accurate and use different strategies when completing VPT2 tasks but they use similar language with a similar degree of accuracy when directing another person on a VPT2 task. This may be due to a variety of factors such as the social qualities of the depicted observers, the need to take into account the depicted observers’ location in space, and difficulties suppressing their own egocentric viewpoints. Overall, participants with ASD demonstrated difficulties understanding the visual perspectives of depicted observers which was no the result of mental rotation abilities. Although, they demonstrated this difficulty, they were able to verbally direct another person on a VPT2 task as accurately as their neurotypical counterparts.

Cognitive development	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2021.101068	We developed a non-verbal task assessing updating and manipulation of working memory contents. 80 3- to 7-year-olds (47 girls; predominantly European White) were tested  with a 4 × 4 grid containing 8 boxes (in the 4 centre cells and 4 outer corners). A  sticker was hidden and children searched for it after a delay phase. In the updating  trials, the grid was rotated during delays, in the manipulation trials, the grid was  both occluded and rotated. Rewards were hidden in either the inner or outer boxes  (between-subjects design). Performance was affected by age, rotation degree and  hiding condition. Performance was better in outer boxes trials, where visual  tracking was easier. Occluded inner trials added a substantial cognitive load (which  increased with degree of rotation), resulting in children performing at chance  level, suggesting that manipulation involving mental rotation is a distinct skill  from tracking invisible object displacement, with a more protracted development.

If so, what factors determine this development? Children aged 5 to 9 viewed displays of objects with simple shapes (ball, box) through a peephole in a screen. They were required to cover the visual projections of the objects by sticking cut-out forms onto a transparency that could be fixed against a vertical glass pane (a da Vinci window) placed between the child and the scene. The forms had to match exactly the projective shape, size and position of the projections at the glass pane, from the given viewpoint. To achieve success, participants had to analyse and mentally record the properties of the projections to choose the correct forms from a set of alternatives, and to place them correctly on the transparency. Three different scenes were presented. For each scene, participants were allowed as many trials as they wished. Results showed differences in performance according to age and scene. Only a few 5-and 6-year-olds succeeded in the tasks; in 9-year-olds, the success rate varied from 50 to 100 per cent. Performance was better for the projections of balls placed at different distances than for the projection of the side of a box placed at an angle to the fronto-parallel plane. The sequences of trials made by participants, and the success rates for different aspects of the projections (shape, size and position) suggested that two cognitive factors explain children's difficulties in the task: (i) difficulty in differentiating the real and the projective properties of the objects in the scenes; (ii) lack of spatial skills needed to accurately analyse and reproduce the geometry of the projections.

The sample consisted of 60, two parent families possessing one male and one female child, both of which were older than twelve years of age, recruited in the Toronto, Canada, area. Two dimensional tests were Flags and Card Rotations; three dimensional tests comprised Three Dimensional Mental Rotations and Cube Comparisons. Contrary to expectations, neither type provided evidence of recessive, X-linkage; in fact, one of the largest set of correlations was between fathers and sons, a group expected to show no association under the assumption of X-linkage. Large, significant correlations were found between spouses, suggesting a higher incidence of assortative mating on spatial ability then is typically assumed. Significant main effects were seen for Sex and Generation (parents compared with offspring) in all individuals tests and batteries, with males and the younger generation outperforming females and parents, respectively.

Very few studies have addressed the issue of xanthophylls and cognitive function in younger adults, and no controlled trials have been conducted to date to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z can change cognitive function in this population. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not supplementation with L + Z could improve cognitive function in young (age 18-30), healthy adults. Design: A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial design was used. Fifty-one young, healthy subjects were recruited as part of a larger study on xanthophylls and cognitive function. Subjects were randomized into active supplement (n = 37) and placebo groups (n = 14). MPOD was measured psychophysically using customized heterochromatic flicker photometry. Cognitive function was measured using the CNS Vital Signs testing platform. MPOD and cognitive function were measured every four months for a full year of supplementation. Results: Supplementation increased MPOD significantly over the course of the year, vs. placebo (p < 0.001). Daily supplementation with L + Z and increases in MPOD resulted in significant improvements in spatial memory (p < 0.04), reasoning ability (p < 0.05) and complex attention (p < 0.04), above and beyond improvements due to practice effects. Conclusions: Supplementation with L + Z improves CNS xanthophyll levels and cognitive function in young, healthy adults. Magnitudes of effects are similar to previous work reporting correlations between MPOD and cognition in other populations. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In addition, 13 fathers and 15 mothers of CAH patients participated. Ss also completed the Progressive Matrices, a vocabulary test, and an early life activities questionnaire (ELAQ). Findings indicate that CAH females, as compared with normal females, showed significantly enhanced performance on hidden pattern, card rotation, and mental rotation tests of spatial ability. On the ELAQ, CAH females, relative to normal females, showed significantly lower frequencies of participation in activities involving verbal expression and a trend toward greater participation in spatial manipulation activities. However, differences between CAH females and normal females in early childhood activities did not account for observed differences in spatial ability, given the absence of a significant correlation between the spatial manipulation activity scale and spatial ability. There was an absence of reliable differences between male CAH patients and controls across spatial tasks. Results are consistent with an effect of pre- and perinatal androgenizing hormones on the development of spatial ability.

JAMA	https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2016.21044	IMPORTANCE: Most cognitive functions decline with age. Prior studies suggest that testosterone treatment may improve these functions. OBJECTIVE: To determine if  testosterone treatment compared with placebo is associated with improved verbal  memory and other cognitive functions in older men with low testosterone and  age-associated memory impairment (AAMI). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The  Testosterone Trials (TTrials) were 7 trials to assess the efficacy of testosterone  treatment in older men with low testosterone levels. The Cognitive Function Trial  evaluated cognitive function in all TTrials participants. In 12 US academic medical  centers, 788 men who were 65 years or older with a serum testosterone level less  than 275 ng/mL and impaired sexual function, physical function, or vitality were  allocated to testosterone treatment (n = 394) or placebo (n = 394). A subgroup of  493 men met criteria for AAMI based on baseline subjective memory complaints and  objective memory performance. Enrollment in the TTrials began June 24, 2010; the  final participant completed treatment and assessment in June 2014. INTERVENTIONS:  Testosterone gel (adjusted to maintain the testosterone level within the normal  range for young men) or placebo gel for 1 year. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The  primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to 6 months and 12 months for  delayed paragraph recall (score range, 0 to 50) among men with AAMI. Secondary  outcomes were mean changes in visual memory (Benton Visual Retention Test; score  range, 0 to -26), executive function (Trail-Making Test B minus A; range, -290 to  290), and spatial ability (Card Rotation Test; score range, -80 to 80) among men  with AAMI. Tests were administered at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. RESULTS:  Among the 493 men with AAMI (mean age, 72.3 years [SD, 5.8]; mean baseline  testosterone, 234 ng/dL [SD, 65.1]), 247 were assigned to receive testosterone and  246 to receive placebo. Of these groups, 247 men in the testosterone group and 245  men in the placebo completed the memory study. There was no significant mean change  from baseline to 6 and 12 months in delayed paragraph recall score among men with  AAMI in the testosterone and placebo groups (adjusted estimated difference, -0.07  [95% CI, -0.92 to 0.79]; P = .88). Mean scores for delayed paragraph recall were  14.0 at baseline, 16.0 at 6 months, and 16.2 at 12 months in the testosterone group  and 14.4 at baseline, 16.0 at 6 months, and 16.5 at 12 months in the placebo group.  Testosterone was also not associated with significant differences in visual memory  (-0.28 [95% CI, -0.76 to 0.19]; P = .24), executive function (-5.51 [95% CI, -12.91  to 1.88]; P = .14), or spatial ability (-0.12 [95% CI, -1.89 to 1.65]; P = .89).  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among older men with low testosterone and age-associated  memory impairment, treatment with testosterone for 1 year compared with placebo was  not associated with improved memory or other cognitive functions.

Twenty-one 5- to 7-year-old children with normal language and 21 with language impairment, matched for age, gender, and school were studied. Each child responded to a set of verbal and nonverbal measures. The verbal measures assessed vocabulary and bound-morpheme learning skills, spontaneous language form, and responses to a standardized language test. The nonverbal measures assessed nonverbal intelligence, spatial-rotation, and motor-sequential skills. In addition, the children's parents participated in an interview to describe the child's current speech, language, and learning skills; and to report family history of speech, language, and academic problems.    The results of a stepwise discriminant analysis indicated that four measures accounted for 79% of the variance of the model (p $<$.0001). This four-measure discriminant model had a sensitivity of 91.3% and a specificity of 100%. The measures that contributed to the discriminant model were: parental report of the child's current speech, language, and learning problems; number of errors per terminable unit; family history of speech, language, or academic problems; and mean length of terminable unit. An additional discriminant analysis indicated that the same level of discriminant accuracy could be maintained with the two measures that accounted for the most variance in the four-measure model: parental report of speech and language problems, and number of errors per terminable unit. Confirmatory discriminant analyses of the two-measure and four-measure models indicated that the results were stable across an independent sample. This study underscores the need for data-based approaches to the identification of Spanish-speaking children with language impairment, and the contributions of standard evaluations procedures to the identification of these children: parent interview and language-form analysis. In addition, the findings of this study indicate that a language-form deficit characterized by morphosyntactic difficulties and a high prevalence of family history of speech and language problems characterize children with language impairment regardless of the languages they speak.

Human movement science	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humov.2015.09.012	It has been hypothesised that deficits in the functioning of the mirror neuron system (MNS) and internal modelling may contribute to the motor impairments  associated with DCD. These processes can be explored behaviourally through motor  imagery paradigms. Motor imagery proficiency of children with and without probable  DCD (pDCD) was examined using a complex hand rotation task to explore whether motor  imagery strategies could be used during more complex tasks. Forty-four boys aged  7-13 years participated, 22 with pDCD (mean = 9.90 years ± 1.57) and 22 controls  (mean = 9.68 years ± 1.53). Participants completed the task twice: with and without  motor imagery instructions. Stimuli were presented in two rotational  axes--palm/back, and eight 45° rotational steps. Both groups showed evidence of  following the biomechanical and postural constraints of actual movements. Responses  of children with pDCD were slower and less accurate than controls, with group  differences increasing alongside task complexity. A greater impact of biomechanical  constraints for accuracy was observed in the DCD group. The response characteristics  of children with pDCD likely reflects a reduced capacity to mentally manipulate a  body schema and reduced visuo-motor processing capabilities. Behaviourally, these  processes are linked to MNS and internal modelling function, suggesting deficits in  these systems may contribute to the movement difficulties characteristic of DCD.

Spearman's law of diminishing returns (SLODR), however, implies that the g loadings of test scores likely decrease in magnitude as g increases, or they are nonlinear. The purpose of this study was to (a) investigate whether the g loadings of composite scores from the Differential Ability Scales (2nd ed.) (DAS-II, C. D. Elliott, 2007a, Differential Ability Scales (2nd ed.). San Antonio, TX: Pearson) were nonlinear and (b) if they were nonlinear, to compare them with linear g loadings to demonstrate how SLODR alters the interpretation of these loadings. Linear and nonlinear confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models were used to model Nonverbal Reasoning, Verbal Ability, Visual Spatial Ability, Working Memory, and Processing Speed composite scores in four age groups (5-6, 7-8, 9-13, and 14-17) from the DAS-II norming sample. The nonlinear CFA models provided better fit to the data than did the linear models. In support of SLODR, estimates obtained from the nonlinear CFAs indicated that g loadings decreased as g level increased. The nonlinear portion for the nonverbal reasoning loading, however, was not statistically significant across the age groups. Knowledge of general ability level informs composite score interpretation because g is less likely to produce differences, or is measured less, in those scores at higher g levels. One implication is that it may be more important to examine the pattern of specific abilities at higher general ability levels. © 2013 American Psychological Association.

Intelligence	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2017.02.005	The purpose of this research was to test the consistency in measurement of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V; Wechsler, 2014) constructs across the 6 through 16 age span and to understand the constructs measured by the WISC-V. First-order, higher-order, and bifactor confirmatory factor models were used. Results were compared with two recent studies using higher-order and bifactor exploratory factor analysis (Canivez, Watkins, & Dombrowski, 2015; Dombrowski, Canivez, Watkins, & Beaujean, 2015) and two using confirmatory factor analysis (Canivez, Watkins, & Dombrowski, 2016; Chen, Zhang, Raiford, Zhu, & Weiss, 2015). We found evidence of age-invariance for the constructs measured by the WISC-V. Further, both g and five distinct broad abilities (Verbal Comprehension, Visual Spatial Ability, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed) were needed to explain the covariances among WISC-V subtests, although Fluid Reasoning was nearly equivalent to g. These findings were consistent whether a higher-order or a bifactor hierarchical model was used, but they were somewhat inconsistent with factor analyses from the prior studies. We found a correlation between Fluid Reasoning and Visual Spatial factors beyond a general factor (g) and that Arithmetic was primarily a direct indicator of g. Composite scores from the WISC-V correlated well with their corresponding underlying factors. For those concerned about the fewer numbers of subtests in the Full Scale IQ, the model implied relation between g and the FSIQ was very strong. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The data were split into different age groups to account for changes due to differential development. Multi-group higher-order analysis of mean and covariance structures (MG-MACS) and multiple indicator-multiple cause (MIMIC) models were used to analyze these data. Boys consistently demonstrated a significant mean advantage on the latent visual-spatial ability (Gv) factor. A significant mean advantage was also found for boys on the latent crystallized ability (Gc) factor at all ages except for 17 and 18. Girls scored higher on the latent, higher-order g factor, at all ages, although this difference was statistically significant at only two age levels. An additional test, however, did not reveal a significant Age × Sex interaction effect, suggesting only main effects of Sex on Gv, Gc, and g. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Integrated and Conjoint Confirmatory Factor Analysis With the WISC-IV.	Assessment	https://doi.org/10.1177/1073191115572695	We used integrated and conjoint confirmatory factor analysis of Shipley-2 and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) data to  investigate constructs measured in the Shipley-2 for children and adolescents. We  also estimated Shipley-2 composite reliability at the subtest level rather than the  item level. The three Shipley-2 subtests for the most part measured what was  described in the manual, although Block Patterns measured visual spatial ability in  addition to fluid ability and Abstraction was best considered a measure of  psychometric g. The g factors derived from the WISC-IV and Shipley-2 were similar  but not identical. Internal reliability estimates for Shipley-2 composites that were  based on correlations between the subtests were substantially lower than those based  on the items. Last, based on WISC-IV derived g factors, 37% to 53% of the variance  in Shipley-2 composites was explained by g. Some of the reliable variance in the  Shipley-2 composites was due to something specific that the subtests had in common  not explained by psychometric g.

The present study used factor mixture modeling to investigate SLODR in the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children—Second Edition (KABC-II). Factor mixture modeling was a useful method to study SLODR because group membership was determined based on probabilities derived from the model. A second-order confirmatory factor model, consistent with three-stratum theory (Carroll, 1993), was modeled as a within-class factor structure. The fit of several models with varying number of classes and factorial invariance restrictions were compared. A sex covariate was also included with the models that provided the best fit for the data.    The results indicated that a two-class model, which allowed for  g mean differences, and class-specific g variances and subtest residual variances, provided the most parsimonious explanation of the data. Consistent with SLODR, the second-order general factor explained less subtest variance and less variance in the first-order factors for those of higher general ability. The standardized subtest residual variances were also larger in the high ability class than in the low ability class. Controlling for g, boys performed higher than girls in visual-spatial ability in each of the low and high ability classes.   The findings from this study have implications for future research on the interpretation of intelligence test scores across the ability distribution.

Methods: Forty-two children (9–12 years old) participated in the present study: 20 were children with ADHD (DSM-IV) and 22 were age-matched controls. A classification criterion was used for each test separately and one, for their combination to detect the presence of arithmetic difficulties at two time points: baseline (time 1); and when children with ADHD were taking 0.3–0.5 mg/kg of methylphenidate (time 2). The study also assessed children’s subtraction performance, combining parts of these tests. Results: Separately, the tests were only sensitive to differences between groups without medication. However, by combining the three neuropsychological tests, we observed a difference and detected a reduction in arithmetic difficulties associated with the methylphenidate treatment. The same effects were found in subtraction exercises, which require a borrowing procedure. Conclusions: The present study detected arithmetic difficulties in Brazilian children with ADHD and the effects of methylphenidate. Given this improvement in sensitivity, combining tests could be a promising alternative when working with limited samples. © 2020 Associacao Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria. All rights reserved.

While there is strong evidence of WM impairments in WS, previous research has focused on short-term memory and has neglected assessment of executive components of WM. There is a particular lack of consensus concerning the profile of verbal WM functioning in WS. Here, WS participants were compared to typically developing participants matched for (1) verbal ability and (2) spatial ability (N= 14 in each of the 3 groups). Individuals with WS were impaired on verbal WM tasks, both those involving short-term maintenance of information and executive manipulation, in comparison to verbal-matched controls. Surprisingly, individuals with WS were not impaired on a spatial task assessing short-term maintenance of information in memory (remembering spatial locations) compared to spatial-matched controls. They were, however, impaired on a spatial executive WM task requiring the manipulation of spatial information in memory. The present study suggests that individuals with WS show WM impairments that extend to both verbal and spatial domains, although spatial deficits are selective to executive aspects of WM function. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The interaction between spatial support and maternal education was explored as well. We also investigated predictions of a teacher rating of math performance at second grade, although these effects were less robust. Data were drawn from BONDS (The Behavior Outlook Norwegian Developmental Study), a longitudinal study of Norwegian children and their families. Participants were a subsample of 932 mothers and their 2-year-olds. Mothers were asked to help their children solve both a puzzle task and a shape-color sorting task. Mothers’ spatial support included spatial language, gestures, and placement of objects. Results showed that higher levels of spatial support during mother-child interaction tasks at 2 years of age was significantly associated with fewer math difficulties in second grade. This was the case for a puzzle task (a task associated with spatial visualization skills), but not for a shape-color sorting task (a task associated with shape and color feature discriminations). Conclusions are drawn with respect to the importance of identifying optimal parental spatial strategies associated with better math outcomes. These findings on parental facilitation of spatial skills during joint early play may be useful for future training interventions directed at parents of children at risk for poor math skills. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

This study addressed validity of the JLO in terms of construct and criterion-related validity with 73 children. The sample included normal controls and clinically diagnosed children with psychiatric disorders and/or learning disabilities. The ability of the JLO to discriminate among these groups of children is explored. The correlations between the JLO and more frequently used measures, specifically the WISC-R Performance subtests, confirm that the JLO assesses some component of visual spatial ability assessed by these other measures. The JLO also was found to correlate significantly with math ability as measured by the BASIS and the WRAT-R and, to a lesser degree, with reading ability as measured by the WRMT-R. The results indicate that although there is evidence of construct and criterion-related validity, the JLO did not discriminate among normal controls, clinic-referred children with psychiatric disorders, and clinic-referred children with learning disabilities. © 1992, Sage Publications.

In this first multivariate behavioral genetic analysis of adoption data, cultural transmission was modeled via parental phenotypes, each parental phenotype being allowed to affect all traits in the offspring, and assortative mating and cross-assortative mating were accommodated. Results of a preliminary analysis indicated that selective placement is absent in this study. When the full model was fitted to the data, it was found that assortative mating is more important than cross-assortative mating but is substantial only for verbal ability. Genetic transmission parameters are modest in size, whereas cultural transmission is both small and nonsignificant. A simplified model in which cultural transmission and genotype-environment correlation are constrained to be zero provided a good fit to the data. Analyses of the structures of genetic and environmental correlation matrices indicated a strong genetic general factor and a similar, but weaker, environmental factor. Inspection of the genetic transmission parameters suggests that genetic continuity between early childhood and adulthood may be substantial for verbal ability, spatial ability, and perceptual speed. © 1986 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

The model includes parameters for direct environmental transmission, as well as for three indirect sources of covariation mediated by the parental phenotypes: environmental, genetic, and a combination of genetic and environmental.    Verbal and spatial abilities were assessed in both parents and their offspring, with the offspring being measured longitudinally at ages 2, 3, and 4 years. Sample sizes for the biological-adoptive families ranged from 153 to 197, and for the nonadoptive families from 149 to 224. The ostensible environmental measures included paternal occupation and education, and home measures based on the Caldwell factor scores of Toys, Developmental Advance, and Maternal Responsivity, the Gottfried scales of Variety of Experience, Provision for Exploration, and Home Distractability, and the Family Environment Scales of Personal Growth and Traditional Organization.    The results indicate that heritability for verbal ability increases from infancy (.13) to early childhood (.25), but is stable across this age range for spatial ability (about.25). In addition, the genetic correlation between verbal and spatial abilities is about.50 to.60, suggesting that individual differences in these two behaviors are due to many of the same genes.    The environment-behavior relationships were of primary interest to this study and the results suggest that the effects of only 3 of 10 indices are truly environmental in origin. The Developmental Advance factor was correlated with offspring's behavior at all ages via direct environmental transmission for both concurrent-year and predictive-year relationships, although some genetic mediation was also evidenced. The Maternal Involvement factor also related to offspring's behavior environmentally, although the effect was not consistent across the various ages. Finally, the Variety of Experience scale at age 3 related to both concurrent and later cognitive abilities via direct environmental transmission.

Astronauts have reported difficulties remembering relationships between environmental landmarks when imagined in arbitrary 3D orientations. The present study investigated the effects of strategy training on humans' 1) ability to infer their orientation from landmarks presented ahead and below, 2) performance when subsequently learning a different array, and 3) retention of configurational knowledge over time. On the first experiment day, 24 subjects were tested in a virtual cubic chamber in which a picture of an animal was drawn on each wall. Through trial-by-trial exposures, they had to memorize the spatial relationships among the six pictures around them and learn to predict the direction to a specific picture when facing any view direction, and in any roll orientation. Half of the subjects ("strategy group") were taught methods for remembering picture groupings, while the remainder received no such training ("control group"). After learning one picture array, the procedure was repeated in a second. Accuracy (% correct) and response time learning curves were measured. Performance for the second array and configurational memory of both arrays were also retested 1, 7, and 30 days later. Results showed that subjects "learned how to learn" this generic 3D spatial memory task regardless of their relative orientation to the environment, that ability and configurational knowledge was retained for at least a month, that figure rotation ability and field independence correlate with performance, and that teaching subjects specific strategies in advance significantly improves performance. Training astronauts to perform a similar generic 3D spatial memory task, and suggesting strategies in advance, may help them orient in three dimensions.

Using the ratio of reading times as an index of reading difficulty under spatial transformation, the results confirmed those of earlier studies which have shown that retarded readers' performance is less affected by spatial transformation than is normal readers'. However, an analysis in terms of the ratio of numbers of words read correctly pointed to just the opposite conclusion. The two sets of findings were reconciled by showing that they follow from the form of the function relating reading time to number correct, and by demonstrating that when word lists are equated for orthographic familiarity the performances of retarded and normal readers are equally affected by spatial transformation, whether the time or number ratio is used as an index. © 1984.

Mental rotation involves a mental change of the encoded picture's  orientation, and one has to determine movement vector orientation in motor  programming. In the children, slower rotations were related to higher absolute  orientation errors, and less correct responses with movements rightward of the  target. No significant correlations were found in adults. This result suggests that  in children, motor control and mental rotation may be related through orientation  specification processes.

Lead exposure in children has been associated with both global and specific cognitive deficits. Although chelation therapy is advised for children with blood lead concentrations of >44 μg/dL, treatment options for children with lower blood lead values are limited. Because lead absorption is related to children's nutritional status, micronutrient supplements may be 1 strategy for combating low-level, chronic lead exposure. This study was designed to test the efficacy of iron and zinc supplementation for lowering blood lead concentrations and improving cognitive performance in schoolchildren who live in a lead-contaminated city. METHODS. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled field trial was conducted in public elementary schools in Torreón, an industrialized city in northern Mexico. A metal foundry, located close to the city center and within 3.5 km of 9 schools, was the main source of lead exposure. A total of 602 children who were aged 6 to 8 years and regularly attending first grade in the study schools were enrolled. Children were given 30 mg of iron, 30 mg of zinc, both, or a placebo daily for 6 months. A total of 527 completed the treatment, and 515 were available for long-term follow-up, after another 6 months without supplementation. Eleven cognitive tests of memory, attention, visual-spatial abilities, and learning were administered at baseline and each follow-up. RESULTS. There were no consistent or lasting differences in cognitive performance among treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. Daily supplementation with iron and/or zinc may be of limited usefulness for improving cognition in lead-exposed schoolchildren. However, these treatments may be effective in settings with higher prevalence of nutritional deficiencies or in younger children. Copyright © 2006 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1982.tb01342.x	2 experiments were conducted concerning the development of spatial orientation during the second year of life. Both experiments were focused on oriented search for a hidden target object in the absence of landmarks, which can be accomplished by relating one's movements to knowledge of a target's location. In experiment 1, 18-month-olds were tested to examine the precision with which they use information for the direction and magnitude of self-movement to keep track of the target location. Although the toddlers' search behavior was imprecise, the results showed that they appropriately modulated their search behavior according to the directions and magnitudes of their previous movements away from the hidden target. Experiment 2 was designed to determine whether toddlers can go beyond the information directly experienced in previous routes of travel to infer the shortest route to a hidden target. The results indicated that the 18-month-old and the highly selected 14-month-old subjects can perform spatial inferences of this type.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.1996.83.3.831	Right-left orientation, mental rotation, and perspective-taking were examined in a group of 406 subjects ranging from 5 to 11 yr. of age with equal numbers of children  in each age group. Immediate recognition was not a difficult task as even young  children succeeded adequately on the three tasks involving different images.  Right-left identification, where right and left terms are used, was harder even for  the oldest subjects when associated with mental rotation. When children had to  identify which image a person would see from another viewpoint, they succeeded when  the person was looking away in the same direction as they were looking. When the  person was facing the children (in the opposite direction of "forward"), three  different behaviors emerged which indicated absence or presence of mental rotation  in perspective-taking. Young subjects chose images as if the figures in the image  were seeing from the subject's viewpoint; this percentage diminished slowly across  increased ages. As subjects' ages increased, more chose the correct image. Even at  11 years of age, however, only half of the subjects chose correctly. Finally, an  equal percentage of subjects among the different age groups understood that the  person was seeing a different orientation of the persons but did not associate this  with the correct right-left position of the persons on the image. This transition  most probably reflects the slow evolution of cognitive processes which determine the  way the child will use references to internal or external frameworks. It illustrates  as well the passage from egocentrism to geocentrism with the ability to consider  viewpoints other than one's own.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Importantly, spatial abilities have been shown to be significant predictors of many life outcomes, even after controlling for g. To date, no studies have analyzed the genetic architecture of diverse spatial abilities using a multivariate approach. We developed "gamified" measures of diverse putative spatial abilities. The battery of 10 tests was administered online to 1,367 twin pairs (age 19-21) from the UK-representative Twins Early Development Study (TEDS). We show that spatial abilities constitute a single factor, both phenotypically and genetically, even after controlling for g. This spatial ability factor is highly heritable (69%). We draw three conclusions: (i) The high heritability of spatial ability makes it a good target for gene-hunting research; (ii) some genes will be specific to spatial ability, independent of g; and (iii) these genes will be associated with all components of spatial ability. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Insult to the frontal and temporal lobes are frequent in closed head brain injury. Cognitive deficits in a variety of domains are common sequelae of brain trauma. In many cases, trauma to the frontal and temporal lobe regions engender prominent deficits in higher-order cognitive processing, memory, and attention.      Higher-order cognitive processing, or Executive Functions are the grouping of cognitive processes necessary for organization of thoughts and activities, attending to the activities, prioritizing tasks, managing time efficiently, and making decisions (Alvarez & Emory, 2006; Jurado & Rosselli, 2007; Miyake et al., 2000).  Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the executive functioning construct, researchers often conceptualize the multiple functions into executive subprocesses (Alvarez & Emory, 2006; Goldberg et al., 2003; Goldberg & Weinberger, 2004; Jurado & Rosselli, 2007; Miyake et al., 2000; Stuss & Alexander, 2000; Zelazo et al., 1997) including, but not limited to shifting, updating, inhibition, cognitive flexibility, problem-solving, response maintenance, goal-formation, planning, task-analysis, and even working memory.  Despite the importance of the frontal lobes in regulating cognitive abilities, many of their functions are still not well understood.       Examination of specific executive subprocesses between healthy individuals and those who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) would provide insight into the function of executive subprocesses, how they manifest in healthy controls, and importantly, how they are disturbed by brain injury. Notwithstanding, identifying the neurocognitive profiles associated with certain executive subprocesses may better help medical professionals to classify and treat subtypes of childhood TBI.      Tasks that assess executive subprocesses have existed for many years, with one of the oldest and most well studied task being the Trail Making Test (TMT; Reitan, 1986; Reitan & Wolfson, 1993; U.S. Army Individual Test Battery, 1944).  The Trail Making Test assesses different aspects of executive functioning including, scanning, visuo-motor, spatial skills, tracking, planning, shifting, divided attention, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility ability.  With over 60-years of use, the psychometric properties of the TMT have been well established, and it has been shown to be sensitive to both acquired and neurodevelopmental forms of brain damage (Moll, Oliveira-Souza, Moll, Bramati, & Andreiuolo, 2002; Reitan, 1955; Reynolds, 2002; Wiegner & Donders, 1999; Sánchez-Cubillo et al., 2009; Zakzanis, Mraz, & Graham, 2005).  While sensitive to the biological integrity of the frontal lobes, tasks such as the TMT also appear sensitive to lesions in other brain regions (Demakis, 2004; Stuss, et al., 2001).     In recent years, a number of alternate versions of the TMT have been developed, with one notable example being the Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT; Reynolds 2002).  The CTMT was designed to provide an expanded assessment of the executive functions assessed by its predecessor, and is purported to assess decision-making, planning, inhibition, sequencing, development of actions, and motor outputs.  Like the TMT, initial validity evidence supports the sensitivity of the CTMT to brain injury (Allen, Haderlie, Kazakov, & Mayfield, 2009; Armstrong, Allen, Donohue, & Mayfield, 2007; Orem, Petrac, & Bedwell, 2008).  In addition, the CTMT provides norms based on a large standardization sample (N = 1769) ranging in age from 8 to 89-years of age, that is stratified by age, gender, ethnicity, and geographic region. In order to be representative of the United States population, CTMT norms are based on the 2000 census data.     Based on these considerations, the current study will investigate executive subprocess performance as assessed by the Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT) in 242 children and adolescents, including 121 with TBI, and 121 matched normal controls. The present study will use cluster analysis of CTMT scores to determine whether (1) discrete executive function subgroups of children with TBI can be identified and (2) whether these TBI subgroups differ in executive function profiles from normal children.  Results are anticipated to advance understanding of TBI heterogeneity in executive function ability, as assessed by the CTMT. It is also hoped that results from this study provide insight into higher-order cognitive processing in children, such that results may assist in short- and long-term treatment of childhood TBI.

Hz) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was proposed to mirror cortical maturation with a typical age-related pattern. Here, we examined whether sex differences occur in SWA topography of children and adolescents (22 age-matched subjects, 11 boys, mean age 13.4. years, range: 8.7-19.4, and 11 girls, mean age 13.4. years, range: 9.1-19.0. years). In females, SWA during the first 60. min of NREM sleep was higher over bilateral cortical areas that are related to language functions, while in males SWA was increased over the right prefrontal cortex, a region also involved in spatial abilities. We conclude that cortical areas governing functions in which one sex outperforms the other exhibit increased sleep SWA and, thus, may indicate maturation of sex-specific brain function and higher cortical plasticity during development. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Background: TBI is a heterogeneous disorder that could be associated with cognitive and behavioral impairments. The clinical complexity of TBI patients requires a specialized and integrated approach that involves several rehabilitation experts (Mazzucchi in La riabilitazione neuropsicologica, Elsevier-Masson, Milan, 2012). SaM method (SaMM) (Risoli in La riabilitazione spaziale, Carocci Faber, Rome, 2013) is a new rehabilitation approach based on “embodied cognition” theory (Gallese and Lakoff in Cogn Neuropsychol 22(3):455–479, 2005) and has the aim to improve spatial abilities through structured body exercises. Materials and methods: The patient was a 35-year-old male who had TBI 9 months before. The patient was evaluated, before and after the treatment, with neuropsychological tests (Rey Test copy and reproduction, Elithorn Test, Trail Making Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test), Lawton Index for IADL, level of cognitive functioning, and a qualitative process-oriented assessment with SaMM exercises. The patient was treated with SaMM for 4 months, three times a week. Results: Several of the executed assessments showed an improvement after SaMM treatment. The patient also reported amelioration in some daily activities such as swimming and using phone and money. Discussion: Further investigations are necessary, but the SaMM appeared to be a useful complementary restitutive approach for TBI patients. © 2015, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

This increase in speed has been demonstrated on a number of tasks, such as simple classification (e.g., Akhtar & Enns, 1989), mental rotation (e.g., Kail, Pellegrino & Carter, 1980), reading (e.g., Lorch, Lorch, Gretter, & Horn, 1987), visual search (e.g., Gitomer, Pellegrino & Bisanz, 1983), and picture and name matching (e.g., Bisanz, Danner, & Resnick, 1979), and is constant across tasks that have little in common (Kail, 1991). It has been proposed that this developmental increase in processing speed may reflect underlying maturational changes (e.g., Kail, 1986; 1988; 1991; Hale, 1990). To test whether greater physical maturity would covary with greater processing speed, relative stature (an index of general physical maturity) was determined for 66 female and 68 male 10-year-olds, and the early and late maturers (the upper and lower quartiles of the maturity distribution) were tested individually on 4 information processing speed tasks. Although there were no differences in performance between the early and late maturing females, the early maturing males outperformed their less mature agemates, and the hypothesis of a maturity-speed association received partial support.

The current study focused on two important, but often overlooked skills that recent evidence suggests are important contributors to early math development: patterning and spatial skills. We assessed preschool children's repeating patterning skills, spatial skills, general cognitive skills and math knowledge at the beginning of the pre-kindergarten year. We re-assessed their math knowledge near the end of the school year, with complete data for 73 children. Children's repeating patterning and spatial skills were related and were each unique predictors of children's math knowledge at the same time point and seven months later. Further, repeating patterning skills predicted later math knowledge even after controlling for prior math knowledge. Thus, although repeating patterning and spatial skills are related, repeating patterning skills are a unique predictor of math knowledge and growth. Both theories of early math development and early math standards should be expanded to incorporate a role for repeating patterning and spatial skills. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Child development		In this study we sought to discern whether disturbances in mothers' metabolism during pregnancy may exert long-range effects on the neurobehavioral development of  the progeny. Participants were 139 women with diabetes in pregnancy and their  singleton offspring. Serial estimates of circulating maternal fuels were obtained  for each pregnancy, along with detailed records of perinatal course and outcome.  Offspring were administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Revised  (WISC-R) and Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement: Short Form (KTEA) at ages 7 to  11 years. The rate of WISC-R full-scale IQ scores below 70 in our cohort did not  differ significantly from national estimates. Nonetheless, after statistically  controlling for other influences, WISC-R verbal, performance, and full-scale IQ  scores, and Bannatyne's indices of Verbal Conceptualization Ability, Acquired  knowledge, Spatial Ability, and Sequencing Ability were inversely correlated with  measures of maternal lipid and glucose metabolism in the second and third  trimesters. KTEA Arithmetic scores were similarly correlated with measures of  maternal lipids in the third trimester. All correlations indicate that poorer  maternal metabolic regulation was attended by poorer child performance. The effects  of maternal metabolism on fetal brain and neurobehavioral development are discussed  as potential intermediary factors.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Infant and Child Development	https://doi.org/10.1002/icd.336	This cross-sectional study explored whether participation, from early childhood, in play involving different cognitive abilities predicts visuo-spatial achievement at ages 9,12, and 15. Based on parental assessment, prior and present practice of spatial manipulation play was found to be consistently more frequent in boys than in girls; the reverse held true for verbal expression play. Whereas boys did not significantly outperform girls in three visuo-spatial tasks, girls were superior on a contrastive vocabulary task. In general, with IQ statistically controlled, regression analyses showed that estimated past and present spatial manipulation play predicted both genders' proficiency in the water-level task and Embedded Figures Test, as did mothers' socioeconomic status for Block Design performance. Contrastingly, a negative relation was established between spatial manipulation play and vocabulary scores. Similar to the activity-ability association often identified among adults, the relation established here between spatial play experience and visuo-spatial ability was only modest. Further research should aim at more definitive conclusions through augmenting both diversity in the visuo-spatial skills measured and sophistication in play behaviour appraisal.

Developmental neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1207/S15326942DN1702_04	The area of cognitive research that has produced the most consistent sex differences is spatial ability. In particular, men usually perform better on mental rotation  tasks than women. Performance on mental rotation tasks has been associated with  right parietal activation levels, both during task performance and prior to  performance during baseline recordings. This study examined the relations among sex,  age, electroencephalogram (EEG) hemispheric activation (at the 10.5 Hz to 13.5 Hz  frequency band), and 2-D mental rotation task ability. Nineteen 8-year-olds (10  boys) and 20 college students (10 men) had EEG recorded at baseline and while  performing a mental rotation task. Men had a faster reaction time on the mental  rotation task than women, whereas there were no differences between boys and girls.  After covarying for baseline EEG power values, men exhibited more activation (lower  EEG power values) than women in the parietal and posterior temporal regions, whereas  boys' and girls' power values did not differ in the parietal or posterior temporal  regions. Furthermore, during the baseline condition, men generally exhibited more  activation (lower EEG power values) throughout all regions of the scalp. Results  support the hypothesis that a change that affects both brain activation and  performance on mental rotation tasks occurs sometime between childhood and  adulthood.

These differences are inconsistent in children. The present study examined relations among age, sex, EEG hemispheric activation, and performance on spatial and verbal tasks. Thirty-two eight-year-olds (16 boys) and 32 college students (16 men) had EEG recorded at baseline and while performing a computerized 2-dimensional Gingerbread Man mental rotation task, a computerized 2-dimensional Alphanumeric mental rotation task, a computerized 3-dimensional Basketball Player mental rotation task, and a computerized Lexical Decision-Making task. Additionally, participants completed a paper-and-pencil Water Level task and an oral Verbal Fluency task. On the 2-dimensional Alphanumeric and 3-dimensional Basketball Player mental rotation tasks men performed better than boys, but the performance of women and girls did not differ. On the Lexical Decision-Making and Water level tasks, men performed better than women, while there was no difference between boys and girls. No sex differences were found on the 2-dimensional Gingerbread Man mental rotation task or Verbal Fluency task. Analyses of task-related data also indicate that computer familiarization or computer related task demands might contribute to sex differences on computerized tasks. EEG analyses indicated that, on the 2-dimensional Alphanumeric mental rotation task, men exhibited more left posterior temporal activation than women, while there were no differences between boys and girls. Additionally, there was evidence that simple, or 2-dimensional, mental rotation tasks are associated with left posterior brain activation, while 3-dimensional mental rotation tasks are associated with right posterior brain activation. On the 2-dimensional Gingerbread Man mental rotation task, males exhibited more activation of the left parietal area than females, while on the 2-dimensional Alphanumeric mental rotation task, men exhibited more activation of the left posterior temporal area than women. On the 3-dimensional Basketball player mental rotation task, all participants exhibited greater activation of the right parietal area than the left parietal area.

Child development		The spatial referents "left" and "right" are one of the most common means for specifying direction and location, yet little is known about the processes that  underlie the use of these concepts. Two studies tested the hypothesis that children  and adults who correctly identify left-right directions from nonoccupied  orientations perform imagined rotations to align the self's frame of reference with  the other's. Children who make incorrect judgments from nonoccupied orientations  were hypothesized to use a stationary egocentric reference frame. 28 6- and  8-year-old children and 9 adults were tested on a task that required making  left-right direction judgments from various rotated orientations. The results  supported the mental rotation hypothesis: Only correct responders showed a linear  increase in response time with increasing angular disparity between the self and  other. Mental rotation permits the continued use of an egocentric reference frame  for specifying left-right relations from nonoccupied positions.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In Logo, the programmer draws pictures on a video monitor by entering commands that move a small image of a triangle (the "turtle") across the screen. There are two types of commands: Drawing commands that move the turtle in a straight line and turn commands that rotate the turtle to its left or to its right. Correct use of the turn commands requires using the turtle, not the self, as a frame of reference for specifying direction of rotation. The present study focused on developmental differences in the spatial skills that underlie the use of these turn commands.    There were three major objectives of the study. The first objective was to assess the fit of a hypothesized model of the development of spatial understanding in Logo. The model predicted four levels of skill that reflected a developmental transition from self-centered to turtle-centered frames of reference. The second objective was to examine the relation between children's prior spatial knowledge and their performance in the Logo context. The final objective was to assess the impact of task complexity on performance and to assess the degree of learning that occurs with a limited amount of practice and feedback.    Thirty-two first and second grade children, with no prior computer programming experience, were tested individually one hour a week for three consecutive weeks. Children were tested on tasks of varying complexity that assessed both prior spatial knowledge and spatial skills in the Logo context. In addition, children received practice and feedback in the use of the Logo commands.    The results revealed reliable developmental differences in children's spatial skills. Patterns of performance supported the hypothesized model and revealed a developmental shift from self-centered to turtle-centered frames of reference. In addition, level of prior spatial knowledge was a strong predictor of skill level in the Logo domain. Finally, performance was highly consistent across different tasks and showed little improvement as a result of practice and feedback. The implications of these findings were discussed in terms of the importance of prior knowledge in the learning of new skills.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A violation-of-expectation method was used to assess infants' reaction to possible and impossible outcomes of an object's orientation after it translated or rotated behind an occluder. Results of a first experiment show that at all ages infants tend to look significantly longer at an impossible orientation outcome following invisible transformations. These results suggest that from 4 months of age, infants have the ability to detect orientation-specific information about an object undergoing linear or curvilinear invisible spatial transformations. A second experiment controlling for perceptual cues that infants might have used in the first experiment to track the object orientation replicates the results with a new sample of 4- and 6-month-old infants. Finally, a control experiment involving no motion yielded negative results, providing further support that infants as young as 4 months old use motion information to mentally track invisible spatial transformations. The results obtained in the rotation condition of both experiments are tentatively interpreted as providing first evidence of some rudiments of mental rotation in infancy. © 1996 Ablex Publishing Corporation.

Two groups of 5- to 8-month-old infants, who were either able or yet unable to sit on their own, were videotaped while they reached for objects in four different posture conditions that provided varying amounts of body support. Videotapes of infant reaches were microanalyzed to determine the relative engagement of both hands during reaches. Results demonstrate the interaction between postural development and the morphology of infant reaching. Nonsitting infants displayed symmetrical and synergistic engagement of both arms and hands while reaching in all but the seated posture condition. Sitting infants, by contrast, showed asymmetrical and lateralized (one-handed) reaches in all posture conditions. Results also show that, aside from posture, the perceived spatial arrangement of the object display is a determinant of infant reaching. Combined, these results are discussed as evidence for the interaction between postural and perceptual development in the control of early eye-hand coordination.

The present study investigated with children in 2nd grade of Primary Education the effect of training on MR, with 450 trials distributed across three sessions, as well as on mathematical competence. The results showed an improvement in this spatial skill in the experimental group in relation to the control (ηp 2 = 0.10). There were no differences between sexes in MR before training, and the increase was significantly higher in boys, when intelligence was controlled. Without controlling intelligence, both sexes improved at the same rate. These results are consistent with two parallel studies that were carried out with preschool and secondary school students. The MR training did not produce any improvement in mathematical ability. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The point when a consistent preference for the novel stimulus commenced was identified for each infant, and their preferences for the familiar and novel stimuli in trials preceding that point were examined. Infants who saw objects or faces as stimuli both exhibited selective attention to the familiar stimulus prior to preferring novel stimuli, although infants shown kaleidoscope patterns did not. These results document a preference for familiarity early in processing with a procedure that is not subject to ambiguities due to individual differences in processing speed or to collapsing data across infants. The results support a nonlinear model for memory formation during infancy and underscore recently voiced concerns that in research on cognitive development, infants' attention to perceptual familiarity-novelty must be carefully disentangled from conceptual knowledge.

The British journal of developmental psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjdp.12248	The study investigated cross-cultural differences in variability and average performance in arithmetic, mathematical reasoning, symbolic and non-symbolic  magnitude processing, intelligence, spatial ability, and mathematical anxiety in 890  6- to 9-year-old children from the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. Cross-cultural  differences explained 28% of the variance in arithmetic and 17.3% of the variance in  mathematical reasoning, with Chinese children outperforming the other two groups. No  cross-cultural differences were observed for spatial ability and mathematical  anxiety. In all samples, symbolic magnitude processing and mathematical reasoning  were independently related to early arithmetic. Other factors, such as non-symbolic  magnitude processing, mental rotation, intelligence, and mathematical anxiety,  produced differential patterns across the populations. The results are discussed in  relation to potential influences of parental practice, school readiness, and  linguistic factors on individual differences in early mathematics. Statement of  contribution What is already known on this subject? Cross-cultural differences in  mathematical ability are present in preschool children. Similar mechanisms of  mathematical development operate in preschool children from the United Kingdom,  Russia, and China. Tasks that require understanding of numbers are best predictors  of arithmetic in preschool children. What does this study add? Cross-cultural  differences in mathematical ability become greater with age/years of formal  education. Similar mechanisms of mathematical development operate in early primary  school children from the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. Symbolic number  magnitude and mathematical reasoning are the main predictors of arithmetic in all  three populations.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00333	Previous research has consistently found an association between spatial and mathematical abilities. We hypothesized that this link may partially explain the  consistently observed advantage in mathematics demonstrated by East Asian children.  Spatial complexity of the character-based writing systems may reflect or lead to a  cognitive advantage relevant to mathematics. Seven hundered and twenty one 6-9-year  old children from the UK and Russia were assessed on a battery of cognitive skills  and arithmetic. The Russian children were recruited from specialist linguistic  schools and divided into four different language groups, based on the second  language they were learning (i.e., English, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese). The UK  children attended regular schools and were not learning any second language. The  testing took place twice across the school year, once at the beginning, before the  start of the second language acquisition, and once at the end of the year. The study  had two aims: (1) to test whether spatial ability predicts mathematical ability in  7-9 year-old children across the samples; (2) to test whether acquisition and usage  of a character-based writing system leads to an advantage in performance in  arithmetic and related cognitive tasks. The longitudinal link from spatial ability  to mathematics was found only in the Russian sample. The effect of second language  acquisition on mathematics or other cognitive skills was negligible, although some  effect of Chinese language on mathematical reasoning was suggested. Overall, the  findings suggest that although spatial ability is related to mathematics at this  age, one academic year of exposure to spatially complex writing systems is not  enough to provide a mathematical advantage. Other educational and socio-cultural  factors might play a greater role in explaining individual and cross-cultural  differences in arithmetic at this age.

R. Luria's system of tracing the development of cognitive abilities during the ontogenetic process, the present study attempted to follow spatial ability along with verbal, praxic, mnemonic, and perceptual abilities, in their changing organizational interaction during development. One hundred public elementary school children between the ages of 6 and 12 were administered a mental rotation and right/left discrimination task along with a visuospatial perception test, two verbal abilities tests, a less verbally loaded mental rotation test, a test of personal right/left discrimination ability and finally, a test of the conceptual understanding of symbolic coordinates.    The interaction of test patterns suggested that new strategies were being used by different age groups on several tasks indicating functional interpretations of developmental changes in performance which are of theoretical importance.

We assessed whether a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based algorithm for the personalized optimization of cerebral oxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass combined with a restrictive red cell transfusion threshold would reduce perioperative injury to the brain, heart, and kidneys. Methods. In a randomized controlled trial, participants in three UK centres were randomized with concealed allocation to a NIRS (INVOS 5100; Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA)-based patient-specific' algorithm that included a restrictive red cell transfusion threshold (haematocrit 18%) or to a generic' non-NIRS-based algorithm (standard care). The NIRS algorithm aimed to maintain cerebral oxygenation at an absolute value of > 50% or at > 70% of baseline values. The primary outcome for the trial was cognitive function measured up to 3 months postsurgery. Results. The analysis population comprised eligible randomized patients who underwent valve or combined valve surgery and coronary artery bypass grafts using cardiopulmonary bypass between December 2009 and January 2014 (n=98 patient-specific algorithm; n=106 generic algorithm). There was no difference between the groups for the three core cognitive domains (attention, verbal memory, and motor coordination) or for the non-core domains psychomotor speed and visuo-spatial skills. The NIRS group had higher scores for verbal fluency; mean difference 3.73 (95% confidence interval 1.50, 5.96). Red cell transfusions, biomarkers of brain, kidney, and myocardial injury, adverse events, and health-care costs were similar between the groups. Conclusions. These results do not support the use of NIRS-based algorithms for the personalized optimization of cerebral oxygenation in adult cardiac surgery.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	https://doi.org/10.1111/1469-7610.00162	BACKGROUND: The present study sought to examine the specificity, developmental correlates, nature and pervasiveness of imitation deficits very early in the  development of autism. METHODS: Subjects were 24 children with autism (mean age 34  months), 18 children with fragile X syndrome, 20 children with other developmental  disorders, and 15 typically-developing children. Tasks included manual, oral-facial,  and object oriented imitations, developmental measures, joint attention ability, and  motor abilities. RESULTS: Children with autism were found to be significantly more  impaired in overall imitation abilities, oral-facial imitation, and imitations of  actions on objects than children in all of the other groups. Imitation skills of  young children with fragile X syndrome were strongly influenced by the absence or  presence of symptoms of autism. For children with autism, imitation skills were  strongly correlated with autistic symptoms and joint attention, even when  controlling for developmental level. For comparison groups, imitation was related to  other developmental abilities including play, language, and visual spatial skills.  Neither motor functioning nor social responsivity accounted for a significant amount  of variance in imitation scores, when controlling for overall developmental level,  which accounted for much of the variation in imitation ability. CONCLUSIONS: Simple  imitation skills were differentially impaired in young children with autism, and  lack of social cooperation did not account for their poor performance. In autism,  imitation skills clustered with dyadic and triadic social interactions and overall  developmental level, but were not related to play or language development. For  comparison children, all these areas were inter-related. Hypotheses about a specific  dyspraxic deficit underlying the imitation performance in autism were not supported.

Study design We report correlations between regional white matter microstructure as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) and cognitive outcome in a homogeneous group of adolescents with d-TGA. Subjects with d-TGA (n = 49) and controls (n = 29) underwent diffusion tensor imaging and neurocognitive testing. In the group with d-TGA, we correlated neurocognitive scores with FA in 14 composite regions of interest in which subjects with d-TGA had lower FA than controls. Results Among the patients with d-TGA, mathematics achievement correlated with left parietal FA (r = 0.39; P =.006), inattention/hyperactivity symptoms correlated with right precentral FA (r = -0.39; P =.006) and left parietal FA (r = -0.30; P =.04), executive function correlated with right precentral FA (r = -0.30; P =.04), and visual-spatial skills correlated with right frontal FA (r = 0.30; P =.04). We also found an unanticipated correlation between memory and right posterior limb of the internal capsule FA (r = 0.29; P =.047). Conclusion Within the group with d-TGA, regions of reduced white matter microstructure are associated with cognitive performance in a pattern similar to that seen in healthy adolescents and adults. Diminished white matter microstructure may contribute to cognitive compromise in adolescents who underwent open-heart surgery in infancy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Twenty-two severe TBI subjects and 30 mild to moderate TBI subjects, recruited from consecutive hospital admissions and classified on the basis of their lowest recorded Glasgow Coma Scale scores, were compared to 20 traumatically injured, non-head injured control subjects. Their initial evaluation (Time 1) took place within one month of injury or, for more severely injured subjects, within one month of resolution of post-traumatic amnesia. Subjects were reevaluated approximately three months after their initial evaluation (Time 2). The principal measure of interest was the California Verbal Learning Test for Children, a word list-learning task assessing verbal learning, recall after delay periods, and recognition memory. Also administered were measures of word knowledge, confrontation naming, auditory attention, spatial ability, and nonverbal reasoning and problem solving. At Time 1, severe TBI subjects' verbal memory performance was characterized by relatively equivalent impairments in learning, recall after short and long delays, and recognition accuracy, with an elevated percentage of intrusion responses in free recall and elevated false positive responding on recognition testing. This pattern of memory performance was most consistent with a mild encoding deficit. Also at Time 1, the severe TBI group displayed deficits in confrontation naming, auditory attention, spatial ability, and nonverbal reasoning and problem solving, but general verbal ability was not impaired. At Time 2, all of the groups demonstrated improved memory performance, suggesting practice effects. Severe TBI subjects continued to perform more poorly than controls in their learning and recognition accuracy, but their mean scores at Time 2 were within the average range. Also at Time 2, severe TBI subjects displayed continuing difficulty with confrontation naming and nonverbal reasoning and problem solving. Contrary to expectations, the mild to moderate TBI group did not distinguish itself from control subjects at Time 1 or Time 2 on any of the cognitive measures; there was no indication of a verbal retrieval deficit, which would have suggested brain injury primarily to subcortical structures.

Objective: Our goal was to identify demographic and nutritional factors that are associated with As exposure and the influence of this exposure on cognitive function in school-age children. Methods: We recruited 602 children 6-8 years of age living within 3.5 km of a metallurgic smelter complex in the city of Torreón, Mexico, to participate in a cross-sectional evaluation. Of these, 591 had complete anthropometry, iron, and zinc status by biochemical measurements in serum, blood lead concentration (PbB), and arsenic in urine (UAs), and 557 completed several cognitive performance tests. Results: The mean for UAs was 58.1 ± 33.2 μg/L; 52% of the children had UAs concentrations > 50 μg/L, and 50.7% of children had PbB ≥ 10 μg/dL. UAs concentration was associated with low socioeconomic status. Nutritional status indicators were not related to UAs concentrations. Linear and logistic regressions adjusted for hemoglobin concentration, PbB, and sociodemographic confounders showed a significant inverse association between UAs and Visual-Spatial Abilities with Figure Design, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the WISC-RM Digit Span subscale, Visual Search, and Letter Sequencing Tests (p < 0.05). Boys excreted significantly more UAs (p < 0.05) and were affected on different cognitive areas than girls. Conclusions: Children living in an area contaminated with both As and lead showed that As contamination can affect children's cognitive development, independent of any effect of lead.

The object moved at 0.25 Hz and was either occluded at the center of the trajectory (for 0.3 s) or at one turning point (for 0.7 s). Each trial lasted for 20 s. Both eye and head movements were measured. By using two kinds of motion, sinusoidal (varying velocity) and triangular (constant velocity), infants' ability to take velocity change into account when predicting the reappearance of the moving object was tested. Over the age period studied, performance at the central occluder progressed from almost total ignorance of what happened to consistent predictive behavior. From around 12 weeks of age, infants began to form representations of the moving object that persisted over temporary occlusions. At around 5 months of age these representations began to incorporate the dynamics of the represented motion. Strong learning effects were obtained over single trials, but there was no evidence of retention between trials. The individual differences were profound.

While the emergence of these skills has been the focus of much research on human children, little is known about ontogenetic patterns shaping spatial cognition in other species. Comparative developmental studies of nonhuman apes can illuminate which aspects of human spatial development are shared with other primates, versus which aspects are unique to our lineage. Here we present three studies examining spatial memory development in our closest living relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (P. paniscus). We first compared memory in a naturalistic foraging task where apes had to recall the location of resources hidden in a large outdoor enclosure with a variety of landmarks (Studies 1 and 2). We then compared older apes using a matched memory choice paradigm (Study 3). We found that chimpanzees exhibited more accurate spatial memory than bonobos across contexts, supporting predictions from these species' different feeding ecologies. Furthermore, chimpanzees - but not bonobos - showed developmental improvements in spatial memory, indicating that bonobos exhibit cognitive paedomorphism (delays in developmental timing) in their spatial abilities relative to chimpanzees. Together, these results indicate that the development of spatial memory may differ even between closely related species. Moreover, changes in the spatial domain can emerge during nonhuman ape ontogeny, much like some changes seen in human children. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Tactual–visual tasks, requiring visual recognition of shapes that had previously been felt but not seen, were given to full-term and preterm children at 2 ages, 1 and 11 years. Cross-modal performance showed a left-hand advantage at 11 years and, for both groups, cross-age correlations were significant when tactual exploration at 11 years was done with the left hand (r = .34–.36). The continuity showed some specificity in that the infant measure did not relate to other types of cross-modal performance at 11 years and was not dependent on aspects of spatial ability involving form perception. This continuity accounted for most of the previously reported relation of infant cross-modal ability to 11-year IQ.

Infancy measures, obtained at 7-months and 1-year, included visual and tactual recognition memory, crossmodal transfer, object permanence, and visual attention; eleven-year measures included perceptual speed, memory, spatial ability, verbal ability, and IQ. Two of the infancy measures (7-month visual recognition memory and 1-year cross-modal transfer) predicted 11-year IQ. Most of the infancy measures were related to perceptual speed, even with IQ controlled, and were selectively related to other 11-year abilities, independent of both speed and IQ. These findings reinforce the notion of cognitive continuity from infancy. Specifically they suggest that the infancy measures share a common core (perceptual speed) but that some of the measures may also tap other conceptually distinct abilities.

database	ROSEN, MARILYNNE SUE	1980	thesis	THE CEREBRAL DOMINANCE OF ARITHMETIC ABILITIES IN YOUNG CHILDREN: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/cerebral-dominance-arithmetic-abilities-young/docview/303063348/se-2?accountid=11531	Over the past several decades there have been increasing efforts to understand the neuropsychological aspects of learning disorders, especially reading disabilities. Relatively little work has been conducted on arithmetic abilities. Those investigations which have studied arithmetic have led to contradictory conclusions on which cerebral hemisphere is dominant for these skills. Some recent evidence by Rourke and Finlayson (1978) revealed clear trends for right hemisphere dominance of simple arithmetic abilities with older learning disabled children. The aim of the current study is to determine if this right hemisphere dominance would be found with young school-age children with no known learning problems. To study this relationship the neuropsychological test batteries of 46 first-grade children were examined. The subjects were divided into three groups based on their WRAT Reading and Arithmetic grade-equivalent scores. In group 1 Reading scores were four or more months higher than Arithmetic scores (the Good Reading-Poor Arithmetic group); in group 2 Reading and Arithmetic scores were less than four months apart (the Reading = Arithmetic group); and in group 3 Arithmetic scores were four or more months higher than Reading scores (the Poor Reading-Good Arithmetic group). There were no significant differences between groups on the factors of sex, laterality, and age. Four classes of dependent variables (verbal, visual-spatial, motor, and somatosensory) were examined using multivariate analysis of covariance procedures with WISC-R Full Scale IQ as the covariate. In contrast to what had been predicted, there was no evidence that the Poor Reading-Good Arithmetic group had better visual-spatial skills than the Good Reading-Poor Arithmetic group. Thus, the hypothesis of a right hemisphere superiority for arithmetic skills in young children was not supported. In contrast, some tentative evidence suggests that simple arithmetic abilities might be more of a left hemisphere function in this population. The results of this study were contrasted with those of Rourke and Finlayson (1978). It was suggested that two major differences in the populations of the two studies might explain the discrepant results. First, Rourke and Finlayson (1978) used older subjects, who might be expected to have more clearly lateralized functions than the young children in the current study. Secondly, in the former study a learning disabled population was used, whereas a nondisabled sample was used in the present study. It was suggested that qualitative neurological differences may exist between the two populations, such that predictions from one group may not be applicable to the other. Suggestions for future research involve the inclusions of normal controls in studies with learning disabled populations, replacing the WRAT with a measure including a Reading Comprehension subtest, and designing longitudinal studies to investigate the development of cerebral lateralization. As the data stand here, the issue of the cerebral dominance of arithmetic abilities in young children remains unresolved.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Surgical innovation	https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350610392064	BACKGROUND: In children, video game experience improves spatial performance, a predictor of surgical performance. This study aims at comparing laparoscopic virtual  reality (VR) task performance of children with different levels of experience in  video games and residents. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 32 children (8.4 to  12.1 years), 20 residents, and 14 board-certified surgeons (total n = 66) performed  several VR and 2 conventional tasks (cube/spatial and pegboard/fine motor).  Performance between the groups was compared (primary outcome). VR performance was  correlated with conventional task performance (secondary outcome). RESULTS: Lowest  VR performance was found in children with low video game experience, followed by  those with high video game experience, residents, and board-certified surgeons. VR  performance correlated well with the spatial test and moderately with the fine motor  test. CONCLUSIONS: The use of computer games can be considered not only as pure  entertainment but may also contribute to the development of skills relevant for  adequate performance in VR laparoscopic tasks. Spatial skills are relevant for VR  laparoscopic task performance.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

American journal of medical genetics	https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.1320580115	Our objective was to investigate whether the previously-described neurocognitive pattern in girls with Ullrich-Turner syndrome is found in childhood and adolescence;  we used a prospective, controlled study of neurocognitive development in girls with  Ullrich-Turner syndrome. The patients included 56 girls with Ullrich-Turner  syndrome, and 100 normal age- and verbal IQ-matched female control subjects, whose  ages ranged from 6-14 years. All girls with Ullrich-Turner syndrome and the normal  control girls received a battery of neurocognitive tests designed to evaluate the  following domains: general cognition, memory, academic achievement, language,  visual-spatial/perceptual skills, visual-motor skills, attention, and affect  recognition. Our results demonstrated consistent findings in Ullrich-Turner syndrome  girls across the age range studied. In general, the Ullrich-Turner girls resembled  control subjects in terms of verbal and language abilities. We found relatively  depressed performance IQ and a significant verbal IQ-performance IQ difference.  Significant differences were observed on examination of nonverbal abilities. The  Ullrich-Turner girls performed more poorly than control girls on 1) tests of  visual-motor skills including the Beery Test of Visual-Motor Integration, the  Perceptual Organization Factor, and the Rey-Osterrieth Figures; 2) tests of  visual-spatial skills, including the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test; 3) tests of  attention, including the Freedom From Distractibility Factor; and 4) the Affective  Prosody Affect Recognition Test. Ullrich-Turner subjects showed evidence of  multifocal or diffuse right cerebral dysfunction and deficits generally involving  nonverbal skills that may be due to X chromosome monosomy, gonadal dysgenesis, or  both. Future studies will examine the role of estrogen replacement on cognitive  function in Ullrich-Turner syndrome individuals.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The complex phenotype includes ovarian failure, a characteristic neurocognitive profile and typical physical features. TS features are associated not only with complete monosomy X but also with partial deletions of either the short (Xp) or long (Xq) arm (partial monosomy X). Impaired visual-spatial/perceptual abilities are characteristic of TS children and adults of varying races and socioeconomic status, but global developmental delay is uncommon. The cognitive phenotype generally includes normal verbal function with relatively impaired visual-spatial ability, attention, working memory, and spatially dependent executive function. The constellation of neurocognitive deficits observed in TS is most likely multifactorial and related to a complex interaction between genetic abnormalities and hormonal deficiencies. Furthermore, other determinants, including an additional genetic mechanism, imprinting, may also contribute to cognitive deficits associated with monosomy X. As a relatively common genetic disorder with well-defined manifestations, TS presents an opportunity to investigate genetic and hormonal factors that influence female cognitive development. TS is an excellent model for such studies because of its prevalence, the well-characterized phenotype, and the wealth of molecular resources available for the X chromosome. In the current review, we summarize the hormonal and genetic factors that may contribute to the TS neurocognitive phenotype. The hormonal determinants of cognition in TS are related to estrogen and androgen deficiency. Our genetic hypothesis is that haploinsufficiency for gene/genes on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp) is responsible for the hallmark features of the TS cognitive phenotype. Careful clinical and molecular characterization of adult subjects missing part of Xp links the TS phenotype of impaired visual spatial/perceptual ability to specific distal Xp chromosome regions. We demonstrate that small, nonmosaic deletion of the distal short arm of the X chromosome in adult women is associated with the same hallmark cognitive profile seen in adult women with TS. Future studies will elucidate the cognitive deficits and the underlying etiology. These results should allow us to begin to design cognitive interventions that might lessen those deficits in the TS population. Copyright © 2006 S. Karger AG.

We tested neuropsychological measures of memory, attention, visual-spatial abilities, visual-motor skills, and language. We examined the influence of age, handedness, genetic aspects (parental origin of the extra X chromosome, CAGn repeat length, and pattern of X inactivation), and previous testosterone treatment on cognition. We studied 50 boys with KS (4.1-17.8 years). There was a significant increase in left-handedness (P = 0.002). Specific language, academic, attentional, and motor abilities tended to be impaired. In the language domain, there was relative sparing of vocabulary and meaningful language understanding abilities but impairment of higher level linguistic competence. KS boys demonstrated an array of motor difficulties, especially in strength and running speed. Deficits in the ability to sustain attention without impulsivity were present in the younger boys. Neither genetic factors examined nor previous testosterone treatment accounted for variation in the cognitive phenotype in KS. The cognitive results from this large KS cohort may be related to atypical brain lateralization and have important diagnostic and psychoeducational implications. The difficulty in complex language processing, impaired attention and motor function in boys with KS may be missed. It is critical that boys with KS are provided with appropriate educational support that targets their learning challenges in school in addition to modifications that address their particular learning style. These findings would also be an important component of counseling clinicians and families about this disorder. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Verbal abilities are, in general, normal; however, women with TS, as a group, have specific deficits in visual-spatial abilities, visual-perceptual abilities, motor function, nonverbal memory, executive function, and attentional abilities. Observed deficits could be caused by genetic or endocrine factors. Objective: To evaluate the specific cognitive deficits that appear to persist in adulthood, are not estrogen-responsive, and may be genetically determined. Methods: The cognitive performance of adult women with TS (n = 71) who were estrogen repleted was compared with verbal IQ- and socioeconomic status-matched female controls (n = 50). Sixty-one women with TS had ovarian failure and received estrogen replacement and 10 had preserved endogenous ovarian function and were not receiving estrogen replacement at the time of evaluation. Results: Similar to children and adolescents with TS, adults with TS have normal verbal IQ but have relative difficulty on measures of spatial/perceptual skills, visual-motor integration, affect recognition, visual memory, attention, and executive function despite estrogen replacement. These deficits are apparent in women with TS despite apparently adequate estrogen effect, either endogenous or by hormone replacement. Conclusion: The cognitive phenotypes of adults with TS, with or without ovarian failure, are similar, indicating that estrogen replacement does not have a major impact on the cognitive deficits of adults with TS.

Methods: Neuropsychological evaluation of general cognitive ability, language, memory, attention, visual-spatial abilities, visual-motor skills, and motor function. Results: Study cohort: 21 boys with 47,XYY and 93 boys with 47,XXY (KS), age 4-17 years, and 36 age-matched control boys. Both the XYY and KS groups performed less well, on average, than the controls on tests of general cognitive ability, achievement, language, verbal memory, some aspects of attention, and executive function, and motor function. The boys with XYY on average had more severe and pervasive language impairment, at both simple and complex levels, and the boys with KS on average had greater motor impairment in gross motor function and coordination, especially in running speed and agility. Conclusions: The results from these large XYY and KS cohorts have important neurocognitive and educational implications. From the neurocognitive standpoint, the presenting findings afford an opportunity to gain insights into brain development in boys with XYY and those with KS. From the educational standpoint, it is critical that boys with XYY or KS receive appropriate educational interventions that target their specific learning challenges. These findings also provide important information for counseling clinicians and families about these disorders. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Revista de neurologia		INTRODUCTION: A neuropsychological test battery for 5 to 16 year old children has recently been developed. This battery is called Neuropsychological Assessment of  Children (Evaluacion Neuropsicológica Infantil, ENI) and it includes the following  sections: attention, constructional skills, memory encoding, perceptual skills,  memory recall, language, metalinguistic skills, reading, writing, arithmetic,  spatial skills, conceptual skills and executive functions. AIMS: Our aim was to  obtain norms for the ENI in a Colombian population between 5 and 16 years of age.  SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We selected 252 children (92 boys and 160 girls) in the city  of Manizales (Colombia), and they were administered the ENI. In order to obtain an  external validity, 21 of the participants were also given the Wechsler Intelligence  Scale for Children Revised (WISC R). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences  were found on most of the subtests across age groups. Differences between boys and  girls appeared more specifically in tests of visuoperceptual, visual constructional,  spatial and numerical skills. Some of the ENI subtests correlated with the WISC R  subtests. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that the ENI could satisfy the existing need  in the Spanish speaking world for neuropsychological tools with which to assess  children and adolescents.

Child development		Children's ability to discriminate reflections and rotations of visual stimuli was examined using a kinetic imagery task. It was hypothesized that success would be  related to the number and placement of orientation markers on the stimuli, as well  as whether or not reflections had to be discriminated from simple rotations. 40 4-  and 5-year-old children were directed to imagine how a stimulus would look if  rotated to a specified location and asked to indicate the appearance of the  reoriented stimulus by selecting the correct option from a number of foils. 48 of  the items required only discrimination of a reoriented stimulus. The other 48 also  required discrimination of a reflection of the reoriented stimulus. Stimuli differed  in the number of orientation cues on the edges of the figures. Results revealed that  prediction accuracy was associated with the existence of orientation markers on the  stimuli, as well as age, sex, type of discrimination, and several interactions among  the variables. Findings were discussed in comparison to a priori predictions based  on an analysis of how children might use orientation information when performing  mental rotation tasks.

Genetic, social, and general psychology monographs		We examined children's ability to anticipate the appearance of transformed multicomponents using visual stimuli with variations of a mental rotation task. We  hypothesized that (a) performance would depend on the presence, location, and  spatial relationship of specific stimulus features, and that (b) younger children  would use a single component to make their predictions, whereas older children would  be more likely to use multiple components. In Study 1, 40 first-, and fifth-grade  subjects were presented with 32 rotation problems consisting of varied stimulus  characteristics; subjects selected the correct option from a field where foils were  indicative of the strategy used. Analyses of variance and log linear analyses  revealed the hypothesized stimulus effect differentially associated with the  children's ages. In Study 2, sixty 5-, 7-, and 9-year olds confronted 64 mental  rotation problems with multicomponent stimuli and a construction task. Results and  implications confirmed those of Study 1.

It was hypothesized that success would be affected by both characteristics of the stimulus and by the subtlety of the discrimination required. Forty 3- to 4-year-old children were directed to mentally rotate a stimulus a given number of degrees and to discriminate the appearance of the rotated stimulus from among a set of alternatives. Four stimuli differing in the number of visual orientation cues were utilized across 24 trials. A significant effect was found for number of orientation cues, and data indicated the difficulty children experienced detecting reflections, a task which bears close resemblance to the yes/no option in prototypic rotation studies. Children were only successful with a limited range of stimuli when discrimination of a reflected foil was not required. Results are discussed in light of discrepant findings about children's kinetic imagery ability and the advisability of using this particular paradigm with young Children. © 1985.

Since both actions and context can vary, a number of different combinations can be specified. In this study, the relationships among eight such combinations were examined and predicted patterns compared with observed ones. Fifty-four 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children were presented with 24 geometric displays depicting a variety of geometric relations. Subjects were required to either match or recall the displays in both a reconstruction and a recognition task format thereby responding across different types of action demands. The geometric displays depicted information organized either around a single axis (horizontal or vertical) or around both axes, the variation in context. The results of a mixed design ANOVA revealed a good fit with the hypothesized predictions. The findings are discussed in terms of the development of spatial skills, information theory, and of skill generalization. © 1984.

Kaufman's (1975) factor analytic model (Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organization, and Freedom from Distractibility) and Bannatyne's (1974) psychoeducational model (Verbal Conceptualization, Spatial Ability, Sequencing, and Acquired Knowledge) were compared in a concurrent validity design, followed by a test of their respective "clinical utility" through linear discriminant function analyses. Two intermediate constructs were hypothesized to be areas of relative deficit among emotionally-disturbed children: Freedom from Distractibility and Acquired Knowledge. Their construct validity was examined with reference to selected scales of the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery-Children's Revision (LNNB-CR).    Results indicated that the emotionally-disturbed group did possess a relative deficit on Distractibility and Acquired Knowledge relative to their control peers, though the deficit was not within the abnormal range on either construct. With full scale intelligence controlled for, no other WISC-R intermediate scores manifested a significant difference between groups. Each interpretative model demonstrated generally equivalent clinical utility in the differentiation between groups; stepwise analyses selected Freedom from Distractibility as the best discriminating variable between the groups. However, neither model demonstrated an efficacy level adequate for individual psychodiagnostics. The emotionally-disturbed group performed significantly worse than the control group on all neuropsychological variables, though well within the normal range of functioning. Freedom from Distractibility was inferred to be a short-term memory construct, rather than as a measure of attention/concentration. The construct validity of Acquired Knowledge was not specifically inferred, though it appeared to represent more of a numerical facility than as a global educational index. The best discrimination between groups occurred on an item analysis of the LNNB-CR Pathognomonic scale. This unexpected result, if replicated, extends the efficacy of the Pathognomonic scale to the domain of psychodiagnostic assessment.

Neuropediatrics	https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1247518	BACKGROUND: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute, inflammatory-demyelinating disorder of the CNS with a favourable outcome in the  majority of cases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the long-term  outcome of children with an initially severe form of ADEM. METHODS: Children with  ADEM according to the criteria of the International Pediatric MS Study Group  (IPMSSG) referred to the rehabilitation centre Vogtareuth were included.  Neurological impairment was evaluated with a standardized telephone-based interview  assessing the EDSS score. Neuropsychological outcome was assessed with review of the  medical records and a standardized parental questionnaire (KOPKIJ). RESULTS: Twelve  children (1 year 9 months to 13 years of age) were included. All children had  focal-neurological signs and changes in mental status at presentation and an MRI of  the brain showing a range of white and gray matter lesions. 11/12 patients with a  mean follow-up of 6.2 years (2-13.6 years) had a monophasic course of the disease.  One child had a multiphasic ADEM. Two children had an EDSS score of 0, three an EDSS  of 2, five an EDSS between 3 and 5 and two children had an EDSS score of 6 and 9.  Results of a standardized parental questionnaire (KOPKIJ) revealed that 7 children  had deficits in the categories alertness, memory, school performance, visual-spatial  skills and/or impulse control. CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate that  children with an initially severe manifestation of ADEM continue to have in the  majority of cases neurological and neuropsychological handicaps.

Group 1 was composed of children who were uniformly deficient in reading, spelling, and arithmetic; children in Group 2 were relatively adept at arithmetic as compared to their performance in reading and spelling; Group 3 was composed of children whose reading and spelling performances were average or above, but whose arithmetic performance was relatively deficient. The performances of these children on 16 dependent measures were compared. The performances of Groups 1 and 2 were superior to that of Group 3 on measures of visual-perceptual and visual-spatial abilities; Group 3 performed at a superior level to that of Groups 1 and 2 on measures of verbal and auditory-perceptual abilities. The results are discussed in terms of the relationships between varying patterns of academic abilities and patterns of brain-related behaviors, and the nature of the neuropsychological abilities that may limit performance on arithmetic calculation tasks. © 1978 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.1983.tb00515.x	20 children with idiopathic precocious puberty, 27 adolescents with clinically delayed puberty, and an equivalent number of controls matched for age, sex, and IQ were given a battery of tests. These included measures of verbal and spatial abilities and a task assessing hemispheric lateralization using a dichotic listening procedure. Comparisons with matched controls revealed poorer verbal and spatial abilities for precocious males and poorer verbal, but better spatial, abilities for precocious females. Delayed developing males demonstrated superior verbal skills compared with controls, whereas delayed developing females did more poorly than controls in both verbal and spatial areas. On the dichotic task, the only group differing from controls was the delayed developing males, who demonstrated stronger lateral asymmetries. It was suggested that the present findings, which are not consistent with those of former investigations, may reflect methodological differences between studies and the disruptive influence of atypical pubertal onset on normal patterns of sex difference in cognitive functioning.

Journal of pediatric psychology	https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/15.6.775	Examined neurocognitive functions in 63 newly diagnosed pediatric patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) at onset of illness (T0) and 1 year  postdiagnosis (T1). Siblings (S) serving as controls were assessed at T0 only.  Subjects were given age-appropriate tests of verbal and visuospatial abilities. In  addition, DM were interviewed regularly during diabetes clinic to determine current  diabetic control and different intervening glycemic-related events. Results revealed  no differences between DM and S at T0, nor any specific impairment in DM predating  illness. Also, DM did not demonstrate any acquired impairment after 1 year of  illness. Children with early onset DM (less than 5 years) scored lower in spatial  ability at T0 and T1 than children with later onset DM, who scored lower in verbal  ability. Episodes of asymptomatic and mild chronic hypoglycemia correlated  positively, not negatively, with improved outcome over time. There were no adverse  effects of severe hypoglycemia. Ketonuria and hospitalizations were associated with  lower performance IQs 1 year after onset, as was diabetic ketoacidosis at onset.  Results are discussed in terms of critical periods of sensitivity of different brain  regions to the effects of diabetes and the need for longer follow-up of these  children.

Results revealed significant underachievement by subjects with TS, which reflected their poorer performance on problems requiring the retrieval of addition and multiplication facts and procedural knowledge for addition and division operations. TS subjects did not differ qualitatively from controls in type of procedural error committed. Study 2, which compared the performance of 10 subjects with TS and 31 controls on the Keymath Diagnostic Arithmetic Test, showed that the TS group had less adequate knowledge of arithmetic, subtraction, and multiplication procedures but did not differ from controls on Fact items. Error analyses revealed that TS subjects were more likely to confuse component steps or fail to separate intermediate steps or to complete problems. TS subjects relied to a greater degree on verbal than visual-spatial abilities in arithmetic processing while their visual-spatial abilities were associated with retrieval of simple multidigit addition facts and knowledge of subtraction, multiplication, and division procedures. Differences between the TS and control groups increased with age for Keymath, but not WRAT-R, procedures. Discrepant findings are related to the different task constraints (timed vs. untimed, single vs. alternate versions, size of item pool) and the use of different strategies (counting vs. fact retrieval). It is concluded that arithmetic difficulties in females with TS are due to less adequate procedural skills, combined with poorer fact retrieval in timed testing situations, rather than to inadequate visual-spatial abilities. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Purpose of this study is to explore associations between metabolic syndrome and cognitive impairment in U.S. adolescents using population-based data. Study Design: Participants included adolescents aged 12-16 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III. The main outcome measures included assessments of cognitive function using Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) tools. The WRAT-R consisted of mathematics and reading tests. The WISC-R consisted of block design test, which measures spatial visualization and motor skills, and digit span test, which measures working memory and attention. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between metabolic syndrome and cognitive function. We used education levels of the family reference person, while controlling for education levels because of missing data. Results: Presence or absence of metabolic syndrome was tested in 1170 of 2216 NHANES III participants aged 12-16 years. Regression models showed that participants with metabolic syndrome scored an average 1.25 [95% confidence interval (CI) = -2.14 to -0.36] points lower in reading examination and an average 0.89 (95% CI = -1.65 to -0.13) points lower in digit span examination, compared to those without metabolic syndrome. In addition, components of metabolic syndrome - elevated systolic blood pressure and increased waist circumference (WC) - were associated with impaired working memory/attention, and higher fasting glucose and increased WC were associated with poorer reading test scores. Conclusions: Metabolic syndrome was associated with impaired reading, working memory, and attention among adolescents. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

Although research has reported changes in spatial memory abilities during  childhood and elderly age, no study has assessed reference frames processing during  the entire lifespan using the same task. Here, we aimed at providing some  preliminary data on the capacity to process reference frames in 283 healthy  participants from 6 to 89 years of age. A spatial memory task requiring  egocentric/allocentric verbal judgments about objects in peri-/extrapersonal space  was used. The main goals were: (1) tracing a baseline of the normal process of  development of these spatial components; (2) clarifying if reference frames are  differently vulnerable to age-related effects. Results showed a symmetry between  children of 6-7 years and older people of 80-89 years who were slower and less  accurate than all other age groups. As regards processing time, age had a strong  effect on the allocentric component, especially in extrapersonal space, with a  longer time in 6- to 7-year-old children and 80- to 89-year-old adults. The  egocentric component looked less affected by aging. Regarding the level of spatial  ability (accuracy), the allocentric ability appeared less sensitive to age-related  variations, whereas the egocentric ability progressively improved from 8 years and  declined from 60 years. The symmetry in processing time and level of spatial ability  is discussed in relation to the development of executive functions and to the  structural and functional changes due to incomplete maturation (in youngest  children) and deterioration (in oldest adults) of underlying cerebral areas.

Through the literature review, the operations of visual thinking, including visual strategy, visual memory, mental rotation, visual patterning, and visual reasoning were named. The assessment was developed by specifying tasks requiring student demonstration of visual skills. Criteria and standards for judging student performance of these tasks were established.    Eleven identified talented fourth, fifth, and sixth graders participated in the testing. The researcher trained five classroom teachers to administer and score the assessment.    The validity of the assessment was determined through review by a qualified educational leader and by questionnaires answered by the examiners and students. The reliability of the assessment was tabulated by double scoring student work by two different raters which provided convincing evidence of reliability in scoring procedures.    It was shown how a student's strengths and weaknesses could be ascertained by reviewing a student's sub scores on the assessment. The information gathered about the students' performance as visual thinkers from the assessment appears to directly correspond with their past school performance. This accord adds validity to the assessment and the assessment procedures.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Whereas the overall response times were equal for shapes in both groups, for letters they were slower in dyslexics. For letters as well as for shapes, however, the same mental-rotation effects were obtained between the groups. The results are interpreted as support for the notion of developmental dyslexia as a deficit in functional coordination between graphemic and phonological letter representations.

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	https://doi.org/10.1080/09297040490920168	This study examines mental rotation ability in children with developmental dyslexia. Prior investigations have yielded equivocal results that might be due to differences  in stimulus material and testing formats employed. Whereas some investigators found  dyslexic readers to be impaired in mental rotation, others did not report any  performance differences or even superior spatial performance for dyslexia. Here, we  report a comparison of mental rotation for letters, three-dimensional figures sensu  Shepard and Metzler, and colored pictures of animals or humans in second-grade  German dyslexic readers. Findings indicate that dyslexic readers are impaired in  mental rotation for all three kinds of stimuli. Effects of general intelligence were  controlled. Furthermore, dyslexic children were deficient in other spatial abilities  like identifying letters or forms among distracters. These results are discussed  with respect to the hypotheses of a developmental dysfunction of the parietal cortex  or a subtle anomaly in cerebellar function in dyslexic readers.

Although child prodigies are often the object of historical wonder and modern day awe, because of the difficulty involved with assembling a large sample of prodigies, until recently, little was known about the source of their achievements. Recent studies have begun to tackle this enigma, and a few traits have surfaced as key underpinnings of prodigiousness across domains: an average or higher IQ, extraordinary working memory, and a heightened attention to detail. The present study investigated whether the prodigies' cognitive profiles differed according to their area of specialty. Using the Stanford Binet 5th ed. intelligence test the investigator assessed the cognitive profiles of 18 child prodigies across the domains of art, music, and math. The results suggest that prodigies in each domain have distinct cognitive profiles. While all of the child prodigies had exceptional memories, the music and math prodigies scored significantly higher on working memory than the art prodigies. The math prodigies displayed the highest levels of general intelligence and extraordinary visual spatial skills. The art prodigies displayed a surprising deficit in visual spatial skills, obtaining scores much lower than both the math prodigies and music prodigies. The differences in the prodigies' cognitive underpinnings across domains may have implications for the general population. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Recently, much of this debate took place within the context of considering the abilities of exceptional musicians. Several of such studies suggested that general intelligence and domain specific skills, both of which fall on the nature side of the spectrum, play a significant role in the development of musical abilities. In this paper, the author demonstrates that those studies which attempted to argue for a purely nurture-driven account of such musical talent, moreover, merely showed that practice has some role to play in the development of talent; they failed to rule out the possibility that factors such as general intelligence and domain specific skills also contribute to the development of exceptional performance abilities. If the evidence generated by studies of exceptional musicians provides a strong basis for believing that nature is the primary driver of exceptional talent, that evidence receives a powerful boost from recent studies of child prodigies. Child prodigies provide a particularly fascinating view on the nature versus nurture debate because of the extremely young age at which the prodigies demonstrate their remarkable abilities, thus, limiting the extent to which their abilities can be solely the result of extreme dedication to practice. Despite this fact, some have still argued that child prodigies' abilities are nurture-driven. Recent research, however, demonstrates that child prodigies' skills are highly dependent on a few features of their cognitive profiles, including elevated general IQs, exceptional working memories, and elevated attention to detail. Other innate characteristics of the child prodigies predict the domain in which the prodigies will excel. Music prodigies, for example, tend to score better with respect to their general IQs, visual spatial abilities, and working memories, than art prodigies. This new research on a group of exceptional - and exceptionally young - performers strongly supports nature as the primary driver of extreme talent. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Influence of the stereotyped nature of the items on children's mental-rotation performance	Learning and Individual Differences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2015.08.016	This study inquired the influence of stimulus features on children's mental-rotation performance with novel gender-stereotyped test versions (M-MRT and F-MRT) administered to 290 elementary-school children (147 second graders and 143 fourth graders; age: M = 8.87, SD = 1.09). No significant gender difference and no significant interaction of gender and stimulus type could be demonstrated. Multiple regression revealed that mental-rotation performance was predicted by perceptual speed and stimulus type (female or male stereotyped) but not by the perceived stereotyped nature or the perceived familiarity of the stimuli. As expected the objects used in the M-MRT were more familiar to boys than to girls, while the objects used in the F-MRT were more familiar to girls than to boys. Furthermore, the cube figures (based on Shepard & Metzler, 1971) were perceived as more male stereotyped. Overall, findings suggest that stimulus attributes influence mental-rotation performance. Results can be discussed with regard to the influence of the stimulus characteristics of Shepard and Metzler's cube figures on the large gender differences in tests in which these figures are used. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Participants included 321 elementary school children who completed three-dimensional mental-rotation tasks with either male- or female-stereotyped stimuli (M-MRT-3D/F-MRT-3D). Results suggest that in-depth tasks are very difficult for second graders. No gender effect was found in the mental-rotation performance of 7- to 9-year-old children; however, task understanding indicates gender differences. For fourth graders, a significant interaction of gender and stimulus type could be demonstrated. Furthermore, results indicate that fourth-grade boys tend to guess more often in tasks with stimuli consistent to the respective own gender. In addition, regression analyses showed that next to grade and perceptual speed, the perceived level of stimulus familiarity predicted performance. Considering a possible link between dimensionality and familiarity, the influence of the gender-stereotyped stimuli on children’s confidence and task understanding as well as on transformational processes and strategy efficiency is discussed. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This study tested the hypothesis that girls and boys solve mental-rotation tests with female- or respectively male-stereotyped objects faster and more correctly. 116 fourth-graders solved a chronometric mental-rotation test with either female- or male-stereotyped action-based objects as stimulus material and reported their solution strategies and familiarity with handling the objects in real life. Boys reacted faster than girls only in the male-stimuli condition, while gender differences were inversed in the female-stimuli condition. All children were faster with gender-congruent material, probably provoked by gender-schematic processing or stereotype lift effects. Furthermore, analytic solving strategies appeared as efficient as holistic strategies in gender-congruent conditions, while holistic strategies were more advantageous only in gender-incongruent conditions. The congruence of stimulus material and gender best predicted children’s reaction time. Practical implications are considered regarding the importance of diverse and gender-equalised material to assess mental-rotation skills. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The theory and research described in the thesis examines the psychological and educational purpose of measuring the ZPD within the context of children's representational skills. The first chapter discusses the development of children's ability to understand and use spatial representations. Recent research in developmental psychology is criticised for measuring the ZPD and claiming that the ZPD corresponds to children's individual developmental level. The experiments in Chapter 2 show that previous research has overestimated the representational ability of young children and that a children's potential development is different from their actual development, as assessed by the ZPD. Chapter 3 examines the origins of Vygotsky's sociocultural theory and the ZPD within Soviet psychology and Hegelian philosophy. The next chapter presents contemporary interpretations of the ZPD which have to varying degrees attempted to extend this concept. The idea of dynamic assessment is introduced in this chapter and experiments using this notion are described in detail. Preliminary studies are described in Chapter 5, which examine the possible need for measurement of the ZPD and they also choose appropriate samples, methods and apparatus for future experiments which aim to measure the ZPD within a spatial task. The sixth chapter consists of three experimental studies, which all attempted to measure the ZPD using dynamic assessment techniques. These studies showed that measurement of the ZPD could provide important diagnostic information about children's spatial ability beyond that given by individual tests of intelligence. This was especially true in the case of children with learning difficulties. The results of all the experiments in the thesis are discussed in relation to measurement of the ZPD and its value within developmental psychology and educational psychology.

Journal of Neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1348/174866407X272448	The syndrome of non-verbal learning disabilities (NLD) is associated with prominent non-verbal deficits such as reduced perceptual and spatial abilities, against a background of relatively intact verbal abilities. Asperger syndrome is one of the several developmental disorders for which Byron Rourke has claimed that almost all the signs and symptoms of NLD are present. This study investigated the claim utilizing a battery of neuropsychological tests that were found to be sensitive to NLD in the original learning disordered populations used to describe the syndrome. Children aged between 8 and 14 were recruited to form two groups: (I) children with Asperger syndrome (N = 14) and (2) normal healthy schoolchildren (N = 20). By contrast to the main principle outlined in the NLD model, children with Asperger syndrome did not display a relative difficulty with spatial- or problem-solving tasks; indeed, they displayed significantly higher performance on some non-verbal tasks in comparison with verbal tasks. It was only in relation to their high levels of psychosocial and interpersonal difficulties, which are also predicted on the basis of their psychiatric diagnosis, that the children with Asperger syndrome were clearly consistent with the NLD model in this study. These results raise questions about the relevance of the syndrome of NLD for children with Asperger syndrome. © 2009 The British Psychological Society.

When we attempt to safely cross a busy street, follow a ball's position during a sporting event, or monitor children in a busy playground, we rely on our brain's capacity to selectively attend to and track the position of specific objects in a dynamic scene. This ability to visually track simultaneously moving objects in a continuously changing and multisensory environment is a critical component of nearly all forms of visual-motor coordination. While methods for assessing Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) in adults are well established, due to challenges associated with designing a MOT task suitable for young children, we have little understanding of MOT abilities under the age of 5 years. To better understand how and when young children learn to track multiple objects, we designed, implemented and evaluated TrackFX, the first game-based MOT task running on a touch tablet designed for children as young as 30 months old. We present findings from an empirical study of 31 children between the age of 30 and 58 months and implications for game-based learning. © 2013 The Author(s).

The neuropsychological studies carried out to date on WS children pointed out a specific deficit in spatial abilities. Some researchers have reported examples of impoverished and disorganized drawings produced by WS adolescents. The present report focuses on the early development of visual spatial processing in a WS Italian child. This is an important and unique corpus of data both because of its longitudinal design, and because it focuses on a period of development which has not been examined in detail in other studies of this population. A WS child - Elisa - has been tested longitudinally over a period of four years, beginning at age 2.05 and continuing to the present (she is now 6.07). Data have been collected in a variety of settings, including both regular therapy sessions in her home and experimental testing in the laboratory. Therapy sessions are conducted twice a week, and laboratory testing is scheduled approximately once a month. In this report, we will focus on the patterns of change in Elisa's drawing of houses and people, as well as on her production of abstract geometric forms. Elisa attempted to copy geometric fonns (a circle and irregular lines) for the first time when she was four years old. Five months later Elisa produced her first free drawings of a person. At 4.08 year of age she was able to draw simple irregular closed forms. Between the age of 5.00 and 5.08, the change observed in Elisa's drawing is gradual. It consisted primarily in the elaboration of the details of her figures of people. At the age 5.07 she learned to draw the form of the house. During this period, all of Elisa's spontaneous drawings consisted in single figures. The major advance during the period from 5.08 to 6.07 is the shift to compositional drawings. Elisa has begun to combine features, placing people in scenes with other people, houses, grass, sun and other objects. The longitudinal data presented confirm difficulties in spatial abilities of WS subjects. Our subject, in comparison with normal children, shows a delayed but not atypical development of drawing abilities. Her capacity of using speech to direct and describe drawings is discussed with particular reference to therapeutic intervention.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		AE	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Through the spatial operation capacity framework (van Niekerk, 1997; Yakimanskaya, 1991) that guides the development of the mathematics in this study, children are exposed to activities that require them to act on a variety of physical and mental objects and transformations to develop spatial skills. Children use 3-D figures, 2-D representations of 3-D figures, verbal representations, and a dynamic computer interface to solve spatial problems.

Yet, little is known about the postnatal androgen surge, that occur around three-months of age. Preliminary research suggests that higher levels of postnatal testosterone may also result in the masculinization of some sex-typed behaviors (e.g., visual preferences and toy preferences). The primary purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the relationship between postnatal testosterone and behaviors in early childhood, including behaviors characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorders.     Sixty-six children, between 4- and 7-years of age, and their parents participated in this study. Saliva samples were obtained and assayed for testosterone levels when children were 3- to 4-months of age. Second to fourth digit ratios were measured and used as indicators of prenatal testosterone exposure. Parents completed one self-report questionnaire (Autism Spectrum Quotient) and several parent-report questionnaires (Autism Spectrum Quotient-Children’s Version, Empathy Quotient-Children’s Version, Systemizing Quotient-Children’s Version, and Child Behavior Checklist), while children participated in various experimental tasks (Expressive One Word Picture Vocabulary Test, Playmate and Play Style Preferences Structured Interview, mental rotation task, two false belief tasks, an emotion recognition task, and an eye-tracking task).     Overall, lower digit ratios, indicative of greater prenatal testosterone exposure, were associated with more masculine behaviors. For example, lower digit ratios were predictive of less time required to complete a mental rotation task and were correlated with lower empathy scores, smaller vocabularies, lower emotion recognition scores and less visual interest in viewing the eye portion of faces. A novel finding of this study was that higher postnatal testosterone levels at 3-months of age were predictive of less visual interest in people compared to objects at 5-years of age. This finding supports the idea that the postnatal surge of testosterone that occurs in early infancy could have organizational effects on behavior, especially behaviors required for socialization. However, future research establishing a link between postnatal testosterone and behaviors beyond early childhood is required before establishing this postnatal phase as another critical period for the development of later behaviors.

Its development is affected by numerous factors such as general intelligence, problem-solving skills, gender, playing building games, experience with engineering drawing and 3D modelling, etc. The study aimed to explore how engineering 3D modelling with SketchUp computer programme affects the development of students’ spatial thinking and visualization in consideration of previous experience with 3D modelling and students’ grades in Technics and Technology. The study included 166 11–14-year-old students who were assigned to an experimental and a control group. A pre-and post-test were applied for initial and final testing. To test students’ spatial visualization abilities, an experimental tool with the following elements was assembled: Picture Rotation Test, Form Board Test, The Punched Holes Test, Differential Aptitude Test: Space Relations, The Surface Development Test, Mental Rotation Test, Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Rotations. The experimental group was included in 30-h training in 3D modelling with SketchUp. The results have shown an excellent response of students in the experimental group to the training and confirmed the expectations concerning the improvement of spatial visualization abilities of these students irrespective of their previous experience and school grades in Technics and Technology. The study has shown that introducing spatial modelling with SketchUp in early technics and technology education enables more effective development and improvement of children’s spatial visualization ability skills. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

The density of this biomarker (macular pigment optical density; MPOD) has been positively correlated with cognitive functioning via measures of global cognition, processing speed, and visual-spatial abilities, among others. Although improvements in cognitive function have been found in adults, much less is known about how L and Z intake may support or improve cognitive functioning during periods of rapid developmental change, such as childhood and pre-adolescence. This study examined the relationship between MPOD and cognitive functioning in 51 7–13-year-old children (51% female). MPOD was measured using heterochromatic flicker photometry (HFP) optimized for this age group. Cognitive function was assessed using the Woodcock-Johnson III (composite standard scores were obtained for Brief Intellectual Ability, Verbal Ability, Cognitive Efficiency, Processing Speed, and Executive Processes). In this sample, MPOD was significantly related to Executive Processes, r(47) = 0.288, p < 0.05, and Brief Intellectual Ability, r(47) = 0.268, p < 0.05. The relationship to Cognitive Efficiency was positive and trending but not significant, r(49) = 0.206, p = 0.074. In general, these data are consistent with those of adults showing a link between higher carotenoid status and improved cognitive functioning. © 2018 by the authors.

Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR	https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12688	BACKGROUND: Recently, a study using the subjective straight-ahead task showed that individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) present a bias in the representation of body  perception. The aim of the present study is to examine the horizontal midline body  representation in WS participants using the bisection line task, which is an  important benchmark for an egocentric frame of reference. METHOD: Fifteen WS  participants (mean age = 21.7 ± 9.5 years) were compared with two typical  development control groups: one composed of 15 participants matched on chronological  age and one composed of 15 children matched on mental age. The task consisted of  dividing each line in a series of 18 lines into two equal halves by drawing a  vertical mark with a pencil in the centre of the line. RESULTS: Individuals with WS  presented a significant leftward bias in comparison to mental age and chronological  age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The leftward deviation in WS could be linked to the body  representation bias and difficulties in the development of the egocentric reference  system. An early detection of such deviation should help in the development of  targeted interventions for WS individuals to improve visual-spatial skills and  learning.

More recently, a substantial number of studies have begun to look at a population thought to be at risk for alcohol abuse, the children of alcoholics. Individuals at risk for the development of alcoholism often display the same cognitive deficits as alcoholics and it has been suggested that these deficits may be a factor in the development of alcoholism. The present study examined cognitive functioning in male and female adult children of male alcoholics (FH+) and controls (FH$-$) on measures of spatial processing to explore the specific components of spatial processing that may be impaired in adult children of alcoholics. Additional measures of information processing were included to examine specific components of information processing impaired in ACAs. The potential moderating influence of gender and verbal ability on performance was also examined. Ninety FH+ subjects and 106 FH$-$ subjects were matched on age and WAIS-R vocabulary scores. Results of a paired associate learning task revealed that for high verbal ability subjects, FH+ females performed significantly poorer than FH$-$ females, while FH+ and FH$-$ males did not significantly differ. However, for low verbal ability subjects, FH$-$ females performed significantly poorer than FH+ females, while FH+ and FH$-$ males did not significantly differ. Results of a mental rotation task revealed poorer performance for FH+ than FH$-$ subjects who were high verbal, while the reverse was observed for low verbal subjects. FH+ females performed significantly worse than FH$-$ females on the digit symbol but no effects of family history were observed for males. Results of the digit span backwards indicated male FH+ subjects performed significantly worse than male FH$-$ subjects, but the reverse was observed for females. Family history effects that varied according to gender were also observed for the Sternberg task. The result suggest the necessity of considering gender and the verbal ability when conducting studies of individuals at risk for alcoholism.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The sample consisted of 832 adolescents, evenly divided by race (black or white) and sex. Within both racial groups, males outscored females on all of the spatially-oriented subtests, but females outscored males on a subtest emphasizing rote memory. The similarity of patterning of sex differences within each racial group might be interpreted as indicating that something more than social experience alone is involved in this phenomenon. © 1983.

EBON and 17 controls were examined with within and cross-modality (visual and auditory) word stem completion tasks together with tasks requiring free-recall and recognition for visually and auditory presented words. Compared to age-matched controls, EBON was found to show a significant deficit of visual priming following visual presentation, and a deficit approaching significance following auditory presentation. Explicit memory and visual and spatial abilities were not significantly different from controls. Therefore, EBON represents the first childhood case establishing the role of occipital regions in visual priming, as well as illustrating a profile of surface reading difficulty as a developmental consequence of this locus of lesion.

Human factors	https://doi.org/10.1177/00187208211018110	OBJECTIVE: Developing and validating a novel domain-agnostic, computer-based training tool for enhancing 2D cross-section understanding of complex 3D structures.  BACKGROUND: Understanding 2D cross-sections of 3D structures is a crucial skill in  many disciplines, from geology to medical imaging . It requires a complex set of  spatial/visualization skills including mental rotation, spatial structure  understanding, and viewpoint projection. Prior studies show that experts differ from  novices in these skills. METHOD: We have developed a novel training tool for  inferring 2D cross-sections of 3D structures using a participatory design  methodology. We used a between-subject study design, with 60 participants, to  evaluate the training tool. Our primary effectiveness evaluation was based on pre-  and postspatial tests that measured both cross-section abilities and specific  spatial skills: viewpoint, mental rotation, and card rotation. RESULTS: Results  showed significant performance gains on inferring 2D cross-sections for participants  of the training group. Our tool improves two other spatial skills as well: mental  rotation and viewpoint visualization. CONCLUSION: Our training tool was effective  not only in enhancing 2D cross-section understanding of complex 3D structures, but  also in improving mental rotation and viewpoint visualization skills. APPLICATION:  Our tool can be beneficial in different fields such as medical imaging, biology,  geology, and engineering. For example, an application of our tool is in  medical/research labs to train novice segmenters in ongoing manual 3D segmentation  tasks. It can also be adapted in other contexts, such as training children, older  adults, and individuals with very low spatial skills.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

By 9 years of age, children, like adults, code the location of an object in a homogeneous space at two levels (fine-grained and categorical) and combine this information when reporting location. For points within a circle, multi-level location coding occurs for both radius and angle. Before age 9 years, children employ hierarchical coding only radially. It was hypothesized that younger children may either be unable to encode and/or process two dimensions simultaneously, or to impose the frame of reference required for angular subdivision. Tasks were designed to test these two hypotheses: one reduced the relevant dimensions required for coding, the other provided the frame of reference. Results indicate that 7-year-olds are able to form angular categories when the number of dimensions for coding is reduced, and that an explicit frame of reference does not facilitate mature angular category division. The acquisition of adult forms of spatial representation appears to be limited by encoding and/or processing capacities, rather than by spatial abilities. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

Children's ability to use maps for navigational purposes is a task in which these domains necessarily intersect. This study was designed to examine 6-year-olds' complex route formation and reorientation skills. Thirty-six kindergarteners navigated through a large-scale environment using a map. Participants were required to plan their own routes to end-points designated only on the maps. Success at navigation, as well as route length and types of error, were assessed. The results indicate that kindergartners are able to use maps to plan and execute routes, and that they demonstrate advance planning skills by reliably selecting optimally efficient routes.

We studied the association between stunting and child's neuro-psychological outcomes at 6-8 years of age in rural Burkina Faso using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd edition (KABC-II), the Children's Category Test 1 (CCT-1) and the Test of Variable of Attention (TOVA). Methods: We re-enrolled children of a previously community-based Exclusive breastfeeding trial in Burkina Faso. We assessed a total of 532 children aged 6-8 years using KABC-II for memory (Atlantis and Number Recall subtests), spatial abilities (Conceptual Thinking, Face Recognition and Triangle subtests), reasoning (Block Counting subtest), general cognition and CCT-1 for cognitive flexibility. A total 513 children were assessed using the TOVA to measure attention and inhibition. We calculated the Cohen's d to examine the effect size and conducted a linear regression to examine the association. Results: The proportion of stunting was 15.6% (83/532). Stunted children performed significantly poorer for memory (Atlantis and Number Recall), spatial abilities (Conceptual Thinking, Face Recognition and Triangle), general cognition and attention with a small effect size compared to non-stunted children. Children who were exposed scored significantly higher errors for cognitive flexibility and inhibition with a small effect size compared to unexposed children. At standardized and unstandardized multivariable regression analysis, stunted children performed significantly poorer for Atlantis (p = 0.001), Number Recall (p = 0.02), Conceptual Thinking (p = 0.01), Triangle (p = 0.001), general cognition (p ≤ 0.0001) and attention (p = 0.04) compared to non-stunted children. Children who were exposed scored significantly higher errors for cognitive flexibility (p = 0.02) and for inhibition (p = 0.02) compared to unexposed children. We adjusted all the results for age, schooling, sex, playing, father education, mother employment and promotion of previous exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusion: Stunting is associated with poorer neuro-psychological outcomes among children in rural Burkina Faso. Initiatives related to prevention need to be established and advice on nutrition need to be provided. © 2018 The Author(s).	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

PeerJ	https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3507	BACKGROUND: In Burkina Faso, it is not uncommon for mothers to drink alcohol, even during pregnancy. We aimed to study the association between maternal alcohol  consumption during pregnancy and the child's cognitive performance using the Kaufman  Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd edition (KABC-II) and the Children's Category  Test Level 1 (CCT-1) in rural Burkina Faso. METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study  of a community cluster-randomised Exclusive breastfeeding trial, and re-enrolled the  children in rural Burkina Faso. A total of 518 children (268 boys and 250 girls)  aged 6-8 years were assessed using the KABC-II and the CCT-1. We examined the effect  size difference using Cohen's d and conducted a linear regression analysis to  examine the association. RESULTS: Self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy  was 18.5% (96/518). Children whose mothers reported alcohol consumption during  pregnancy performed significantly poorly for memory and spatial abilities tests from  small effect size difference for 'Atlantis' (0.27) and 'Triangle' (0.29) to moderate  effect size difference for 'Number recall' (0.72) compared to children whose mothers  did not consume alcohol during pregnancy; the exposed children scored significantly  higher errors with a small effect size (0.37) at problem solving (CCT-1) test  compared to unexposed children. At unstandardized and standardized multivariable  analysis, children whose mothers reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy  performed significantly poorer for memory-'Atlantis' (p = 0.03) and 'Number recall'  (p = 0.0001), and spatial ability tests-'Triangle' (p = 0.03); they scored  significantly higher errors at problem solving CCT-1 test (p = 0.002); all the  results were adjusted for age, sex, schooling, stunting, father's education,  mother's employment and the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding. No statistical  association was found for visual abilities-'Conceptual Thinking', 'Face  recognition', 'Story completion', and reasoning tests-'Rover', 'Block counting', and  'Pattern Reasoning'. CONCLUSION: Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is  associated with poorer cognitive performance for memory, spatial ability, and  problem solving tests in the offspring in rural Burkina Faso. Futures studies needs  to assess in more detail the maternal alcohol consumption patterns in Burkina Faso  and possible preventive strategies.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Mental rotation is an important component of this intellectual potential. In this study, we examined the effect of an intervention program on the performance of a mental-rotation task and the transfer of learning to a visualization test. As gender differences in spatial abilities are decreasing, we expected that the intervention would be equally beneficial for boys and girls. The sample was made up of 218 participants (108 boys and 110 girls), mean age of 14 years. A 2 × 2 (intervention × sex) factorial design was employed. Treatment consisted of task performance on 12 mental-rotation worksheets during a 2-month interval, with pre- And posttreatment evaluations of the criterion variables. Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistical techniques, which showed that the treatment produced the expected effects. Relevant consequences for education and research are discussed.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In addition, other factors influencing spatial skills were examined (e.g. child’s age, parents’ level of education). Using a correlational quantitative design, 75 preschoolers in eight Head Start classrooms were observed three times during their free play time. An existing instrument was used (TOSA: Verdine & Golinkoff, 2018) to measure children’s spatial skills. In addition, children’s parents reported the amount of time children played with spatial toys at home. Boys spent more time playing in block center than girls, however, there was no significant difference between boys’ and girls’ spatial skills. Children who spent more time in the block center scored higher in the spatial test, and a trend emerged suggesting time in the block area might benefit girls more than boys. Child’s age and parents’ level of education were predictors of spatial skills, but they did not moderate the relationship between spatial skills and the amount of time children spent in block center. The findings highlight the potential of playing with blocks in developing and improving spatial skills. Teachers and administrators should provide more opportunities for children to improve their spatial skills, especially children who are from low SES families. This study had some limitations such as the small sample size and the limited observation time. There is a need for more investigations and experiment to find strategies to engage children in spatial play and support the improvement of their spatial skills.

In a previous study (Sasaki, 1981), input modality had not affected the performance of perspective transformation in adult subjects; the present work was to analyse this modality effect developmentally. The two most important theoretical standpoints of the nature and the development of imagery have been advanced by Piaget & Inhelder (1966) and by Kosslyn (1978a, b). Piaget seemed to rule out the notion that images were derived from perception and developmentally it was operative aspect of cognition that produced changes in imagery. Kosslyn claimed imagery was a quasi-pictorial (perceptual) representation and suggested that young children tended to use imagery more than adults do. The former seemed to hypothesize that input modality did not affect spatial transformation in children while the latter considered this effect as probable. To clarify this theoretical problem was the second purpose of this experiment. © 1982, The Japanese Association of Educational Psychology. All rights reserved.

As such, functional spatial representation might be thought of as a spatial mental model. Two studies examined the development of functional spatial representation and examined whether it might be an instantiation of a general ability to construct and use mental models, one that arises sometime between 2 and 3 years of age. Study 1 examined the spatial ability children 30, 36 and 42 months of age by examining their search for objects hidden in a long rectangular sandbox. Results of Study 1 demonstrate a robust spatial representational ability. Children across all ages were equally successful in completing the search tasks, searching accurately (1) for a single object after a 2min delays (2) for 2 identical objects and (3) transposing a landmark-target relation in order to find a target hidden in a novel location.    Study 2 examined whether functional spatial representation is an instantiation of a domain-general symbolic ability to form mental models. Children completed the landmark transposition task, as well as a nonverbal calculation task. Results again demonstrated robust ability to form spatial representations across the ages studied, while significant differences in the ability to calculate emerged. These findings suggest that representational abilities in the spatial domain may be developmentally prior to those involved in early calculation.

The sample group comprised 249 children aged 14-17 years from about 50 Russian schools. The group was divided into two subgroups: 1) 132 adolescents, 81 girls and 51 boys, with high general IQ (hereafter - gifted); 2) 117 teenagers, 66 girls and 51 boys, with average IQ. Scores of 11 intellectual abilities were measured by the Universal Test of Intelligence Investigation "UIT". The program SPSS Statistics 20 was applied for processing mathematical data. The main results are that only adolescents with high IQ show the sexual dimorphism of intellectual abilities: girls have better results than boys at verbal (p=0.001), spatial abilities (p=0.05), short-term memory (p=0.001); boys have better results at mathematic abilities (p=0.001). Adolescents with average IQ didn't show sex diff erences in the level of cognitive abilities. This fact allows to suggest that the level of IQ is an important factor for prediction sex diff erences in a cognitive development. The gifted girls show higher spatial abilities than boys (it is unusual among diff erent researches of this topic). One of the factors of giftedness is the increased level of testosterone in the early stage. Testosterone for women has positive correlation with the level of spatial abilities, men have negative correlation. The sex diff erences caused by high testosterone can explain the higher scores for gifted girls.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

There were 55 children of whom 23 were NH and 32 had CP, the latter consisting of 12 who could stand and walk unaided (CP-Walk) and 20 confined to a wheelchair (CP-Wheel). All groups were divided into two age ranges (5-8 and 9-13 year) and were tested on two occasions separated by an interval of 12 months. On both occasions, testing involved three consecutive tasks: making perceptual (pre)judgments about the passability of an opening varying in width, actually attempting to locomote through the openings (performance), and another round of (post)judgments. Judgments and performance were expressed in terms of absolute and relative outcomes, the latter differing from the former in accounting for differences in body width relative to aperture width. There were two main findings. Firstly, the younger CP-Walk children were the least able to employ body- scaled information in judging aperture width and the older CP-Wheel and NH the most able. Secondly, when performances in passing through the openings were adjusted for differences in body width, all groups had similar outcomes. This finding lends credence to the notion that when action is used in the service of perception, this is beneficial for the visual-spatial abilities of both NH and CP children. The study concludes by pointing out future directions in this type of research as well as some of the clinical implications of the findings.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The disabilities have been hypothesized to be related to deficits in cognitive representational ability. Anticipatory imagery and spatial representation have been reported as two nonlinguistic representational areas in which language-disordered children are deficient. The present study compared normal and language-disabled children on spatial representation tasks involving anticipatory imagery. Five spatial tasks were administered to two groups of 7 1/2 -9 1/2 -year-old children matched on sex, age, native language, and racial background. One group included 18 language-disabled children and the other group 18 children with normal language development. The language-disabled were less accurate than the normal children on all tasks which involved anticipation or prediction of mental rotations, movements, or other transformations. The results of this study suggest difficulty with dynamic cognitive representation in the linguistic and nonlinguistic deficits demonstrated by language-disabled children.

Similarly, mental activity during sleep tends to covary with age. This review aims to analyze the characteristics of dreaming and disturbing dreams at different age brackets. On the one hand, dreams may be considered an expression of brain maturation and cognitive development, showing relations with memory and visuo-spatial abilities. Some investigations reveal that specific electrophysiological patterns, such as frontal theta oscillations, underlie dreams during sleep, as well as episodic memories in the waking state, both in young and older adults. On the other hand, considering the role of dreaming in emotional processing and regulation, the available literature suggests that mental sleep activity could have a beneficial role when stressful events occur at different age ranges. We highlight that nightmares and bad dreams might represent an attempt to cope the adverse events, and the degrees of cognitive-brain maturation could impact on these mechanisms across the lifespan. Future investigations are necessary to clarify these relations. Clinical protocols could be designed to improve cognitive functioning and emotional regulation by modifying the dream contents or the ability to recall/non-recall them. © 2019 by the authors.

Although there has been a considerable amount of research concerning the influence of estrogen on sexually dimorphic behaviours, there has been a dearth of investigations on the role of testosterone (T) in these behaviours in women. The studies presented here were undertaken to elucidate the role of T in sexually-dimorphic aspects of psychological functioning in women. In Study 1, users and non-users of oral contraceptives were tested with a battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires at two different phases of the menstrual cycle. Results showed that women with chronic low levels of free T induced by oral contraceptives demonstrated better verbal fluency and visuospatial memory performance and reported lower levels of verbal aggression than naturally-cycling women whose free T levels were within the normal female range. Furthermore, although self-ratings of hostility fluctuated across test sessions concomitant with changes in free T levels, performance on cognitive tests did not appear to be influenced by the fluctuations in T levels across the menstrual cycle. In Study 2, women with elevated free T levels due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) demonstrated worse verbal fluency, verbal memory, manual dexterity, and visuospatial working memory performance, but reported higher levels of anger than healthy, matched control women. Women with PCOS also reported lower levels of sexual cognition and arousal than healthy controls. In Study 3, women with PCOS were randomly assigned to receive 3 months of treatment with an anti-androgen or placebo. Anti-androgen treatment resulted in significant reductions in free T levels and in improvements in verbal fluency performance. Taken together, the results of these three studies suggest that T has a detrimental effect on aspects of cognitive functioning in women, particularly on verbal fluency, verbal memory, and visuospatial memory. The cumulative results also suggest that T may enhance aspects of aggressive behaviours and sexual functioning in women. However, we failed to find any effect of T on mental rotation, spatial perception, or spatial visualization.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Seventeen healthy siblings served as a comparison group. Children with anterior cerebral infarcts (n = 7) showed deficits in attention and executive skills, whereas children with more widespread cerebral infarcts (n = 18) showed additional deficits in spatial skills. The volume of cerebral infarction was associated with spatial and language performance, but minimally related to performance in other cognitive domains.

Major findings are as follows: Movement to the new location significantly improved perspective-taking scores but did not improve coordination scores, and with respect to coordination scores, movement resulted in the substitution of one type of egocentric error for another. Results are interpreted to mean that the self is an important referent for calculating spatial transformations.

Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	https://doi.org/10.1196/annals.1360.013	The spatial abilities of a large sample of 10 and 11 year olds were tested after they listened to contemporary pop music, music composed by Mozart, or a discussion about the present experiment. After being assigned at random to one of the three listening experiences, each child completed two tests of spatial abilities. Performance on one of the tests (square completion) did not differ as a function of the listening experience, but performance on the other test (paper folding) was superior for children who listened to popular music compared to the other two groups. These findings are consistent with the view that positive benefits of music listening on cognitive abilities are most likely to be evident when the music is enjoyed by the listener.

Choline supplementation (3.5 g/L in 0.02 M saccharin solution in tap water) was maintained for two weeks before birth and for up to four weeks postnatally. Additional supplementation was maintained from the fifth to the tenth week postnatally. Spatial-learning capacities were studied at the ages of 26, 65, or 80 days in a circular swimming pool (Morris place-navigation task) and at the age of 7 months in a homing arena. Treatment effects were found in both juvenile and adult rats, and thus persisted for several months after the cessation of the supplementation. The choline supplementation improved the performance in the water maze in a very selective manner. The most consistent effect was a reduction in the latency to reach a cued platform at a fixed position in space, whereas the improvement was limited when the platform was invisible and had to be located relative to distant cues only. However, after removal of the goal cue, the treated rats showed a better retention of the training position than did the control rats. A similar effect was observed in a dry-land task conducted in the homing arena. The choline supplementation thus induced a significant improvement of spatial memory. But since this effect was only evident following training with a salient cue, it might be regarded as an indirect effect promoted by an optimal combination of cue guidance with a place strategy. © 1995, Psychonomic Society, Inc..

In addition, the effect of intrahippocampal grafts of fetal septal-diagonal band tissue, rich in cholinergic neurons, was studied in some of these subjects. The rats received bilateral cell suspensions when aged 23-24 months. Starting 4 weeks after grafting, they were trained during 5 weeks in an 8-arm maze made of connected plexiglass tunnels. No age-related impairment was detected during the first eight trials, when the maze shape was that of a classical radial maze in which the rats had already been trained when young. The older rats were impaired when the task was made more difficult by rendering two arms parallel to each other. They developed an important neglect of one of the parallel tunnels resulting in a high amount of errors before completion of the task. In addition, the old rats developed a systematic response pattern of visits to adjacent arms in a sequence, which was not observed in the younger subjects. None of these behaviours were observed in the old rats with a septal transplant. Sixteen weeks after grafting, another experiment was conducted in a homing hole board task. Rats were allowed to escape from a large circular arena through one hole out of many, and to reach home via a flexible tube under the table. The escape hole was at a fixed position according to distant room cues, and olfactory cues were made irrelevant by rotating the table between the trials. An additional cue was placed on the escape position. No age-related difference in escape was observed during training. During a probe trial with no hole connected and no proximal cue present, the old untreated rats were less clearly focussed on the training sector than were either the younger or the grafted old subjects. Taken together, these experiments indicate that enriched housing conditions and spatial training during adult life do not protect against all age-related deterioration in spatial ability. However, it might be that the considerable improvement observed in the grafted subjects results from an interaction between the graft treatment and the housing conditions. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

Learning to program computers has gained considerable popularity, and educational systems around the world are encouraging students in schools and even children in kindergartens to engage in programming activities. This popularity is based on the claim that learning computer programming improves cognitive skills, including creativity, reasoning, and mathematical skills. In this meta-analysis, we tested this claim performing a 3-level, random-effects meta-analysis on a sample of 105 studies and 539 effect sizes. We found evidence for a moderate, overall transfer effect (g = 0.49, 95% CI [0.37, 0.61]) and identified a strong effect for near transfer (g = 0.75, 95% CI [0.39, 1.11]) and a moderate effect for far transfer (g = 0.47, 95% CI [0.35, 0.59]). Positive transfer to situations that required creative thinking, mathematical skills, and metacognition, followed by spatial skills and reasoning existed. School achievement and literacy, however, benefited the least from learning to program. Moderator analyses revealed significantly larger transfer effects for studies with untreated control groups than those with treated (active) control groups. Moreover, published studies exhibited larger effects than gray literature. These findings shed light on the cognitive benefits associated with learning computer programming and contribute to the current debate surrounding the conceptualization of computer programming as a form of problem solving.

The Future of children	https://doi.org/10.1353/foc.0.0004	Marie Evans Schmidt and Elizabeth Vandewater review research on links between various types of electronic media and the cognitive skills of school-aged children  and adolescents. One central finding of studies to date, they say, is that the  content delivered by electronic media is far more influential than the media  themselves. Most studies, they point out, find a small negative link between the  total hours a child spends viewing TV and that child's academic achievement. But  when researchers take into account characteristics of the child, such as IQ or  socioeconomic status, this link typically disappears. Content appears to be crucial.  Viewing educational TV is linked positively with academic achievement; viewing  entertainment TV is linked negatively with achievement. When it comes to particular  cognitive skills, say the authors, researchers have found that electronic media,  particularly video games, can enhance visual spatial skills, such as visual  tracking, mental rotation, and target localization. Gaming may also improve  problem-solving skills. Researchers have yet to understand fully the issue of  transfer of learning from electronic media. Studies suggest that, under some  circumstances, young people are able to transfer what they learn from electronic  media to other applications, but analysts are uncertain how such transfer occurs. In  response to growing public concern about possible links between electronic media use  and attention problems in children and adolescents, say the authors, researchers  have found evidence for small positive links between heavy electronic media use and  mild attention problems among young people but have found only inconsistent evidence  so far for a link between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and media use.  The authors point out that although video games, interactive websites, and  multimedia software programs appear to offer a variety of possible benefits for  learning, there is as yet little empirical evidence to suggest that such media are  more effective than other forms of instruction.

Developmental medicine and child neurology	https://doi.org/10.1017/s0012162201002109	Understanding patterns of gyrification in neurogenetic disorders helps to uncover the neurodevelopmental etiology underlying behavioral phenotypes. This is  particularly true in Williams syndrome (WS), a condition caused by de novo deletion  of approximately 1 to 2 Mb in the 7q11.23 region. Individuals with WS  characteristically possess an unusual dissociation between deficits in  visual-spatial ability and relative preservations in language, music, and social  drive. A preliminary postmortem study reported anomalous gyri and sulci in  individuals with WS. The present study examined gyrification patterns in 17  participants with WS (10 females, 7 males; mean age 28 years 11 months, SD 8 years 6  months) and 17 age- and sex-matched typically developing control participants (mean  age 29 years 1 month, SD 8 years 1 month) using new automated techniques in MRI.  Significantly increased cortical gyrification was found globally with abnormalities  being more marked in the right parietal (p=0.0227), right occipital (p=0.0249), and  left frontal (p=0.0086) regions. These results suggest that one or more genes in the  7q11.23 region are involved during the critical period when cortical folding occurs,  and may be related to the hypothesized dorsal/ventral dissociation in this  condition.

Rather than considering these different systems as independent entities, each with its own separate developmental trajectory, researchers have begun to entertain the idea that perceptual and motor systems develop interdependently, or are functionally related, and influence each other throughout the course of development. This conception of development, herein called “perception-action” coupling, underlies a great deal of current research and theory on the development of perceptual and motor systems. This paper reviews perceptual-motor development, discussing different views of the relationship between perception and action systems, along with examining evidence of interaction between perceptual and motor abilities. Support for the idea of a functional relationship between perceptual and motor systems is found in a wide variety of areas, from research on infants' perceptions of the visual cliff to work on the development of spatial skills. Finally, the ontogeny of independent locomotion is examined, specifically focusing on the different ways in which vision is important in the growth of this motor skill. © 1993, Elsevier Science & Technology.

Predictors of map use should shift from landmark to array encoding, from mental rotation of 1 element to array rotation, and from direct perception of an array to recall. Landmark and array encoding and array rotation were measured by duplication of placements on an array when 2 arrays were aligned or 1 was rotated 180°. Matching a rotated letterlike form to a standard gauged single-element rotation; recall of landmark locations after their removal from an array indexed memory. Each rotation task and landmark placements predicted the younger children's map scores; array encoding, single-element rotation, and recall predicted older children's map errors.

Ss were 240 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 9th graders, and instruments included the Children's Embedded Figures Test and the Modern Mathematics Supplement to the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. Significant interaction effects were demonstrated between ethnic group membership and sex for both mathematical and spatial skills. In Hispanic adolescent groups, significant sex differences were found in scores on both skills in favor of the female. A similar but not significant trend was seen in the scores of Black adolescent groups. In contrast, White adolescent males scored higher than White adolescent females, but not significantly so. No prior study has reported the observed pattern of sex differences in Hispanic Ss, one that differs from that usually found in White Ss.

There is solid evidence that neuropsychological abnormalities are also present at this stage of the illness, comprising deficits in domains of attention, executive function, verbal and non-verbal memory, spatial abilities, psychomotor functions, etc. We have recently shown that early, treatment-induced improvement of negative symptoms is significantly associated with cognitive performance during a follow-up period of two years. In this study the impact of early, treatment-induced change of negative symptoms on cognitive performance during a follow-up of 2 years was examined in a larger sample of neuroleptic-naïve patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Forty-three patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV underwent a comprehensive clinical and neuropsychological test battery at the time of study inclusion and after approximately 5 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months of follow-up. A healthy comparison group with similar age, gender distribution and parental socio-economic status was also included. Patients showed marked cognitive deficits at baseline and throughout the follow-up. Early, treatment-induced improvement of negative symptoms predicted better cognitive performance at follow-up. Early, treatment-induced improvement of cognitive performance was significantly associated with less negative and psychotic symptoms. The results of this study suggest a clinical relevant association between early change in negative symptoms and cognitive outcome, and between early improvement of cognitive performance and symptomatic outcome. Negative symptoms and cognitive deficits should be considered as primary treatment targets in the early course of schizophrenia.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	3	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00097	The present experiment examined whether the mental rotation ability of 9-month-old infants was related to their abilities to crawl and manually explore objects.  Forty-eight 9-month-old infants were tested; half of them had been crawling for an  average of 9.3 weeks. The infants were habituated to a video of a simplified  Shepard-Metzler object rotating back and forth through a 240° angle around the  longitudinal axis of the object. They were tested with videos of the same object  rotating through a previously unseen 120° angle and with a mirror image of the  display. All of the infants also participated in a manual object exploration task,  in which they freely explored five toy blocks. The results showed that the crawlers  looked significantly longer at the novel (mirror) object than at the familiar  object, independent of their manual exploration scores. The non-crawlers looking  times, in contrast, were influenced by the manual exploration scores. The infants  who did not spontaneously explore the toy blocks tended to show a familiarity  preference, whereas those who explored the toy blocks preferred to look at the novel  object. Thus, all of the infants were able to master the mental rotation task but it  seemed to be the most complex process for infants who had no crawling experience and  who did not spontaneously explore objects.

Understanding the manner in which a child approaches problems seems to be imperative to the success of an educator's efforts. A study of Howard Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences offered this researcher an enlightening hypothesis. As an art educator, spatial intelligence was of special interest to this researcher.    Twenty fourth grade students familiar to the researcher according to observations noted in the art class were chosen as subjects. Ten were not viewed by this researcher as spatial learners. These students formed the control group. Ten students considered to be spatial learners by this researcher formed the test group.    Interviews, surveys, drawing tasks and a block design manipulative skill were used as instruments to obtain data. In the interview situations, the subjects were asked questions regarding their preferences of activities and whether or not they considered themselves good at various everyday life skills. Students answered with a never, sometimes or often response with the researcher following up any leads which might obtain more data and clarity.    The questions which served as the foundation for the interview were also used in the design of a survey completed by the classroom teachers of the subjects. The basis of the design of both the interview and survey was Howard Gardner's seven styles of learning also known as his "Theory of Multiple Intelligences". A pretest was conducted using the survey of the classroom teacher as well as the three drawing tasks completed by the subjects in the current study. The three drawing tasks were derived from Clark's Drawing Abilities Test.    The Block Design Subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Test was used as an additional means of testing the spatial ability of the subjects. Subjects were timed for each of nine tasks. Notes on the behavior of the subjects while completing the tasks were taken and times were recorded by the examiner.    The profiles of the subjects derived from both the interviews and the teachers' survey were examined and relationships with the Block Design Subtest and the drawing tasks were noted.    The results of this study indicate that the best instrument for identifying spatial learners is the drawing tasks. The data indicated that the correlation between the drawing tasks and the block design manipulative skill was much better than Gardner's Scale as used. Next in order of usefulness for identifying spatial learners were the block design manipulative skill and the interview of the students respectively. The least effective instrument for identifying spatial learners is the survey of the classroom teacher.    Although the drawing tasks and block design manipulative skill seem to be valid instruments in determining the spatial abilities of fourth grade students, they do not indicate the whole picture of the way children learn. However, these two measures do help delineate tasks necessary for consideration of spatial properties.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00580	Difficulties in handwriting are often reported in children with developmental coordination disorder, and they represent an important element in the diagnosis. The  present study was aimed at investigating the relation between motor coordination and  handwriting skills, and to identify differences in handwriting between children  without and with coordination difficulties. In particular, we asked whether  visual-spatial skills have a role as mediating variables between motor coordination  and handwriting. We assessed motor coordination as well as graphic abilities in  children aged 7-10 years. Moreover, we evaluated their visual-motor integration,  visual-spatial skills, and other cognitive abilities (memory and planning). We found  no relation between motor coordination and handwriting skills, while visual-spatial  skills (measured by a visual-constructive task) were related with both. Our  conclusion is that visual-spatial skills are involved both in general motor  coordination and in handwriting, but the relationship involves different aspects in  the two cases.

Developmental medicine and child neurology	https://doi.org/10.1017/s0012162201001232	The aim of this preliminary study was to examine the developing cognitive profiles of children with cerebellar tumours in a consecutive series of clinical patients.  MRI and longitudinal intellectual profiles were obtained on seven children (two  females, five males; mean age 3 years at diagnosis; mean age 7 years at first  assessment). Tumours in three of the children were astrocytomas; of the remaining  tumours, two were medulloblastomas, one low-grade glioma, and one ependymoma. In  right-handed children, we observed an association between greater damage to right  cerebellar structures and a plateauing in verbal and/or literacy skills. In  contrast, greater damage to left cerebellar structures was associated with delayed  or impaired non-verbal/spatial skills. Long-term cognitive development of the  children studied tentatively supports a role for the cerebellum in  learning/development. These findings suggest that lateralized cerebellar damage may  selectively impair the development of cognitive functions subserved by the  contralateral cerebral hemisphere and, in addition, that all children with  cerebellar lesions in early childhood should routinely undergo long-term monitoring  of their intellectual development.

Speakers must infer another’s visual perspective in order to reference objects appropriately (e.g., objects on your right may be on my left). When spatial relations are expressed via the visuospatial modality as with sign languages (e.g., American Sign Language, ASL), signers and addressees each have different, conflicting visual perspectives of the signer’s articulators. For example, in face-to-face interactions, a sign produced on the left side is perceived by the addressee on the right side. Therefore, in order to avoid miscommunication, one interlocutor must adopt the other’s visual perspective. Little is known about the cognitive mechanisms underlying the perspective-alignment process that is critical for correctly conveying and comprehending spatial descriptions in a signed language. This dissertation examines the relative contributions from inhibitory control, social skills, and mental rotation abilities on the ability to adopt another’s visual-spatial perspective during communication or when performing nonlinguistic perspective-taking tasks.   Chapter 1 provides an overview of the literature describing a) the relationships between inhibitory control, social skills, and visual-spatial perspective-taking (VSPT) abilities and b) how experience with a sign language may affect these relationships. Chapter 2 presents a study examining the relative cognitive burdens for producers and comprehenders of manual gestures from non-egocentric perspectives. Comprehending, but not producing, gestures from non-egocentric perspectives was related to inhibitory control abilities. Chapter 3 examines whether deaf ASL-signing adults approached a nonlinguistic VSPT task socially (like hearing English-speaking adults) or whether they utilized nonsocial, perceptual strategies similar to deaf children. Results suggest that deaf signing adults used a nonsocial approach to the VSPT task, possibly due to effects of language modality and/or sociocultural experiences. Chapter 4 examines whether nonlinguistic perspective-taking or mental rotation abilities are related to signers’ comprehension of perspective-dependent structures within ASL (e.g., locative classifier constructions). Correlational analyses indicated that linguistic perspective-taking was related to participants’ overall ASL abilities, nonlinguistic VSPT abilities, and (to a lesser extent) mental rotation abilities. The overall findings are discussed in terms of ramifications for educational and clinical practices as well as for understanding the relationship between spatial cognition and language.

Journal of deaf studies and deaf education	https://doi.org/10.1093/deafed/enz006	Social abilities relate to performance on visual-spatial perspective-taking (VSPT) tasks for hearing nonsigners but may relate differently to VSPT abilities for deaf  signers because of their distinct linguistic and social experiences. This research  investigated whether deaf adults approach VSPT tasks nonsocially (as previously  suggested for deaf children) or socially (as seen for hearing adults). Adult hearing  nonsigners (n = 45) and deaf signers (n = 44) performed a nonlinguistic VSPT task,  mental rotation and spatial orientation tasks, and completed a questionnaire  measuring social abilities and degree of socialness. No group differences were  observed for any of the spatial tasks. Hearing nonsigners with better social  abilities performed better on the VSPT task but deaf signers who were less social  performed better on the VSPT task. Therefore, social abilities and VSPT skill relate  differently for deaf and hearing individuals, possibly due to differences in  communication modality and/or sociocultural experiences.

Particular weakness in the otitis media group was evidenced in sequential information processing; relative strength was found in nonverbal spatial abilities involving simultaneous information processing. General and higher level verbal abilities did not appear to be affected by the otitis media condition. A link between the conductive hearing losses which generally accompany otitis media and auditory-cortical dysfunction is postulated. © 1988 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

This cognitive capability is mandatory for human survival in this folding and changing world. By means of internal representation, mental imagery offers other cognitive functions (e.g., decision making, planning) the possibility to assess information on objects or events that are not being perceived. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that humans are able to employ this ability in the early stages of infancy. Although materialisation of humanoid robot employment in the future appears to be promising, comprehensive research on mental imagery in these robots is lacking. Working within a human environment required more than a set of pre-programmed actions. This thesis aims to investigate the use of mental imagery in humanoid robots, which could be used to serve the demands of their cognitive skills as in humans. Based on empirical data and neuro-imaging studies on mental imagery, the thesis proposes a novel neurorobotic framework which proposes to facilitate humanoid robots to exploit mental imagery. Through conduction of a series of experiments on mental rotation and tool use, the results from this study confirm this potential. Chapters 5 and 6 detail experiments on mental rotation that investigate a bio-constrained neural network framework accounting for mental rotation processes. They are based on neural mechanisms involving not only visual imagery, but also affordance encoding, motor simulation, and the anticipation of the visual consequences of actions. The proposed model is in agreement with the theoretical and empirical research on mental rotation. The models were validated with both a simulated and physical humanoid robot (iCub), engaged in solving a typical mental rotation task. The results show that the model is able to solve a typical mental rotation task and in agreement with data from psychology experiments, they also show response times linearly dependent on the angular disparity between the objects. Furthermore, the experiments in chapter 6 propose a novel neurorobotic model that has a macro-architecture constrained by knowledge on brain, which encompasses a rather general mental rotation mechanism and incorporates a biologically plausible decision making mechanism. The new model is tested within the humanoid robot iCub in tasks requiring to mentally rotate 2D geometrical images appearing on a computer screen. The results show that the robot has an enhanced capacity to generalize mental rotation of new objects and shows the possible effects of overt movements of the wrist on mental rotation. These results indicate that the model represents a further step in the identification of the embodied neural mechanisms that might underlie mental rotation in humans and might also give hints to enhance robots' planning capabilities. In Chapter 7, the primary purpose for conducting the experiment on tool use development through computational modelling refers to the demonstration that developmental characteristics of tool use identified in human infants can be attributed to intrinsic motivations. Through the processes of sensorimotor learning and rewarding mechanisms, intrinsic motivations play a key role as a driving force that drives infants to exhibit exploratory behaviours, i.e., play. Sensorimotor learning permits an emergence of other cognitive functions, i.e., affordances, mental imagery and problem-solving. Two hypotheses on tool use development are also conducted thoroughly. Secondly, the experiment tests two candidate mechanisms that might underlie an ability to use a tool in infants: overt movements and mental imagery. By means of reinforcement learning and sensorimotor learning, knowledge of how to use a tool might emerge through random movements or trial-and-error which might reveal a solution (sequence of actions) of solving a given tool use task accidentally. On the other hand, mental imagery was used to replace the outcome of overt movements in the processes of self-determined rewards. Instead of determining a reward from physical interactions, mental imagery allows the robots to evaluate a consequence of actions, in mind, before performing movements to solve a given tool use task. Therefore, collectively, the case of mental imagery in humanoid robots was systematically addressed by means of a number of neurorobotic models and, furthermore, two categories of spatial problem solving tasks: mental rotation and tool use. Mental rotation evidently involves the employment of mental imagery and this thesis confirms the potential for its exploitation by humanoid robots. Additionally, the studies on tool use demonstrate that the key components assumed and included in the experiments on mental rotation, namely affordances and mental imagery, can be acquired by robots through the processes of sensorimotor learning.

We investigated neuropsychological and psychiatric function in AFD patients. We studied 16 AFD patients, aged 7 to 61 years. Intelligence, language, vision-spatial abilities, memory, sensorimotor abilities, and attention and executive functions were tested with a computerized test battery as well as standard paper and pencil tests. The results were compared to known age-based norms. In addition, all patients were screened for lifelong DSM-IV Axis-I and Axis-II psychiatric diagnoses, and 4 were interviewed by a psychiatrist. Performance on most cognitive measures was within average range. All measures of information processing speed were significantly reduced, as were some measures of executive functions. Ten out of 16 patients met DSM-IV criteria for Axis I or Axis II diagnoses at some point in their lives. This preliminary study delineates a psychiatric and cognitive phenotype in AFD patients and contributes to the growing field of characterizing behavioral phenotypes of patients with genetic diseases. We suggest that psychiatric and neuro-psychological evaluation be included in the patient's evaluation. © 2010 SSIEM and Springer.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

We report on the development and validation of a questionnaire of visuoperceptual ability. A 45-item questionnaire was developed on a rational basis to assess self-ratings of visual perceptual and spatial ability. The questionnaire was administered to a sample of 68 neurologically normal adults aged 20-75 years. Reliability (internal and 6 month retest) for the questionnaire was satisfactory. Validity was established by relating questionnaire responses to objective test performance on measures of visual-perceptual functioning and nonvisual perceptual functioning. These findings indicate that it is possible to assess reliably and accurately the self-report ratings of visuoperceptual ability. Similarities and differences of these findings and those reported for self-report measures of memory ability are discussed. © 1989 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.

Mental rotation of the hands can be used as a tool to investigate body schema. Research has shown that implicit motor imagery (i.e., mental simulated movements) can be generated based on the body schema, by combining both stored and incoming sensory information. Multimodal stimulation of peripersonal space has also served as an experimental paradigm for the study of body schema. Perception of peripersonal space is based on body-part-centered space coding that is considered as a manifestation of the body schema, its function being to integrate visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information, and perhaps motor plans as well. By combining such experimental paradigms with neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques, research has converged to show that the parietal association cortex and premotor cortex are important for the body schema. Multimodal perception of body parts and peripersonal space have been also studied in relation to prism adaptation and tool use effects, indicating a clear modifiability of the body schema. Following prolonged adaptation to reversed vision, a reversed hand representation can be added to the body schema like a tool. The stored component of the body schema may not be established well in young children. But once established it may not be deleted even after an arm is amputated, although it may be weakened. All of these findings help to specify properties of the body schema, its components, functions, and modifiabilities. © 2006 Japanese Psychological Association.

The dip seems to suggest their inadequacy in mental operations of spatial representations, as compared with the scaled scores of the other subtests. The present experiment was designed to investigate what kind of mental operations are required to perform the block-design test and to examine in what operations those cerebral palsied children have difficulty. An original and eight modified tasks of the block-design subtest in the WAIS were administered to four such cerebral palsied children. The Eight modified tasks were as follows: visual choice of a model among serevral similar designs (task 2); reproduction of a design from a visual model which was presented in a life-sized demonstration card (task 3); reproduction in which a model was presented in a life-sized demonstration card with divisional lines to clarify the block elements in the design (task 4); reproduction of a design, by employing flat blocks (task 5); painting a copy of a model (task 6); painting a clopy of a model whos elemental divisions were presented one at a time (task 7); reproduction in which a model was constructed of real cubic blocks (task 8); and reproduction of a design after the experimenter demonstrated the same reproduction (task 9). The nine tasks involved six reproduction ones, and the six tasks were presupposed to be arranged orderly from more difficult to easier ones. It was found that the subjects often pass task 2 even when they fail in the original reproduction task, and that the subjects' reproduction improves in task 4 in most cases and somewhat improves in task 8 and task 5. These findings were considered in terms of the subjects'inadequacy in such internal operations as mental sectioning of a representation of a model and mental transformation between two and three dimensional representations. © 1984, The Japanese Association of Educational Psychology.

Royal Society open science	https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.140118	Mental rotation (MR) of body parts is a useful paradigm to investigate how people manipulate mental imagery related to body schema. It has been documented that adult  participants use 'motor imagery' for MR of hands: a behavioural indication is a  biomechanical effect, that is, hand pictures in orientations to which imitative hand  movement would be biomechanically difficult require longer response times to be  visually identified as the left or right hand. However, little is known about the  typical developmental trajectory of the biomechanical effect, which could offer  clues to understanding how children acquire the ability to manipulate body schema.  This study investigated developmental changes in the biomechanical effect in  schoolchildren. Eighty-four children (from 6 to 11 years old, grouped into 1st, 2nd,  3rd, 4th and 5th graders) and fifteen adults made hand laterality judgements in an  MR paradigm. The results indicated that the biomechanical effect is stronger for  younger children, and that there is a transitional period (around 7-8 years) during  which children shift from action execution to imagery in manipulating body schema.  The results suggest that mental imagery of hands has a stronger motor aspect in the  transitional period than later in childhood and adulthood.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A secondary purpose was to evaluate the relation between ADHD symptoms and performance on visual-spatial-motor tasks. Children with ADHD-C and ADHD-PI and controls, all aged 8 to 16 years old, were compared on tests of achievement, fluid reasoning, and visual-motor skills. Children with ADHD-C and ADHD-PI performed significantly poorer on the mathematics calculation, written expression, fluid reasoning, and visual-motor tests compared with the controls. Inattention, but not hyperactivity or impulsivity, was found to significantly predict performance on these measures. The role of inattention on these tasks is important for understanding why children with both subtypes of ADHD experience significant academic problems even when performing in the average range on achievement tests. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Moreover, developmental investigations have only rarely performed a systematic examination of the contribution of perceptual and representational visuo-spatial processes to copying and drawing from memory. In this study we investigated the role of visual perception and mental representation in both copying and drawing from memory skills in a sample of 227 typically developing children (53% females) aged 7-10 years. Participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF). The fit and invariance of the predictive model considering visuo-spatial abilities, working memory, and executive functions were tested by means of hierarchical regressions and path analysis. Results showed that, in a gender invariant way, visual perception abilities and spatial mental representation had a direct effect on copying performance, whereas copying performance was the only specific predictor for drawing from memory. These effects were independent from age and socioeconomic status, and showed that cognitive models of drawing built up for adults could be considered for predicting copying and drawing from memory in children. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	https://doi.org/10.1080/09297049.2019.1651834	Much evidence indicates that drawing is related to different neuropsychological abilities in children. However, a comprehensive cognitive model of drawing in  children is still lacking. Here, we conducted a study on the neuropsychological  predictors of drawing in a sample of 142 typically developing elementary school  children (M age = 8.8 years; SD = 1.1). Based on a path analysis, we examined the  contribution of visual perception (matching geometrical figures), complex spatial  abilities (e.g., complex figures identification and mental rotation), visual  attention, working memory, verbal and visual-motor skills, as well as of gender, age  and socio-economic status, to copying the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF).  Results showed that ROCF copying was influenced in a specific and additive way by  visual perception, visual-motor coordination, and verbal abilities as well as age,  while it was indirectly related to visual attention, working memory, and to complex  spatial abilities. These findings provide the grounds for identifying the  neuropsychological bases of drawing in elementary school children.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry		OBJECTIVE: Multiple sectional studies indicate that the cognitive functions of bipolar disorder (BD) patients in remission are damaged. These studies also suggest  that cognitive functions get worse over time. Although the results are inconsistent,  there are limited follow-up studies that reveal any contradictory results.  Interestingly, there have been major difficulties in the interpretation related to  this subject. In particular, scarcity of longitudinal studies and not eliminating  the role of multidrug side effects on cognitive functions are just a few. Due to  these aforementioned limitations, the longitudinal course of cognitive functions and  their sectional differences were investigated in BD patients that underwent  remission with monotherapy in this study. METHODS: In this study, the cognitive  functions (premorbid IQ, attention, executive functions, memory, visual-spatial  skills, and psychomotor speed) of BD patients (n=27) in remission and on monotherapy  for at least 1 month were assessed at baseline and at an 18 (6-77) month follow-up  period and compared to healthy controls (n=35). RESULTS: The BD group's performance  was worse than those of the control group on tests that evaluated attention,  executive functions including concept formation, mental flexibility, response  inhibition, set shifting, and reasoning, verbal memory, and psychomotor speed. On  the other hand, the BD group showed no significant differences at baseline and  follow-up examinations. CONCLUSION: All cognitive functions of BD patients on  monotherapy remained stable during the follow-up. This suggests that this group  might be a sub-group of BD with good prognosis, and monotherapy may not be harmful  on cognitive functions. On the other hand, it needs longer time to detect cognitive  dysfunctions. Kewords: Bipolar disorder, neurocognition, euthymia, monotherapy,  prospective design.

As expected, girls' academic performance averaged higher than boys'. Path analysis confirmed initial hypotheses that girls' advantage is partially due to their characteristic of greater responsiveness to social cues and compliance with adult direction. This advantage was partially offset in this model by boys' greater visual-spatial skill, which also was a predictor of academic success. Access to stereotypic masculine toys and activities at home was, for both sexes, a predictor of children's visual-spatial ability. As expected, socioeconomic variables, including mothers' occupation and fathers' level of education, also influenced the environmental, social, and cognitive factors predicting academic success. These results indicate that boys' and girls' differential development of specific cognitive and social skills may play an important role in establishing sex differences in academic performance. © 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Children with genetic syndromes often suffer from disfunctions and malformations which obstruct their development and their mental and physical integration. A study was made to establish how their body image is a contributing factor for defining their identity. We focussed our attention on body image in terms of shape level, identity and sex differenciation, detail level and the extent to which the body can be experimented upon within its own boundaries (Witkin, 1962). The Machover 1954 test was used on a group of 28 children : 14 with genetic syndromes with mental age range from 3.6 to 8.5 years; 14 normal ones as control group, with the same chronological and mental age range. The results were then compared. In the 3-4 years range the drawings were composed of sketches and circles, comparing to the control group where we found more detailed drawings. The 4-5 years range group drew primitive figures without facial details and unhumanlike. In the 6-8 years range we can recognise human figures but they still are without facial expressions. In the 8-8.5 years range necks and arms are attached to the shoulders and not to the trunck. In conclusion, taking into account the low level of their visual spatial abilities, these patients drawings generally showed a low articulation and sofistication level of human figure which may mean that they have a low self perception, which could cause an identity disorder.

The present study further evaluated the effects of PA by investigating: (1) the long-term duration of the benefits assessed one week, and one, three and six months after the treatment; (2) the generalisation of the effects to different visual and non-visual functions; and (3) the index of visuo-motor responses (adaptation effect or after-effect) that better predict neglect recovery by PA. To these aims, 21 neglect patients were submitted to PA treatment for 10 daily sessions over a period of two weeks, and their performance was assessed for visual, tactile, proprioceptive, motor and oculomotor functions. The results showed a consistent and stable amelioration of visuo-spatial abilities, both for personal and extrapersonal space. The improvement seems to be partially multimodal, since an amelioration was found for tactile modality, but not for proprioception and motor functions. Finally, neglect amelioration appeared to depend on patients' ability to adapt to prism optical displacement during the fist week of PA, since patients who were not able to correct pointing errors under prism exposure in the first week of treatment showed less neglect and oculomotor system recovery at the end of treatment. © 2007 Psychology Press.

The autistic children were significantly more competent at this task than either group of control children, and also showed qualitatively different strategies. Since the performance of the autistic children was better than predicted from MA and commensurate with CA, it can be regarded as an islet of ability. This finding is discussed in terms of orientation and visualization factors involved in visuo‐spatial abilities and is also related to cognitive deficit. Copyright © 1983, Wiley Blackwell.

To evaluate the clinical effect of left hemisphere OT in a primary progressive aphasia (PPA) patient, 3 year follow-up data were analysed. Methods: Left hemisphere OT was performed on a 68-year-old male with PPA, characterized by moderate dementia and severe expressive aphasia with relatively preserved comprehension, object recognition and visual-spatial abilities. He was longitudinally assessed with cognitive, functional, behavioral and brain HMPAO SPECT measures pre-OT, at baseline and every 3-6 months for 34 months. Results: All measures improved above baseline for >20 months and persisted at or above baseline for 34 months. Cortical activity increased by a maximum of 21% underneath transposed omentum and in synaptically connected areas, and persisted in >50% of the cortex for at least 12 months. Subjectively, family members observed improved verbal and non-verbal communication. Conclusion: OT produced a sustained, beneficial treatment effect in PPA and warrants further clinical and basic research to identify explanatory factors. © 2009 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd.

Molecular genetics and metabolism	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.07.016	AIM: Although hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) arrests the cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis type IH (Hurler syndrome, MPS IH), these children continue  to have neuropsychological deficits as they age. Both compromised attention and  effects on white matter have been observed in cancer patients who have had  chemotherapy. Therefore, we explored the effects of disease and treatment on brain  function in children with MPS I who have had HCT with those with attenuated MPS I  treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). SUBJECTS: 7 MPS IH participants at  least 5 years post-HCT were compared with 7 attenuated participants who were treated  with ERT. MEASURES: IQ, attention, spatial ability, and memory were assessed.  Medical history and an unsedated MRI scan using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were  acquired. RESULTS: Despite clinically equivalent IQ and memory, children with MPS IH  had poorer attention span than those with attenuated MPS I as well as decreased  fractional anisotropy (FA) of the corpus callosum. A relationship between attention  scores and FA was found in the MPS IH group but not the attenuated group. FA was  also related to the frequency of medical events. INTERPRETATION: In children with  MPS IH, both the treatment and the disease affect attention functions associated  with poor white matter integrity.

The study also investigated whether the use of this software impacted males differently than females, or users with high spatial ability differently than those with low. A pretest-posttest control group quasi-experimental design was utilized. The sample group consisted of 116 students, 55 in the experimental group and 61 in the control group. Both groups were given the three measures as pretests and posttests. The investigator worked with the experimental group for 50 minutes a week for 11 weeks. Analysis of covariance determined that there were no significant gains on any measures. No significant differential treatment effects were found with respect to gender or spatial ability levels. However, males significantly outperformed females on the Eliot-Price Test.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The study also investigated if the use of this software impacted males differently than females or impacted users with low spatial ability differently that those with high spatial ability.    The population for the study was fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students. Two groups of each grade level were used. The groups came from a town of 26000 in Wyoming. The sample group consisted of 116 students, 55 students in the experimental group and 61 in the control group.    Students in both groups were given the three measures as both pretests and posttests. The investigator worked with the experimental group for 50 minutes each week for a span of eleven weeks. The experimental group explored the Virtus software by engaging in a set of six activities designed by the researcher. The activities were intended to access the features of the software that conceivably would exercise students' spatial skills. Virtus was originally an architectural tool and allows users to design a room, a setting, or a scene. Students designed three-dimensional structures and placed objects inside the structures they created. By means of an ‘observer’ they could view the scene from specific vantagepoints. Subjects also rotated three-dimensional objects in space, made slices through various polyhedra, and predicted how the resulting cross sections would appear.    Analysis of covariance was used to discern if there were any significant treatment effects. The experimental group did not make significant gains on the Mental Rotations Test and the Eliot-Price Test. There was a significant gain made by the experimental group on the Paper Folding Test (p < .10). No significant differential treatment effects were found with respect to both gender and spatial ability level.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	same study as before?	AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A systematic review revealed a trend for SGA children is increasing cognitive difficulties with increasing age, possibly due to spatial difficulties. A comparison of the cognitive abilities of an RSS group and an age matched control group revealed a cognitive disadvantage in RSS children, particularly spatial difficulties. RSS children were also found to have more behavioural problems than control children, particularly symptoms of ADHD. An investigation revealed an increased incidence of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in RSS than would be expected in the general population, though those with ASD symptoms were not found to form a distinct group of children with RSS. An investigation self esteem in RSS revealed that although they were physically smaller and perceived this, this was not impacting on their overall self esteem. In turn it was revealed that others were not viewing the physical symptoms of RSS as guiding their expectations. Overall the findings from this research were positive and have real life application. It was important that weaknesses, such as was found for spatial ability and hyperactivity and inattention are recognised. What this research was not able to conclude conclusively was why these patterns of behaviour were observed and this offers future directions for the research.

One explanation for this phenomenon is stereotype threat: that females are intimidated by the persistent negative stereotypes about women in STEM fields. Examining the inception and development of stereotype threat among young children is crucial for understanding and bridging the STEM gender gap. Two experiments investigated the effect of stereotype threat on performance on a spatial task among children ages 4 to 10. After a gender identity activation manipulation, children replicated a series of designs with LEGO blocks. In Experiment 1 (N = 22), 4-yearold girls whose gender identity was activated were significantly slower than girls whose gender identity was not activated. In Experiment 2 (N = 160), boys and girls in kindergarten through third grade did not perform differently in stereotypethreat conditions or a condition where gender was not activated. However, girls were consistently slower at the block-construction task than boys. In addition, older children's speed was predicted by their stereotypical attitudes towards LEGO blocks, whether their favorite toy was LEGO blocks, and how frequently they played with blocks at home. Results suggest that gender stereotypes affect children's performance on a gendered activity as early as age 4 and may be continuously affecting older girls' performance. Implications for understanding precursors of the STEM gender gap are discussed. © 2014, Presses universitaires de Grenoble.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

American journal of medical genetics	https://doi.org/10.1002/ajmg.10303	The fragile X syndrome is caused by an unstable CGG repeat sequence in the 5' untranslated region of the X-linked, FMR1 gene. When the number of repeats exceeds  200, the region is hypermethylated and the gene is silenced. The lack of the protein  produced by the FMR1 gene, FMRP, causes the fragile X syndrome. Recent evidence  suggests that FMR1 alleles with unmethylated long repeat tracks (40-200 repeats) may  cause a specific somatic phenotype in women, premature ovarian failure, and may  cause variation in the levels of FMR1 mRNA and FMRP. Because FMR1 is known to be  involved in the regulation of subset of genes expressed in the brain, we  investigated the variation in cognitive and/or behavioral performance among carriers  of high repeat alleles. Specifically, we administered cognitive, behavioral, and  adaptive performance tests to children identified with high repeat alleles who  attended special education classes in Atlanta, Georgia public schools and to those  with < 40 repeats drawn from the same population. Overall, we found no significant  effect of repeat size and the psychometric measures in our test battery after  adjustment for multiple comparisons. All scales were found to be within 1 SD  standard deviation of the mean. We did find an intriguing, albeit marginally  statistically significant, association in the cognitive profile among males and not  females, consistent with an X-linked effect. After adjusting for the overall  cognitive abilities score, Verbal Ability scores decreased and Nonverbal Reasoning  scores increased with repeat number to a greater extent in males than females.  Spatial Ability scores were not associated with repeat number.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Animals were trained in spatial skills in the Morris water maze or were subjected to a soft forced-swimming test 6 months after a 14-day intracerebral administration of BrdU. Significant differences in the amount and composition of the labeled cells in the trained and control rats were found. The relationship between the number of new neural cells and the parameters of the formation of long-term spatial memory was determined. The results indicate that the newly formed neurons with an age of 6 months, as well as the neural cell precursors of the relevant brain structures, are selectively involved in the support of long-term spatial memory. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.1621	Two populations have been found to exhibit delays in theory of mind (ToM): deaf children of hearing parents and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Deaf  children exposed to sign from birth by their deaf parents, however, show no such  delay, suggesting that early language exposure is key to ToM development. Sign  languages also present frequent opportunities with visual perspective-taking (VPT),  leading to the question of whether sign exposure could benefit children with ASD. We  present the first study of children with ASD exposed to sign from birth by their  deaf parents. Seventeen native-signing children with a confirmed ASD diagnosis and a  chronological- and mental age-matched control group of 18 typically developing (TD)  native-signing deaf children were tested on American Sign Language (ASL)  comprehension, two minimally verbal social cognition tasks (ToM and VPT), and one  spatial cognition task (mental rotation). The TD children outperformed the children  with ASD on ASL comprehension (p < 0.0001), ToM (p = 0.02), and VPT (p < 0.01), but  not mental rotation (p = 0.12). Language strongly correlated with ToM (p < 0.01) and  VPT (p < 0.001), but not mental rotation (p = ns). Native exposure to sign is thus  insufficient to overcome the language and social impairments implicated in ASD.  Contrary to the hypothesis that sign could provide a scaffold for ToM skills, we  find that signing children with ASD are unable to access language so as to gain any  potential benefit sign might confer. Our results support a strong link between the  development of social cognition and language, regardless of modality, for TD and ASD  children.

Children and adolescents with C-PTSD have been reported to have deficits in emotional and cognitive functions. We hypothesized that the following are associated with the severity of C-PTSD symptoms: (1) adolescents with C-PTSD who show deficits in emotional perception and cognitive functions, including executive function and attention; and (2) deficits in neurocognitive functions. Methods: Information on 69 adolescents with PTSD, aged 10–19 years, was gathered from seven shelters. All participants were assessed using complete clinical scales, including the C-PTSD Interview and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales, and neurocognitive function tests, including the emotional perception, mental rotation, and modified Tower of London tests. Results: Adolescents with C-PTSD were more likely to have a history of sexual assault, dissociation, and self-harm than those with PTSD. The total and subscale scores of the C-PTSD Interview Scale in adolescents with C-PTSD were higher than that in adolescents with PTSD. In addition, neurocognitive functions, including emotional perception, attention, and working memory, were correlated with the severity of C-PTSD symptoms. Discussion: Adolescents with C-PTSD experienced more serious clinical symptoms and showed more deficits in neurocognitive functions than adolescents with PTSD. Clinicians should pay careful attention toward the emotional and neurocognitive functions when assessing and treating patients with C-PTSD. © Copyright © 2021 Shin, Kim, Hong and Han.

The subjects were 64 second-grade, 65 fourth-grade, and 62 sixth-grade primary-school children, and 44 university students. Four kinds of stimuli, that is, “2”, “5”, “”, “” were used. These stimuli were rotated at an angle of 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240° and 300° and presented to the subjects. They were asked whether the stimulus presented was the same as the non-rotated one. The results showed that there were developmental progresses in the correct responses and the reaction times by grades. Also, the relations between mental rotations and mental abilities showed that the strategies used in this problem were different by grades. Lower grade children were inclined to use spatial abilities while higher grade children were apt to use numerical and verbal abilities. © 1989, The Japanese Association of Educational Psychology.

Recently, considerable attention has focused on the neurobiological underpinnings of sex differences in spatial and verbal abilities. These abilities have been purported to be related to the lateralized functional organization of the cerebral hemispheres. Neurophysiological and neuropsychological studies have suggested that male and female brains are organized differently. Although exposure to sex hormones is believed to play a significant role in these neurocognitive differences between the sexes, it is unclear at what point during human development cognitive sex differences become apparent. Presently, many investigators believe that these performance differences begin to appear following puberty. To date, studies that examine neurophysiological functioning and cognitive performance in preadolescent children have yet to be done.    The purpose of this study was to examine cognitive sex differences in a group of prepubertal children to determine if behavioral and neurophysiological evidence is present to support the hypothesis that cognitive sex-differences are established prior to puberty. Subjects were 40 prepubertal children, twenty girls and twenty boys, between 8 and 12 years of age. Stage of puberty was determined by Tanner Scale rating and hormonal assay, both performed by a pediatric endocrinologist. Each subject was studied using two different procedures: (a) neuropsychological evaluation of spatial and verbal ability, including measure found to be the most sensitive to sex differences; and (b) electrophysiological testing to obtain cortical event-related potentials from left and right hemisphere scalp sites during the performance of three spatial tasks and one verbal task. The stimuli for all of the tasks was presented visually on slides.    The results indicated that (a) sex differences were present for reaction time on a 2 dimensional mental rotation test, with boys showing faster reaction times than girls. (b) there is neurophysiological evidence for functional differences in brain organization between males and females, and (c) that there are differences in patterns of hemispheric asymmetries that are based on the subject's level of spatial ability, regardless of the sex of the subject.

Two projects in this area are presented and their results discussed in the context of theories attempting to account for sex differences in spatial ability in adults. In project one, seventy boys and seventy girls, aged from seven to eleven years, performed a battery of psychometric teats in individual test sessions. The teats had been selected on a two-fold basis. Firstly all had been reported in the literature as showing sex differences in favour of males, and secondly all had been regarded in these studies as measuring spatial ability. In project two, 88 boys and 102 girls, aged 12 to 16 years, performed a similar battery of spatial tests in a group session. In both projects subjects were also given a measure of general intelligence. Results indicated that many of the tests used measured mainly general intelligence. Sex differences, in favour of males, were only shown for children over 14. Girls' scores on the tests used were shown to intercorrelate less highly than boys' scores did. In addition, girls' scores on the spatial tests showed a less consistent increase with age, than boys' scores did. Relevant experience and motivation were shown to be associated with higher spatial scores. Theories attempting to account for sex differences in spatial ability in adults were reviewed in the context of these results and in the context of similar findings in the literature. It was concluded that to a large extent sex differences in spatial ability are social in origin. However the interactional effect of a possible difference in the hemispheric lateralisation of the sexes was not excluded.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

As with IQ tests, investigators have attempted to discriminate factors in the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.    The present study employed a statistical method, dual scaling, to discriminate component skills tapped by the 163 items of the Bayley Mental Scale. Secondly, the study addressed how various components emerge at different points of development. In total, 955 protocols were collected from 286 children, assessed one to five times. There were preterm, full-term and at-risk infants in five groups (approximately 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months). The DUAL3MC (dual scaling for multiple choice data) program was used. Each "solution" represented a domain or skill and identified Bayley items, forming clusters of items. Sixteen domains emerged, which could be grouped in five areas of infant functioning: Visual-Motor/Spatial skills, Cognitive/Performance skills, Language/Communication skills, Social skills and Attention.    As expected, results showed different dominant skills for different ages. At 4 months, for example, the identified domains were (in order of prominence): Environmental and Social Responsiveness, Visual-Motor, Exploration, Sensory-Perceptual (visual), Sensory-Perceptual (auditory), ability to Attend and Execute Commands and Curiosity. In contrast, at 12 months, the skills (in order of prominence) were: Exploration, Manipulation, Problem Solving, Spatial perception, Curiosity, ability to Attend and Execute Commands and Social Interaction.    Results support previously postulated stages of infant development, insofar as the ages when domains or skills become dominant; the pattern observed in the present study is the following (approximate ages, domain): 4 months--Environmental and Social Responsiveness; 8 months--Exploration; 12 months--Exploration; 18 months--Social; 24 months--Language.    The identified infant domain scores showed significant correlations with later test scores (e.g., WISC-R, WRAT, etc.). In 19 profile studies of children ranging from 4 months to 29 months, the identified domains and areas, and their inter-relations are illustrated.    The significance of this study is its empirical identification of domains of infant development through a rigorous statistical procedure. The 16 identified domains thus represent an advance over previous intuitively based groupings. Further, the area of Attention (especially the domain referring to the ability to Attend and Execute Commands), being soundly identified, is a promising basis for future correlational and even predictive analyses of infant development.

The visual spatial skills these children demonstrate are usually remarkable in contrast to their severe impairments in social interaction, abstract reasoning, language, and communication. The goal of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the amount of time children with ASD need to complete an identical 25 piece cutout jigsaw puzzle and a 25 piece computer generated jigsaw puzzle. In the present study, the performance of nine children with ASD was compared among the two visual-spatial tasks. The child’s performance was analyzed according to how quickly they were able to complete both tasks. The findings indicate that children with ASD were able to complete the computer generated jigsaw puzzle task using less time.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

To test this hypothesis, learning disabled and normally achieving children, aged 6 to 14, were administered tasks measuring grammatical, shortterm memory, phonological, reading, and visual-spatial skills. The poor readers were divided into groups of poor readers with 1. inadequate phonics skills, 2. inadequate word recognition skills, 3. adequate word recognition skills but low reading comprehension scores, and 4. adequate word recognition scores but a slow reading speed. These children were compared with children who had normal reading scores. Children with deficits in phonics and/or word recognition scored significantly below normal on all the cognitive tests, except some of the visual-spatial tasks. Reading comprehension difficulties were characterized by average phonics, word recognition, and language skills but below average scores on some memory tasks. Slow readers had cognitive profiles similar to the normal children. The presence of a deficit in phonics and/or word recognition constituted the basis of the most serious impairment of language and memory functioning. Reading disabled children, defined in this manner, appear to be reasonably homogeneous in regard to the presence of language and memory problem. There does not appear to be evidence for a distinctive non-language impaired subtype within this type of reading disability. Children with low comprehension scores and/or slow readers did not have language problems. The definition of a reading disability appears to determine the subtypes and characteristics of reading disability that will emerge. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Indeed, the precise nature of the relationship between gender and wayfinding needs further exploration, especially within real-world outdoor environments. There is a need for more research on this topic, not least to better understand the implications of gender differences in wayfinding for facilitation of our educational programs. This article focuses on this issue by seeking to explore children's map understanding and map use in relation to gender in a large-scale outdoor environment. Ninety-seven children, 3–13 years old, were presented with a pictorial map with 7 controls which they had to locate in any order. Measure of accuracy in wayfinding (number of correctly identified controls) indicate small gender differences. However, measure of efficiency in wayfinding (time spent on the task) indicate that boys outperform girls. © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Patients with Turner's syndrome performed significantly poorer on tests of spatial ability than controls, but only on spatial tests requiring the integration of isolated elements as synthetic wholes or the remembering of spatial configurations which could not be verbally mediated. Patients also performed less well than controls on tasks of serial processing when the tasks could not be mediated verbally.

The ADHD-CT group had (a) decreased activation of the 'action-attentional' system (including Brodmann's areas (BA) 46, 39, 40) and the superior parietal (BA7) and middle frontal (BA10) areas and (b) increased activation of the posterior midline attentional system. These different neuroactivation patterns indicate widespread frontal, striatal and parietal dysfunction in adolescents with ADHD-CT.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The aim of this study was to elucidate the functioning of frontoparietal networks underlying spatial working memory processes during mental rotation in persons with autism spectrum disorders. Method: Seven adolescent males with normal IQ with an autism spectrum disorder and nine age- and IQ-matched male comparison subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans while performing a mental rotation task. Results: The autism spectrum disorders group showed less activation in lateral and medial premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and caudate nucleus. Conclusions: The finding of less activation in prefrontal regions but not in parietal regions supports a model of dysfunction of frontostriatal networks in autism spectrum disorders.

Learn. Conf., CSCL	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102942259&partnerID=40&md5=f00d3ed14f14f4bbe9de21847db6b1f6	If we want to design for computer science learning in K12 education, then Kindergarten is the place to start. Despite differing formats, early childhood coding tools rely heavily on a similar representational infrastructure. Grids and arrows predominate, introducing a nested series of directional symbols and spatial skills children must learn in order to code. Thus, learning to think computationally is entangled with learning to think spatially and symbolically. This paper analyzes video of Kindergarten students learning to use robot coding toys and examines how they navigated programming’s representational infrastructure. We found that children drew on conventional notions of how objects move, creating a “conceptual blend” for programming robot routes (Fauconnier & Turner, 1998). We argue that coding in Kindergarten requires mapping a series of correspondences from the domain of everyday movements onto the resources available in the representational domain. © ISLS	ASK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	Access via https://repository.isls.org/bitstream/1/6843/1/98-105.pdf; specific age not given	5	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

However, the ventral visual stream has not been adequately investigated in this population and so the effect of early TH insufficiency on development of the two streams had not been clearly established. This thesis used a comprehensive set of neuropsychological and experimental tests to assess higher-order visual functions in children and adolescents with CH compared with typically developing individuals. The results show that while CH is associated with poorer performance on tasks tapping into dorsal stream functions such as judgment of line orientation, spatial localization, three-dimensional block and two-dimensional mental construction, judgment of object location, and mental rotation, performance on typical ventral stream tasks such as identity discrimination, including abstract shapes, faces, and buildings, is relatively unimpaired. Thus this thesis establishes that the dorsal visual stream is selectively vulnerable to TH insufficiency.   In addition to the investigating the nature of the higher-order visual problems in CH, this thesis explores the mechanism underlying these problems and assesses whether they result from organizational effects by early TH or activational effects by current TH levels. The data support the organizational mechanism and suggest that prenatal TH insufficiency results in irreversible changes to the dorsal visual stream due to the timing of dorsal stream development, which occurs earlier than ventral stream development and is thus more vulnerable to insult.

Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS	https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617713001136	Individuals with congenital hypothyroidism (CH), even those diagnosed and treated early, experience selective cognitive deficits, the most striking of which involves  the visuocognitive domain. However, the range and nature of their visuocognitive  disturbances is not fully understood. We assessed a range of higher-order  visuocognitive abilities in 19 children and adolescents with CH and 19 age- and  sex-matched typically developing peers (TD) using a battery of neuropsychological  tests and a novel self-report measure of sense of direction. CH scored lower than TD  on direct tests of visuocognitive function (judging line orientation, parts-to-whole  localization, copying three-dimensional block towers, discriminating designs, and  matching unfamiliar faces in ¾ profile-view) as well as on self-reported problems in  spatial ability. Visuocognitive problems were not global as CH and TD did not differ  at copying two-dimensional block designs, mentally rotating and matching abstract  shapes, or at matching unfamiliar front-view faces, design features, or designs that  engaged either figure-ground segregation, visual constancy, or closure. Early and  concurrent thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were associated with  visuocognitive ability, although attention and working memory were not. Individuals  with CH exhibit selective visuocognitive weaknesses, some of which are related to  early and concurrent TSH levels.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Examining the links between number skills and cognitive abilities is important both to improve our theoretical knowledge and to inform practitioners who are assessing and teaching children who have number skills difficulties. One important theoretical debate that can be informed by this work is whether normally developing individuals solve problems involving numbers using distinct cognitive modules that are specialised for such work or whether they utilise more generalpurpose cognitive systems. If weaknesses in particular number skills are associated with particular cognitive deficits, it will support the hypothesis that people utilise their general cognitive architecture. Although research into the interactions between children's cognitive profiles and their responses to different teaching programmes is in the early stages, some studies have suggested that tailoring teaching to a child's cognitive profile can be effective. Therefore identifying groups of children with number skills difficulties that have homogeneous cognitive profiles may help in the design of future intervention strategies. Scope Three main areas of investigation were conducted, all of which examined the links between cognitive abilities and number skills. • An examination of the relationships between three number skills (number fact recall, counting speed and place value understanding) and three cognitive abilities (non-verbal reasoning, auditory-verbal-sequential short-term memory and visual-spatial short-term memory) in normally developing children. • An examination of the cognitive and number skills profiles of children with specific arithmetic abilities (SAD). These children had poor arithmetic attainment, but much better reading attainment. The assessment of these children's cognitive and attainment profiles was comprehensive. The children's verbal, non-verbal and spatial abilities were assessed as well as their psychomotor, visual-spatial memory and auditory-verbal memory abilities. Particular attention was paid to the balance of verbal and spatial abilities in these children as previous research has indicated that children with specific arithmetic difficulties share a homogenous ability profile with poor spatial ability, but better verbal ability. • An examination of the number skills profiles of children and adults with dyslexia. A wealth of previous research has indicated that dyslexic individuals have working memory weaknesses (Hulme, 1981; Shankweiler, Liberman, Mark, Fowler & Fisher, 1979). Three number skills (number fact recall, counting speed and place value understanding) were assessed in dyslexic children, to determine whether a diagnosis of dyslexia was associated with a particular number skills profile. As children with dyslexia had a specific difficulty with number fact recall, the number fact recall of dyslexic adults was compared with non-dyslexic adults, to determine whether this difficulty persisted into adulthood. Structure of the thesis The thesis is divided into nine chapters. Chapter 1 describes the aims of the thesis and gives an outline of its content. Chapter 2 describes and evaluates the two major models of normal adult numerical processing. Chapter 3 describes current knowledge about how children develop number skills; particular emphasis is placed on the interplay between conceptual understanding and procedural skills. Chapter 4 describes and evaluates previous research into the attainment, cognitive and psychosocial strengths and weaknesses of children with arithmetic difficulties. The limitations of the various research methodologies utilised in previous studies are examined. Chapter 5 provides an overview of how dyslexia is defined; current knowledge about the cognitive profiles of dyslexic individuals is also discussed. Research into the number skills of dyslexic children is described and evaluated. Chapter 6 describes and evaluates Study 1, which had three main aims: to produce norms for some new computerised tests of number skills; to examine how place value understanding, counting speed and number fact recall develop injunior age children; to examine the relationships between cognitive and number skills junior aged children. Chapter 7 reports the results of Studies 2 and 3. The aim of Study 2 was to examine the ability profiles of children with specific arithmetic abilities. The results indicated that children with large verbal/spatial ability discrepancies were over-represented in the group with specific arithmetic difficulties. The cognitive profiles of the children with specific arithmetic abilities were examined in Study 3. The children were divided into four groups: low general conceptual ability; non-verbal learning difficulty; low verbal reasoning; and specific memory weakness. An illustrative case study of a child in each group is provided. Chapter 8 describes and evaluates Study 4, in which the counting speed, number fact recall and place value understanding of children with SAD and children with dyslexia was compared to a randomly selected sample of children attending mainstream schools. The children with dyslexia showed weaknesses on the test of number fact recall and one test of counting speed, but they had unimpaired place value understanding. In contrast the children with specific arithmetic difficulties were impaired both on the tests of place value understanding and number fact recall. Chapter 9 describes and evaluates Study 5, in which the number fact recall of a group of dyslexic students was compared to a group of non-dyslexic students who were matched on intellectual ability. The adults with dyslexia were slower and less accurate at recalling number facts. Chapter 10 draws together the results of the five studies. The findings are discussed in reference to models of adult numerical processing and Rourke's non-verbal learning difficulty classification (Rourke & Del Dotto, 1994). A multiple-route model of arithmetic difficulties is proposed and methods that could be used to evaluate the model are described. Recommendations for the diagnostic assessment of children with arithmetic difficulties and for cognitively tailored teaching are made.

Zeitschrift fur Kinderchirurgie : organ der Deutschen, der Schweizerischen und der Osterreichischen Gesellschaft fur Kinderchirurgie = Surgery in infancy and childhood		The ability to find our way about in the environment is taken for granted by older children and adults, the majority of whom find no major difficulties with this task.  It is generally accepted that the ability to mentally "map" our environment is  developmental, conceptual understanding of space being based upon accurate  perceptions. It might therefore be expected that perceptual deficit could affect the  ability to form cognitive maps and lead to way finding difficulties. This paper  investigates the "cognitive mapping" ability of 9 young adults disabled by spina  bifida and hydrocephalus and their able-bodied controls. All Ss were clinically  assessed for nonverbal reasoning ability, spatial ability, left-right orientation  and memory skills. Each person was driven along two routes, route learning being  assessed by (a) directing a driver along the routes (b) marking the routes on sketch  maps and (c) drawing freehand sketch maps of the routes. Results indicated that  although the able-bodied groups performed better on reasoning and spatial tests,  general reasoning ability and mobility experiences were more important than level of  perceptual skill alone for route learning in a real life situation. The importance  of environmental experiences and independence training for mobility during childhood  for those with spina bifida and hydrocephalus is stressed.

Group comparisons indicated no differences in number line estimation. However, the WS group displayed difficulties with visuo-spatial skills and the DS group displayed difficulties with number familiarity. Differential relationships between number line estimation and visuo-spatial/number familiarity skills were observed across groups.

Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2009.07.007	Individuals with 'time-space' synaesthesia have conscious awareness of mappings between time and space (e.g., they may see months arranged in an ellipse, or years  as columns or spirals). These mappings exist in the 3D space around the body or in a  virtual space within the mind's eye. Our study shows that these extra-ordinary  mappings derive from, or give rise to, superior abilities in the two domains linked  by this cross-modal phenomenon (i.e., abilities relating to time, and visualised  space). We tested ten time-space synaesthetes with a battery of temporal and  visual/spatial tests. Our temporal battery (the Edinburgh [Public and  Autobiographical] Events Battery - EEB) assessed both autobiographical and  non-autobiographical memory for events. Our visual/spatial tests assessed the  ability to manipulate real or imagined objects in 3D space (the Three Dimensional  Constructional Praxis test; Visual Object and Space Perception Battery, University  of Southern California Mental Rotation Test) as well as assessing visual memory  recall (Visual Patterns Test - VPT). Synaesthetes' performance was superior to the  control population in every assessment, but was not superior in tasks that do not  draw upon abilities related to their mental calendars. Our paper discusses the  implications of this temporal-spatial advantage as it relates to normal processing,  synaesthetic processing, and to the savant-like condition of hyperthymestic syndrome  (Parker et al., 2006).

Mean full-scale IQ scores are in the range of borderline intellectual function, but academic achievement scores are generally in the low-normal range. A dichotomy is often found between higher Verbal IQ scores and lower Performance IQ, paralleled by relative strength in Reading and Spelling, but weakness in Math. Language skills are also typically delayed and remain impaired later in life, and psychiatric disorders can be found in both children and adults with the syndrome. On-going neurocognitive research suggests that the impairment in mathematical ability may be associated with poor visual-spatial skills. This would be consistent with theoretical models that link arithmetic skills with visual attention and spatially referenced representations of magnitude. Neuroimaging investigations indicate that these skills may all depend critically on the inferior parietal lobes, and lead to our hypothesis that these may be dysfunctional in the 22q11.2 syndrome.

The research, conducted in Papua New Guinea, explored if access to Duplo Lego blocks, across a 7-month period, in early childhood education settings facilitated mathematical learning for children, aged from 5 to 7 years. The research design of the research involved an intervention group (n = 23) with children from three playschools who had access to the blocks across a period of 7 months. A comparison group (n = 26) included children from three elementary schools who had usual programming and resources across the period of the intervention. Learning outcomes were assessed using the Schedule for Early Number Assessment. Findings from this exploratory study indicated that children in the intervention group had stronger mathematics skills at the end of the intervention period than children in the comparison group. Findings indicated that access to block play had potential to improve mathematics skills in early childhood settings in Papua New Guinea. Greater access to block play could provide a feasible and affordable intervention to support early mathematical learning with potential to improve mathematical skills through primary school. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

JAMA	https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.291.20.2448	CONTEXT: Because of methodological limitations, the results of the few prospective studies assessing long-term cognitive effects of prenatal cocaine exposure are  inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of prenatal cocaine exposure and quality  of caregiving environment on 4-year cognitive outcomes. DESIGN: Longitudinal,  prospective, masked comparison cohort study from birth (September 1994-June 1996) to  4 years. SETTING: Research laboratory of a US urban county teaching hospital.  PARTICIPANTS: A total of 415 consecutively enrolled infants identified from a  high-risk population screened for drug use through clinical interview, urine, and  meconium screens. Ninety-three percent retention for surviving participants at 4  years of age resulted in 376 children (190 cocaine-exposed and 186 nonexposed). MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURE: The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-Revised.  RESULTS: After control for covariates, prenatal cocaine exposure was not related to  lower full-scale IQ (cocaine exposed [80.7] vs nonexposed [82.9]; P =.09) scores or  summary verbal (cocaine exposed [79.9] vs nonexposed [81.9]; P =.11) or performance  (cocaine exposed [85.5] vs nonexposed [87.5]; P =.18) IQ scores at age 4 years.  However, prenatal cocaine exposure was related to small but significant deficits on  several subscales (mean [SE]): visual-spatial skills (cocaine exposed [7.3 (0.22)]  vs nonexposed [8.2 (0.22)]; P =.01), general knowledge (cocaine exposed [6.1 (0.18)]  vs nonexposed [6.7 (0.17)]; P =.04), and arithmetic skills (cocaine exposed [6.2  (0.20)] vs nonexposed [6.8 (0.20)]; P =.05). Prenatal cocaine exposure was also  associated with a lower likelihood of achievement of IQ above normative means (odds  ratio, 0.26 [95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.65]; P =.004). The quality of the  caregiving environment was the strongest independent predictor of outcomes.  Cocaine-exposed children placed in nonrelative foster or adoptive care lived in  homes with more stimulating environments and had caregivers with better vocabulary  scores, and they attained full-scale and performance IQ scores (83 and 87,  respectively) similar to nonexposed children in biological maternal or relative care  (full-scale IQ, 82; performance IQ, 88) and higher than cocaine-exposed children in  biological maternal or relative care (full-scale IQ, 79; performance IQ, 84).  CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal cocaine exposure was not associated with lower full-scale,  verbal, or performance IQ scores but was associated with an increased risk for  specific cognitive impairments and lower likelihood of IQ above the normative mean  at 4 years. A better home environment was associated with IQ scores for  cocaine-exposed children that are similar to scores in nonexposed children.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The battery was administered to 98 preschool children. A factor analysis of the intercorrelations of the eight tests revealed four interpretable factors each representing one of the targeted abilities. Prior to this studyevidence for this particular organization of cognitive abilities in young children had not been reported in other factor analytic studies of existing preschool mental tests. An explanation for this fact might be that the earlier test batteries were not designed to measure particular cognitive abilities. On the other handthe eight considered for this study had been designed expressly for that purpose. Based on results of factor analysesa shorter version of the test batteryconsisting of four testswas devised. This shorter version which can be administered in 20 minutesshows promising validity relative to the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. © 1984, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

To examine this view, 90 children aged 6-7 years were administered computer-delivered assessments of verbal ability (verbal concepts) and non-verbal ability (mental rotation), and the scores were compared with measures of verbal and non-verbal ability derived from conventional assessment using the British Abilities Scales (second edition). The results revealed an expected pattern of intercorrelations indicating that the different assessment formats did not significantly affect the ability being assessed. Contrary to some suggestions that computer assessment may favour boys, no gender differences were found in either the conventional or computer assessment formats. Most of the children expressed a preference for the computer format. These findings are evaluated in relation to the various advantages and disadvantages of computer-based assessment in education, and in particular the dangers that because an assessment is computerised, users may overrate its psychometric integrity and hence its value.

This article introduces a neurally constrained computational model of infant habituation. The model combines the two leading process theories of infant habituation into a single functional system that is grounded in functional brain circuitry. The HAB model (for Habituation, Autoassociation, and Brain) proposes that habituation behaviors emerge from the opponent, complementary processes of hippocampal selective inhibition and cortical long-term potentiation. Simulations of a seminal experiment by Fantz [Visual experience in infants: Decreased attention familiar patterns relative to novel ones. Science, 146, 668-670, 1964] are reported. The ability of the model to capture the fine detail of infant data (especially age-related changes in performance) underlines the useful contribution of neurocomputational models to our understanding of behavior in general, and of early cognition in particular.

Educational robotics provide students with the opportunity to collaborate in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) oriented activities. This study aims to examine the effects of robotics training on children’s spatial ability and attitude toward STEM. A one-group pretest–posttest design, a type of pre-experimental design, was used in the study. The participants were 39 elementary school students (34 boys and 5 girls aged 8–12) who participated in a long-term (31 weeks) robotics course. The course had four main learning objectives related to STEM fields: mechanical design, electronics, algorithms, and robotics programming. The spatial visualization and mental rotation tests were used to determine the children’s spatial ability. The STEM attitude scale was used to reveal their attitudes toward science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and related twenty-first century skills. Data were analyzed using t-test and Wilcoxon signed ranks tests. According to the findings, the children’s spatial visualization and mental rotation test scores were significantly increased at the end of the course. Moreover, the children’s attitudes toward STEM were significantly improved. The results showed that educational robotics may improve children’s spatial ability and attitudes toward STEM. The implications of the study were discussed in detail. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The result of long-term active and intensive music training does not affect only musical related skills and also in non-musical related skills i.e., verbal memory, mathematic and spatial ability.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2015.10.016	The current study investigated whether processing of number, space, and time contributes to mathematical abilities beyond previously known domain-general  cognitive abilities in a sample of 8- to 10-year-old children (N=133). Multiple  regression analyses revealed that executive functions and general intelligence  predicted all aspects of mathematics and overall mathematical ability. Working  memory capacity did not contribute significantly to our models, whereas spatial  ability was a strong predictor of achievement. The study replicates earlier research  showing that non-symbolic number processing seems to lose predictive power of  mathematical abilities once the symbolic system is acquired. Novel findings include  the fact that time discrimination ability was tied to calculation ability.  Therefore, a conclusion is that magnitude processing in general contributes to  mathematical achievement.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

T.	1999	journalArticle	Activating effects of cross-sex hormones on cognitive functioning: a study of short-term and long-term hormone effects in transsexuals.	Psychoneuroendocrinology	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0306-4530(98)00091-2	In an earlier study we demonstrated that 3 months of cross-sex hormone treatment clearly influenced cognitive functioning in transsexuals. The aims of the present  study were to examine: (a) whether we could replicate these findings in a new group  of transsexuals; (b) whether a similar pattern of change could be found for novel  tasks, i.e. tasks, not used in the previous study, that measured closely related  cognitive abilities; (c) whether the cognitive changes following cross-sex hormone  treatment had stabilized after 3 months or continued to develop over a period of 1  year; and finally, (d) whether the effects were quickly reversible when the hormone  treatment was temporarily stopped. Again a pronounced effect of androgen treatment  was found on spatial ability in female-to-male transsexuals (FMs) over a period of  one and a half years. As expected, untreated male-to-female transsexuals (MFs) had  higher scores on visuo-spatial tasks than untreated FMs; after 3 months of cross-sex  hormone treatment, the group difference had disappeared, while after about 10 months  of hormone treatment, the sex difference was reversed. These effects did not  disappear after termination of cross-sex hormone therapy for a period of 5 weeks,  but continued to change slightly in the same direction. Earlier findings of an  opposite effect of cross-sex hormones on verbal fluency (i.e. MFs improved and FMs  deteriorated after 3 months of cross-sex hormone treatment) were not replicated in  this study, nor did we find an hormonal influence on other cognitive functions. This  study shows that testosterone had an enhancing, and not quickly reversible effect,  on spatial ability performance, but no deteriorating effect on verbal fluency in  adult women (FMs). In contrast, anti-androgen treatment in combination with estrogen  therapy had no declining effect on spatial ability, nor an enhancing effect on  verbal fluency in adult men (MFs).

Human dermatoglyphics and brain asymmetry have also been ascribed to prenatal hormone levels. This study investigated dermatoglyphics (total ridge count and finger ridge asymmetry) in 184 male-to-female transsexuals and 110 female-to-male transsexuals. In a subgroup, the relationship between dermatoglyphic asymmetry and spatial ability was tested. All investigations included controls. For all subjects hand preference and sexual orientation were noted. We hypothesized that the dermatoglyphics of male-to-female transsexuals would show similarities with control women and those of female-to-male transsexuals with control men. Our results showed a trend for a sex difference in total ridge count (P<.1) between genetic males and females, but no difference in directional asymmetry was found. Contrary to our expectations, the total ridge count and finger ridge asymmetry of transsexuals were similar to their genetic sex controls. Additionally, directional asymmetry was neither related to sexual orientation, nor to different aspects of spatial ability. In conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate that our chosen dermatoglyphic variables, total ridge count and finger ridge asymmetry are related to gender identity and sexual orientation in adult transsexuals. Hence, we found no support for a prenatal hormonal influence on these characteristics, at least insofar as dermatoglyphics may be regarded as a biological marker of organizing hormonal effects.

PloS one	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0200468	How do infants learn to mentally rotate objects, to imagine them rotating through different viewpoints? One possibility is that development of infants' mental  rotation (MR) is facilitated by visual and manual experience with complex objects.  To evaluate this possibility, eighty 4-month-olds (40 females, 40 males)  participated in an object exploration task with Velcro "sticky mittens" that allow  infants too young to grasp objects themselves to nonetheless explore those objects  manually as well as visually. These eighty infants also participated in a visual  habituation task designed to test MR. Half the infants (Mittens First group)  explored the object prior to the MR task, and the other half afterwards (Mittens  Second group), to examine the role of immediate prior object experience on MR  performance. We compared performance of male and female infants, but found little  evidence for sex differences. However, we found an important effect of object  exploration: The infants in the Mittens First group who exhibited the highest levels  of spontaneous object engagement showed the strongest evidence of MR, but there were  no consistent correlations between these measures for infants in the Mittens Second  group. These findings suggest an important contribution from object experience to  development of MR.	ASK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	uploaded	AE	0	0	0	0	0	0	1		7	7	1	NA	7	1	1	1

The evolution of OSA and cognitive performance after stroke is not sufficiently described. Methods We prospectively enrolled and examined acute stroke patients without previously diagnosed OSA. The following information was collected: (1) demographics, (2) sleep cardio-respiratory polygraphy (PG) at 72 h, day seven, month three, and month 12 after stroke, (3) post-stroke functional disability tests at entry and at months three and 12, and (4) cognition (attention and orientation, memory, verbal fluency, language, and visual-spatial abilities) using the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R) at months three and 12. Results Of 68 patients completing the study, OSA was diagnosed in 42 (61.8%) patients. The mean apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) at study entry of 21.0 ± 13.7 spontaneously declined to 11.6 ± 11.2 at month 12 in the OSA group (p < 0.0005). The total ACE-R score was significantly reduced at months three (p = 0.005) and 12 (p = 0.004) in the OSA group. Poorer performance on the subtests of memory at months 3 (p = 0.039) and 12 (p = 0.040) and verbal fluency at months 3 (p < 0.005) and 12 (p < 0.005) were observed in the OSA group compared to non-OSA group. Visual-spatial abilities in both the OSA (p = 0.001) and non-OSA (p = 0.046) groups and the total ACE-R score in the OSA (p = 0.005) and non-OSA (p = 0.002) groups improved. Conclusions A high prevalence of OSA and cognitive decline were present in patients after an acute stroke. Spontaneous improvements in both OSA and cognitive impairment were observed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Nonadditive genetic variance is substantial for one of the six tests, Card Rotations. Whether this nonadditive genetic variance is due to a major autosomal gene is equivocal based on results from segregation and linkage analysis. There is no evidence for genetic variance for Mental Rotations or Hidden Patterns, in contrast to previous findings suggesting major gene involvement (Ashton et al., 1979). If spatial ability is due, in part, to an autosomal major gene, the gene has variable expression (reflected in different tests) or genetic heterogeneity is pronounced. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Educational Studies	https://doi.org/10.1080/0305569960220304	Intra-individual variability of cognitive measures, such as verbal and spatial ability tests, has frequently been reported to typify learning disabled children. To test the generality of such findings, longitudinal data from a large representative and non-clinical sample of Swedish children (n = 812) were analysed. At age 10, the children were tested with a Swedish intelligence scale. At age 13, basic academic skills were measured by standardised achievement tests. Typical cognitive profile types, based on the verbal and spatial intelligence subtests, were identified through cluster analyses (CLUSTAN) of the girl and boy samples separately. The satisfactory solution arrived at was a five-cluster representation for the girls (n = 497) and an eight-cluster representation for the boys (n = 497). For both sexes, verbally as well as spatially oriented profiles emerged. However, the verbal orientation was more pronounced for girls, whereas the boys displayed greater variability and stronger spatial orientation. General intelligence at age 10 was a strong predictor for basic skills at age 13 (r > 0.70). Verbally strong children tended to achieve better than predicted by their overall level of intelligence, whereas spatially oriented children showed a less favourable development in basic academic skills. The results are discussed in relation to neuropsychologically-based models of reading disability and theories of language and development.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Multiple neuropsychological domains, including executive functions, attention, language, visual-spatial processing, memory, and sensorimotor functioning, were examined. Archival school neuropsychological evaluation reports were reviewed resulting in 100 participants aged five to 12.9 ( M = 9.90) with 72 males and 28 females. The participants' significant medical, psychological, and neuropsychological histories resulted in a mixed clinical sample. The two most commonly reported diagnoses were Learning Disability (n = 19) and Emotional Disturbance with ADHD (n = 19). Measures included the NEPSY to evaluate neurocognitive skills and parent and teacher rated BASC-2 scores as measures of behavior.    Due to missing information within the archival evaluations, multiple imputation was used to approximate the missing data. Multiple linear regression-stepwise analyses were performed to predict BASC-2 scores from NEPSY scores. Results indicate that NEPSY scores do predict BASC-2 scores. In regards to externalizing behaviors, although the overall model is significant, the results do not indicate that children who exhibit higher ratings of externalizing problems also exhibit weaknesses in the neuropsychological areas of executive functions, attention, and memory.    In regards to internalizing behaviors, children who exhibit higher levels of internalizing problems did not exhibit weaknesses in the neuropsychological areas of memory, attention, language, and sensorimotor functioning. The results indicate that some tests of attention and visual-spatial skills predicted behavior for males. Tests of attention, executive functioning, memory, visual-spatial, and sensorimotor skills predicted behavior scores in females. Finally, the hypothesis that neuropsychological predictors of behavior will differ depending on parent or teacher rated behavior was supported. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, the obtained results raise additional questions and further research is indicated for a better understanding of the nature and generalizability of these findings.

Despite considerable effort across many disciplines and many specific advances, there is no comprehensive or well-accepted account of this ability. Moreover, none of the extant approaches consider how human object recognition develops. New evidence indicates a period of rapid change in toddlers' visual object recognition between 18 and 24 months that is related to the learning of object names and to goal-directed action. Children appear to shift from recognition based on piecemeal fragments to recognition based on geometric representations of three-dimensional shape. These findings may lead to a more unified understanding of the processes that make human object recognition as impressive as it is.	ASK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		5	2	0	2	2	0	0	1

Participants included 20 children aged 6–12. This research was guided by Vossoughi, Hooper, and Escudé’s (2016) call for explicit attention to pedagogical practices during the integration of “making” activities. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data, including observation, researcher/facilitator field notes, think aloud protocols, daily reflective exit tickets, and participant artifacts. Findings highlight the ways in which participants negotiated visualization skills through (a) imagining, drawing, and seeing through creating 2-D sketches, (b) reasoning and relating through writing stories, (c) transforming through 3-D extrusion, (d) observing and noticing through 3-D sculpting and 3-D scanning, and (e) manipulating through digital 3-D modeling, mental rotation, and mental transformation.

This paper demonstrates how these dynamic properties may be used to provide a means of assessing a patient's visuo-spatial ability - an important component of neuropsychological testing. The work described here provides a quantitative assessment of visuo-spatial ability, whilst preserving the conventional test environment. Results will be presented for a clinical population of long-term haemodialysis patients and test population comprises three groups of children (i) 7-8 years, (ii) 9-10 years and (iii) 11-12 years, all of which have no known neurological dysfunction. Ten new dynamic measurements extracted from patient responses in conjunction with one static feature deduced from earlier work describe a patient's visuo-spatial ability in a quantitative manner with sensitivity not previously attainable. The dynamic feature measurements in isolation provide a unique means of tracking a patient's approach to motor activities and could prove useful in monitoring a child's visuo-motor development.

Specifically, visuo-spatial ability is assessed by analysing subjects' digitised responses to a simple figure copying task using a conventional test environment. The algorithm was trained to distinguish between classes of visuo-spatial ability based on responses to the figure copying test by 7-11 year old children in which visuo-spatial ability is at varying stages of maturity. Results from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis are presented for the training and subsequent testing of the algorithm and demonstrate this technique has the potential to form the basis of an objective assessment of visuo-spatial ability. © 2009 IEEE.

This research combines these approaches. Mental rotation (the ability to mentally rotate objects) was examined by focusing on the developmentalists' concern for age of acquisition of this ability and the information theorists' attention to stimulus factors influencing this competency.    Sixty students, twenty each in kindergarten, third, and fifth grade, participated in the study; there were equal numbers of males and females for every grade. Each student was shown 240 slides featuring two line drawings, a standard stimulus on the left, a trial stimulus on the right. For each slide, the subject indicated whether the stimuli were alike or different by pressing an appropriate button. The standard stimulus was always upright; the trial stimulus was upright or was rotated to 45, 90, 135, or 180 degrees.    The four standard stimuli used each consisted of a circle. They differed, however, by possessing or lacking a cone atop the circle and by having an orthogonal or oblique internal axis. Each standard stimulus was paired with a trial stimulus which was a:  (1) match, (2) reflection, or (3) internal mismatch (orthogonal axis paired with an oblique axis and vice-versa) of the standard stimulus.    When the subjects indicated their judgment, their choice and their response time were recorded, providing both competency and process data. A series of analyses were performed, the outcome of one directing the course of the next. Two analyses of variance were made on competency data (for zero and for the rotated positions) and one on process data.    The research yielded several significant findings, the most important of which was an interaction between the nature of the to-be-rotated stimulus and the degree of the rotation. This interaction indicated that short reaction times occurred when the internal axis of the test item was orthogonal; long reaction times occurred when the axis was oblique. These results were discussed with regard to developmental and information processing views of mental rotation.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	kindergarterners are 6 yo on avg	3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Human movement science	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humov.2008.03.005	In the present study a new test is proposed and tested, which requires ability to use information both from kinesthesia and from mental rotation of previously  produced cyclic movements over a distinct trajectory. This Line Copy Test (LICT) was  performed by 58 children aged 7-11 years. For the S-part, the participants first had  to make movements till they reached a barrier and then they were required to  reproduce the same (S) movements without the barrier. For the O-part of the test the  participants had to rely on an internal representation of a felt trajectory length,  and reproduce the movement orthogonal (O) to the ones felt. Trajectory Length Error  (TLE) and variable error (VE) were measured. Furthermore, results of the LICT were  correlated to the Kinesthetic Acuity Test and a pegboard task. The general finding  was that the TLE, capturing the spatial calibration of the movement, and the VE,  used as a measure of noise or inconsistency in the 10 reproductions, was largest for  the youngest children, but this developmental effect was not significant in the  O-part of the test. Although participants of all age groups made much larger TLE in  the rotated task (O-part) than in the LICT_S-part, the VE was much smaller. This can  be explained by assuming that different underlying control mechanisms underlie each  task. Also differences in correlations of the two parts of the test with the other  measures infer that they measure dissimilar underlying entities. It is likely that  at least some portion of the increased movement variability in the S-part seen  during development in young children can be attributed to partly unstable  kinesthetic representations for hand movements. The finding that no significant  development was found on the O-part indicates that changes in the use of internal  models must occur outside the age window studied.

This study aimed to characterize age and sex differences in human spatial ability using a virtual Water Maze Task (vWMT), which is based on the classic Morris water maze spatial navigation task used in rodents. Performance on the vWMT and on a task assessing visuospatial perception, Mental Rotations Test (MRT), was examined in 33 adolescents and 39 emerging adults. For the vWMT, significant effects of age and sex were observed for path length in the target region (narrower spatial sampling), and heading error, with emerging adults performing better than adolescents, and an overall male advantage. For the MRT, males scored higher than females, but only in emerging adulthood. Overall, sex differences in visuospatial perception (MRT) emerge differently from those observed on a classic navigation task, with age and sex-specific superior vWMT performance likely related to the use of more efficient strategies. Importantly, these results extend the developmental timeline of spatial ability characterization to include adolescent males and females performing a virtual version of the classic vWMT. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The measure utilized was developed by Thurstone and involves mental rotation of letters/words, objects, and figures. The first study investigated the construct validity of the mental rotation task. The results indicated that the test assessed a distinct construct, which focused on visual integrative functions. The second study examined differences on the mental rotation test between academically average and academically dysfunctional children. The results yielded significant differences on the overall measure. The third study investigated differences among normal, attention deficit disorder, and neurological dysfunction children.

No sex differences were found but there was an effect for age with the  older children performing significantly higher. The results of  regressional analyses indicated that the for the entire sample, there  was considerable shared variance between mental rotation and a visual  discrimination task. Separate analyses for boys and girls yielded  similar results but there were differences when age levels were  analyzed. For the younger children (6‐to 8‐years old), there was a  strong relationship between mental rotation and visual discrimination,  whereas for the older children (9‐ to 11‐year olds) the primary source  of shared variance was with motor speed. The results are discussed in  terms of developmental models of neuropsychological functioning. 	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR	https://doi.org/10.1044/2015_JSLHR-L-14-0213	PURPOSE: The current study examined whether children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in comparison with typically developing children, perceive and produce  gestures to identify nonpresent objects (i.e., referent-identifying gestures), which  is crucial for communicating ideas in a discourse. METHOD: An experimenter described  the uses of daily-life objects to 6- to 12-year-old children both orally and with  gestures. The children were then asked to describe how they performed daily  activities using those objects. RESULTS: All children gestured. A gesture identified  a nonpresent referent if it was produced in the same location that had previously  been established by the experimenter. Children with ASD gestured at the specific  locations less often than typically developing children. Verbal and spatial memory  were positively correlated with the ability to produce referent-identifying gestures  for all children. However, the positive correlation between Raven's Children  Progressive Matrices score and the production of referent-identifying gestures was  found only in children with ASD. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ASD might be less able  to perceive and produce referent-identifying gestures and may rely more heavily on  visual-spatial skills in producing referent-identifying gestures. The results have  clinical implications for designing an intervention program to enhance the ability  of children with ASD to communicate about nonpresent objects with gestures.

Nine hearing children of deaf parents were studied and the cerebral activation was  measured by recordings of the regional cerebral blood flow. Comprehension of a  complex material gave a bilateral activation of posterior temporal regions for both  spoken and signed language. It seems that sign language activates the cortex in a  way which is very similar to spoken language, when the listener watches the speaker.  Cortical areas usually regarded to be important for spatial ability do not show  enhanced activation during sign language perception.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of the American Optometric Association		The relative influences of visual-spatial and verbal factors on the performance of written and mental arithmetic by normally achieving fourth and fifth grade children  are compared. The independent perceptual and verbal measures were correlated with  the Arithmetic Subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) and the Arithmetic  Subtest of the WISC-R using both bivariate and multivariate analysis. In the  performance of the written arithmetic, spatial factors yield a statistically  significant higher positive correlation than verbal skills. On the other hand,  verbal skills appear to render a higher positive, but not statistically significant,  correlation with mental arithmetic than spatial skills. Optometrists should be aware  of the potential for treatment of visual and perceptual dysfunctions present in  children who are experiencing problems in written and mental arithmetic.

A vast majority of the studies on this topic have focused on adults, and few on in children. In this study, eight tasks were selected to assess eight factors of spatial ability and were modified to be suitable for children. Computerized versions of the tasks were designed and their reliability was measured. One-hundred and ten Iranian children aged 9 to 12 years old participated in the study. In order to assess the test-retest reliability, half of the participants were tested twice. Internal consistency reliability was calculated for some of the tasks. Intraclass correlation coefficients were obtained by test-retest reliability analysis for all tasks ranging from 0.689 to 0.997. The range of Cronbach's α coefficient was found to be between 0.335 and 0.784. The range of the ω coefficient was from 0.428 to 0.798. Each modified task had adequate reliability for assessing the respective spatial ability factors. This battery can help to identify the level of spatial performance in children. © 2021 University of Finance and Management in Warsaw. All rights reserved.

Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.01.003	Hand preference - which is related to cerebral dominance - is thought to be associated with cognitive skills; however, findings on this association are  inconsistent and there is no consensus whether left- or right-handers have an  advantage in either spatial or verbal abilities. In addition, it is not clear  whether an interaction between sex and hand preference exists in relation to these  cognitive abilities. As these matters are relevant from a neurodevelopmental  perspective we performed a meta-analysis of the available literature. We searched  PubMed and Embase, and included 14 studies (359,890 subjects) in the verbal ability  meta-analysis and 16 studies (218,351 subjects) in the spatial ability  meta-analysis. There was no difference between the full sample of left and  right-handers for verbal ability, nor was there a hand preference-by-sex  interaction. Subgroup analysis of children showed a small right-hand benefit. Our  results further revealed a modest but significant effect favouring right-handedness  for overall spatial ability, which was more pronounced when analysis was restricted  to studies applying the mental rotation test. We could not identify a specific  interaction with sex. Our results indicate that there is a small but significant  cognitive advantage of right-handedness on spatial ability. In the verbal domain,  this advantage is only significant in children. An interaction effect with sex is  not confirmed.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

This application was developed with the concept of Logo-MicroWorlds, which allows children to examine and simulate their geometric ideas in a virtual world with a turtle agent. TurtleGO provides children with real-time feedback in a monitor representing the augmented turtle image on blocks based on AR technology while children are playing with actual blocks. Our application is flexible and inexpensive as it makes possible the use of various sized cubes already in possession. All the children between grades 2 through 5 improved in their ability to distinguish pair of stimuli as identical or mirror images when they used TurtleGO. However, we found that our application provides an effective and intuitive AR learning environment to lower grade elementary students, improving their spatial transformation skills since upper graders could solve the tasks easily without it. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

This study examined, in a sample of 66 mother–infant dyads, 2 early contextual precursors of later mathematical development at preschool age and at the end of comprehensive school. The path analyses showed that maternal autonomy support and scaffolding observed during joint play interactions in infancy, and time spent in various care contexts beyond infancy contributed more to variation in numerical skills than spatial skills tested at preschool age. Maternal autonomy supportive behaviours were related to differences in mathematics and other school grades collected in ninth grade, even after controlling for time spent in various care contexts. Moreover, joint play interactions mediated the relation between mothers' education and children's mathematical outcomes. The findings are discussed in relation to why early developmental contexts can provide an advantageous base for children's mathematical achievement in a society with a high-quality education system. Highlights: Does the quality of mother–infant interaction and amount of early childhood education and care beyond infancy predict children's mathematical development? Mothers' cognitive guidance observed during play predicted children's mathematics skills tested at preschool and assessed by teachers at 9th grade. Autonomy support and scaffolding in early developmental contexts can have far-reaching influences on children's motivation and school achievement. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The British journal of educational psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12217	BACKGROUND: Only a handful of longitudinal studies have explored the effects of both parents in early parenthood on children's cognitive development, and no study has  controlled for simultaneous early childhood education and care (ECEC) experiences.  AIMS: To examine the similarity of each parent's cognitive guidance and contribution  to children's pre-mathematical outcomes across parent gender while controlling for  amount of ECEC. SAMPLE: A longitudinal study on 66 Finnish two-parent families and  their children. METHODS: Both parents' autonomy support and scaffolding behaviour  were observed during play interactions with the child at 2;0. Children's numerical  and spatial skills were tested at 3;0 and 4;0. Parental reports on amount of ECEC in  months were collected at 2;0, 3;0, and 4;0. RESULTS: The two parenting constructs  were conceptually similar across parent gender as demonstrated by fairly strong  measurement equivalence. While mothers on average showed more scaffolding and equal  amounts of autonomy support compared to fathers during play interaction, they  displayed less variability in the former and more variability in the latter  behaviour. The contribution of mothers' and fathers' cognitive guidance was more  similar for children's numerical than spatial development. Both parents' education  positively predicted autonomy support but not amount of ECEC exposure, which was  positively related to numerical development. As expected, parents' education did not  predict ECEC exposure, and child gender was not related to child outcomes.  CONCLUSIONS: The findings are discussed in relation to measurement invariance and  gender-neutral parenting in the context of early childhood.

Mathematics Education Research Journal	https://doi.org/10.1007/s13394-020-00328-9	The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) testing is conducted every 3 years by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; oecd.org) with 15-year-olds across the globe. Students complete a battery of tests in science, reading, and mathematics and complete an attitudinal survey. The goal of the PISA testing is to determine, broadly, if children are prepared for successful adulthoods. This means that items on the test are application- and not theoretically based. The mathematics portion of the PISA test includes problems in four content subtest areas: (1) change and relationships, (2) quantity, (3) uncertainty and data, and (4) space and shape. The subscale most closely related to spatial cognition is space and shape. Developers of the mathematics portion of the test indicate that student scores on subset areas 1 through 3 also depend on a child’s understanding of space and shape; thus, the space and shape construct is a key to overall performance on the test. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, it examines PISA data by subtest for several countries by analyzing trends between high-performing countries and other countries of interest with a particular focus on the subtest scores for space and shape. Second, the paper examines the relationship between scores on individual released items from PISA and scores on standard instruments designed to assess spatial skills for students from the USA. Findings indicate that success on PISA items is significantly correlated with scores on tests of spatial cognition. This finding means that improving spatial skills could be an overlooked strategy to improve student performance on large-scale tests of student achievement and has the potential to ultimately better prepare children for successful adulthoods. © 2020, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.

Unfortunately, numerous studies have shown significant gender differences in spatial skills. Research conducted at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) among engineering technology students showed that their spatial skills lag significantly behind those of engineering students at predominantly white institutions. However, these differences could be due to differences in backgrounds and abilities between engineering and engineering technology students, and not due primarily to racial differences. As we strive to diversify engineering education, it will be important to understand how differences in spatial skills could contribute to underrepresentation in engineering. In this paper, we will use data gathered over a sixteen-year period at a predominantly white institution among first-year engineering students to examine differences in spatial skills among majority, minority, and international students. Data will be disaggregated by gender where feasible. We will also examine data from a background questionnaire to determine if there are racial or cultural differences in participation in those activities thought to develop 3-D spatial skills, including playing 3-D computer games, participation in pre-college drafting or shop courses, or play with construction toys as a child. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.

Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition	https://doi.org/10.1097/MPG.0000000000000575	OBJECTIVES: Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a rare but serious event, with poorly understood functional outcomes. The goal was to determine the prevalence of  reduced neuropsychological functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQOL)  following PALF. METHODS: This multicenter study examined neuropsychological  functioning and HRQOL 1 to 6 (median 3.8) years after PALF. Participants ages 6 to  16 (median 9.9) years were recruited from the PALF registry and administered  measures of intelligence, visual spatial/visual motor coordination, attention,  executive function, depression, and adaptive skills. HRQOL and fatigue were assessed  using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales (PedsQL 4.0)  and PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients  participated; 50% were boys and 67% were white. Median age at PALF was 5.6 years. A  history of grade 3 or 4 hepatic encephalopathy was reported in 5/36 (14%)  participants and 23/36 (64%) received a liver transplant. Visual spatial ability was  significantly better than norms (P = 0.009), but motor coordination was worse  (P = 0.04). Teachers (P = 0.04 to P < 0.0001) and parents (P = 0.005) reported more  executive deficits versus norms, and participants had worse attention (P = 0.02).  Participants did not differ significantly from norms on IQ, depression, or adaptive  functioning. All of the child self-report PedsQL Generic Core and fatigue scales  were significantly lower than a matched healthy sample (P = 0.001 to P < 0.0001) and  parent proxy report was lower on the fatigue scales (P = 0.001 to P < 0.0001).  CONCLUSIONS: Long-term PALF survivors demonstrate average IQ and visual spatial  ability, but greater than expected impairments in motor skills, attention, executive  function, HRQOL, and fatigue.

Developmental Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1037/a0014618	How do infants learn to perceive the backs of objects that they see only from a limited viewpoint? Infants’ 3-dimensional object completion abilities emerge in conjunction with developing motor skills—independent sitting and visual–manual exploration. Infants at 4.5 to 7.5 months of age (n = 28) were habituated to a limited-view object and tested with volumetrically complete and incomplete (hollow) versions of the same object. Parents reported infants’ sitting experience, and infants’ visual–manual exploration of objects was observed in a structured play session. Infants’ self-sitting experience and visual–manual exploratory skills predicted looking at the novel, incomplete object on the habituation task. Further analyses revealed that self-sitting facilitated infants’ visual inspection of objects while they manipulated them. The results are framed within a developmental systems approach, wherein infants’ sitting skill, multimodal object exploration, and object knowledge are linked in developmental time.

Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00127.x	Three-dimensional (3D) object completion, the ability to perceive the backs of objects seen from a single viewpoint, emerges at around 6 months of age. Yet, only  relatively simple 3D objects have been used in assessing its development. The  present study examined infants' 3D object completion when presented with more  complex stimuli. Infants (N = 48) were habituated to an "L"-shaped object shown from  a limited viewpoint; then they were tested with volumetrically complete (solid) and  incomplete (hollow) versions of the object. Four-month-olds and 6-month-old girls  had no preference for either display. Six-month-old boys and both sexes at 9.5  months of age showed a novelty preference for the incomplete object. A control group  (N = 48), only shown the test displays, had no spontaneous preference. Perceptual  completion of complex 3D objects requires infants to integrate multiple, local  object features and thus may tax their nascent attentional skills. Infants might use  mental rotation to supplement performance, giving an advantage to young boys.  Examining the development of perceptual completion of more complex 3D objects  reveals distinct mechanisms for the acquisition and refinement of 3D object  completion in infancy.

Phonological  awareness, visual-spatial STM, and nonsymbolic approximate discrimination predicted  growth in early calculation skills.These results suggest that both the approximate  number system and domain-general phonological and visual-spatial skills support  early calculation. In contrast, only performance on a small nonsymbolic quantity  discrimination task (where the presented quantities were always within the  subitizing range) predicted growth in cardinal counting skills. These results  suggest that the development of counting and the development of calculation are  supported by different cognitive abilities.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in pediatrics	https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.00100	Although motor imagery has been pointed as a promising strategy for the rehabilitation of children with neurological disorders, information on their  development throughout childhood and adolescence is still scarce. For instance, it  is still unclear at what age they reach a development comparable to the motor  imagery performance observed in adults. Herein we used a mental rotation task to  assess motor imagery in 164 typically developing children and adolescents, which  were divided into four age groups (6-7, 8-9, 10-11, and 12-13 years) and 30 adults.  The effects of biomechanical constraints, accuracy, and reaction time of the mental  rotation task were considered. ANOVA showed that all groups had the effect of  biomechanical restrictions of the mental rotation task. We found a group effect for  accuracy [F ((4, 180)) = 17,560; p < 0.00; η(2) = 3.79] and reaction time [F ((4,  180)) = 17.5; p < 0.001, η(2) = 0.615], with the results of children groups 6-7 and  8-9 years being significantly lower than the other groups (p < 0.05). In all the  analyses, there were no differences regarding accuracy and reaction time among the  participants of the age groups 10-11 and 12-13 years and adults (p > 0.05).  Concluding, children aged 6-7 years were able to perform motor imagery, motor  imagery ability improved as the participants' ages increased, and children aged 10  and over-performed similarly to adults.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00787	Over the last two decades, the number of studies on motor imagery in children has witnessed a large expansion. Most studies used the hand laterality judgment paradigm  or the mental chronometry paradigm to examine motor imagery ability. The main  objective of the current review is to collate these studies to provide a more  comprehensive insight in children's motor imagery development and its age of onset.  Motor imagery is a form of motor cognition and aligns with forward (or predictive)  models of motor control. Studying age-related differences in motor imagery ability  in children therefore provides insight in underlying processes of motor development  during childhood. Another motivation for studying age-related differences in motor  imagery is that in order to effectively apply motor imagery training in children  (with motor impairments), it is pertinent to first establish the age at which  children are actually able to perform motor imagery. Overall, performance in the  imagery tasks develops between 5 and 12 years of age. The age of motor imagery  onset, however, remains equivocal, as some studies indicate that children of 5 to 7  years old can already enlist motor imagery in an implicit motor imagery task,  whereas other studies using explicit instructions revealed that children do not use  motor imagery before the age of 10. From the findings of the current study, we can  conclude that motor imagery training is potentially a feasible method for pediatric  rehabilitation in children from 5 years on. We suggest that younger children are  most likely to benefit from motor imagery training that is presented in an implicit  way.

Method: A geographical cohort of 70 children with CP was assessed with tests of language comprehension, visual-spatial reasoning, attention, working memory, memory, and executive functioning. Mean age was 9;9 years (range 5;1–17;7), 54.3% were girls, and 50.0% had hemiplegic, 25.7% diplegic, 12.9% quadriplegic, and 11.4% dyskinetic CP. For the participants with severe motor impairments, assessments were adapted for gaze pointing. A cognitive quotient (CQ) was computed. Results: Mean CQ was 78.5 (range 19–123). Gross motor functioning, epilepsy, and type of brain injury explained 35.5% of the variance in CQ (F = 10.643, p =.000). Conclusion: Twenty-four percent had an intellectual disability, most of them were children with quadriplegic CP. Verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning scores did only differ for the 21% with an uneven profile, of whom two-thirds had challenges with perceptual reasoning. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

Ciba Foundation symposium	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027793714&partnerID=40&md5=c67b1dbc3367d9548d5067b8db1fa6e4	Since 1971 the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) at Johns Hopkins University has pioneered in discovery of and provision of educational help for 12-year-old boys and girls who reason better mathematically than 99% of other 12-year-olds. SMPY originated widespread searches for such youths and special academic classes for them outside the regular school system. A regional talent search, verbal as well as mathematical, now covers all 50 states of the USA, and many varied residential summer programmes are offered across the country. These have provided educational facilitation for many thousands, and have encouraged greater curricular flexibility in schools and better articulation of in-school with out-of-school learning experiences. From the first talent search conducted by SMPY in 1972, it became obvious that boys tend to score considerably higher than girls on the College Board Scholastic Aptitude Test-Mathematical (SAT-M), a test intended mainly for college-bound 17- and 18-year-olds. This difference was reported in 1974 but attracted little attention until a controversial report in 1980 stimulated research on sex differences in various aspects of mathematics. Here I describe a study of sex differences over 10 years on 14 College Board high school achievement tests, which are taken (three usually) by bright 17- and 18-year-olds seeking admission to the USA's selective colleges and universities. Among the high scores on the European history test the ratio of males to females was greatest, 6:1. The next most sex-differentiating test was physics, 2.9:1, followed by elementary-level mathematics (mainly algebra and geometry), 2.5:1. Other ratios favouring males were, in 1991, chemistry (2.4:1), American history (2.1:1), biology (1.8:1), precalculus mathematics (1.6:1), Latin (1.6:1), French (1.4:1), modern Hebrew (1.1:1) and German (1.02:1). Tests in which more females were high scorers were literature (1.26:1), English composition (1.05:1) and Spanish (1.01:1). The largest sex differences on other standardized tests, for mechanical reasoning and spatial rotation, favour males. There are even larger differences for self-reported evaluative attitudes, with the theoretical value high for boys and the aesthetic high for girls. Such value scores correlated strangely with scores on achievement and aptitude tests. By 12 or younger, bright boys and girls already show many of the cognitive sex differences found in 18-year-olds.

Studies in health technology and informatics		In this chapter we review some of the ways in which the skills learned in virtual environments (VEs) transfer to real situations, and in particular how information  about the spatial layouts of virtual buildings acquired from the exploration of  three-dimensional computer-simulations transfers to their real equivalents. Four  experiments are briefly described which examined VR use by disabled children. We  conclude that spatial information of the kind required for navigation transfers  effectively from virtual to real situations. Spatial skills in disabled children  showed progressive improvement with repeated exploration of virtual environments.  The results are discussed in relation to the potential future benefits of VR in  special needs education and training.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Chapter 1 reviews the literature on spatial mapping. Chapter 2 introduces the background to virtual environments, and reviews the relevant experimental work in this field. Chapter 3 developed a novel paradigm for investigating configural learning in humans, based on a shortcut study previously used with hamsters. In experiments 1-3 optimal cue arrangement was investigated. Results indicated that four large cues, rather than small or continuous cues, were required in order to complete the shortcut task successfully. Experiment 4 demonstrated the paradigm to be a successful replication of the original task and a good measure of spatial ability. Experiment 5 compared the shortcut behaviour of physically disabled children with varying degrees of mobility. Children who had had limited mobility from birth were poorer at the task than those whose mobility had deteriorated with age, supporting the hypothesis that early independent exploration is important in the development of cognitive spatial mapping ability. In Chapter 4 (experiment 6) physically disabled children explored a simulation of a school and then completed tests of spatial ability within the equivalent real school. A successful transfer of spatial skills was demonstrated and thus the potential of this technology for training. In Chapter 5, experiments 7-9 examined the effect of repeated exposure to virtual environments. Experiment 7 confirmed that the skills disabled children acquired using virtual environments improved with exposure to successive environments. To eliminate the possibility that learning was influenced by non-specific factors, experiment 8 compared 3-D exploration and 2-D (control) exploration, finding spatial learning in the former to be superior. Experiment 9 confirmed the extent of improvement in spatial skills following intensive 3-D exploration. Chapter 6 draws conclusions from the experiments and suggests ideas for further research.

Journal of neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/jnp.12093	The aim of this study was to specify whether cerebellar lesions cause visuospatial impairments in children. The study sample consisted of 40 children with low-grade  cerebellar astrocytoma, who underwent surgical treatment and 40 healthy controls  matched with regard to age and sex. Visuospatial abilities were tested using the  spatial WISC-R subtests (Block Design and Object Assembly), Rey-Osterrieth Complex  Figure, Benton Judgment of Line Orientation Test, PEBL Mental Rotation Task, and  Benton Visual Retention Test. To exclude general diffuse intellectual dysfunction,  the WISC-R Verbal Intelligence IQ, Performance IQ, and Full-Scale IQ scores were  analysed. Post-surgical medical consequences were measured with the International  Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale. Compared to controls, the cerebellar group  manifested problems with mental rotation of objects, visuospatial organization,  planning, and spatial construction processes which could not be explained by medical  complications or general intellectual retardation. The intensity of visuospatial  syndrome highly depends on cerebellar lesion side. Patients with left-sided  cerebellar lesions display more severe spatial problems than those with right-sided  cerebellar lesions. In conclusion, focal cerebellar lesions in children affect their  visuospatial ability. The impairments profile is characterized by deficits in  complex spatial processes such as visuospatial organization and mental rotation,  requiring reconstruction of visual stimuli using the imagination, while elementary  sensory analysis and perception as well as spatial processes requiring direct  manipulation of objects are relatively better preserved. This pattern is analogous  to the one previously observed in adult population and appears to be typical for  cerebellar pathology in general, regardless of age.

Front. Educ. Conf. FIE	https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2016.7757744	Classroom activities that are based in the real-world are known to be impactful. Similarly, activities that relate to social good have been found to be engaging and meaningful for students especially to those from underrepresented groups. Many times, these activities tend to be design based projects, and while meaningful, activities of that nature may not be suitable for every class. In this innovative practice paper, we will describe an approach to modeling real-world objects in SolidWorks. The goal of the modeling is to test students' technical and spatial abilities while connecting the modeling to the greater good. The SolidWorks modeling takes place in a 4000-level (senior) SolidWorks elective course where students become certified at the SolidWorks Associates Level. Team members from the Toy Adaptation Program (TAP) at The Ohio State University came into the class to discuss the purpose of their program and their work, which includes adapting toys for children with special needs. This need served as the background for a semester-long modeling project. Through the partnership, students now model toys that are adapted by the TAP. This activity brings awareness to the need for adapted toys and allows the students to use their modeling skills to create real-world objects while satisfying course requirements. © 2016 IEEE.

Ser.	https://doi.org/10.1145/1839294.1839319	Brain activation through computer training of attention and executive function could stimulate brain plasticity in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Aim: The study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a computer based training on visual spatial abilities, visual attention, executive function and visual memory, in MCI patients. Method: The participants were 59 MCI patients, age 68.08 (7.25), education 9.17 (3.93), and MMSE 27.73 (1.35), classified in one experimental (N=30) and one control group (N=29). The groups were matched in age (p= 0.60), education (p= 0.06), drugs (0.51) and gender (p= 0.52). The experimental group attended 20 weekly sessions in a period of 6 months, including tasks of visual attention, visual spatial abilities, visual memory, and executive function. The control group did not participate in any type of intervention and was in a waiting list. Neuropsychological assessment was performed at baseline and at the end of the training. Results: At baseline, there were no between groups differences in cognitive abilities. At the end of the training, between groups comparison yielded differences in favor of the experimental group in attention (p≤ 0.00), verbal fluency (p= 0.00), visual memory (p= 0.01), verbal memory (p= 0.00) and learning through feedback (p=0.00). Within group analysis of the experimental group's performance has shown improvement in attention (p=0.00) and daily function (p=0.00). Controls have shown an improvement in perseverant responses and cognitive flexibility (p≤0.00) and naming (p=0.02), and deterioration in abilities of attention (p≤0.00). Conclusion: Computer cognitive training helped the experimental group to improve attention abilities and the improvement was generalized in verbal memory and in ADL as well. Copyright 2010 ACM.

Thirty-two 3 - 5 1/2-year olds were asked to find a toy hidden in an open field. Independent of age, children who had the map found the object significantly more often than those who did not. The results are consistent with universal mapping theory in that preschool-aged children used a two-dimensional planar, scale map to find a hidden object in an open, unbounded, outdoor environment. Girls significantly outperformed boys in locating the target object, but this is appears to have been due to differences in willingness to comply with instructions, rather than differences in spatial abilities. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Two asymmetric, three-dimensional objects were  constructed from wood strips such that one object was the mirror-image of the other.  Black and white photographs were taken of these objects in various spatial  orientations along a horizontal plane. 16 photographs depicted the object  right-side-up and in 16 the object was upside-down (rotated 180 degrees in the  vertical plane). These photographs were presented to the children who were asked to  match each with the corresponding object. Analysis indicated correct judgements of  the right-side-up images occurred more frequently than the upside-down images (t11 =  4.73, p < .001). Using these data, adjustments were made to the task instructions to  provide greater clarity for the young participants.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Early competency views suggest that aspects of cognitive fundamentals are present very early in life and are in some aspects developmentally invariant. Often, the focus of research is on the delineation of the constraints which direct and restrict deployment of early intellectual abilities to illuminate the regularities and patterns in observed developmental change. The purpose of this research was to examine children's proficiency with mental rotation tasks that involved the reorientation of complex multi-component stimuli. Specifically, the existence of stimulus effect and determination of which stimulus components prove problematic under taxing performance conditions was investigated.    Sixteen students, eight first graders and eight third graders, participated in a two-choice discrimination task. Each student was assessed individually on 360 test trials in eight 20-minute sessions. Three test conditions included (1) perception, (2) memory, and (3) rotation. Two multi-component stimuli were used in which the experimenter-defined components included (A) an external protrusion on the edge of a circle, and (B) an internal axis system within the interior of the circle. The two stimuli varied in the placement of the internal axes which was either orthogonally or obliquely orientated. Test items in the memory and the rotation conditions included stimuli orthogonally oriented (90$\sp\circ$, 180$\sp\circ$, 270$\sp\circ$) obliquely oriented (45$\sp\circ$, 135$\sp\circ$, 225$\sp\circ$, 315$\sp\circ$).    Error scores were analyzed in a four-way analysis of variance. A main effect for foil type was found significant with axis foils being more difficult than protrusion foils. Furthermore, a significant four-way interaction effect was detected indicating that as stimulus characteristics and task demands increased in difficulty, performance declined particularly for the younger age group.

The following five questions were addressed: (a) Which cognitive skills should be targeted for training in order to optimize intervention efficacy? (b) Can training gains be maintained over time? (c) How general are training gains? (d) Who benefits from training? and (e) Can mnemonics be beneficial for persons with dementia? In Study 1 and 2, the first issue was examined by comparing a multifactorial memory training program (encoding operations, attentional functions, relaxation) to a unifactorial training (encoding operations), a cognitive activation program (problem solving, visuo-spatial skills) and a control group. Results showed that both multifactorial and unifactorial memory training resulted in improved performance in the criterion task (word recall) in normal adults, and that this performance gain was maintained six months after completion of training. The group receiving cognitive activation and the control group did not improve memory performance across assessments. This outcome suggests that training in encoding skills may be the critical factor for memory improvement to occur after brief intervention in normal aging. The issue of long-term maintenance of gains following memory training was examined in Study 3 by reassessing all subjects participating in the two first studies 3 1/2 years after training. Results showed that gains were maintained 3 1/2 years after completion of memory training for all groups. In Study 4, transfer of gains was studied by examining the subjects' ability to improve memory performance in tasks not used in training. The results showed that transfer of gains and maintenance of transfer were observed only in the task most closely related to the criterion task (object recall), indicating a fairly narrow scope of transfer. Three individual differences variables were used in examining the issue of who benefits from training. These were MMSE, age, and years of education. Results showed that none of the predictors were reliably related to the size of training-related gains. Given the ranges of the predictors under investigation, one interpretation is that healthy older adults benefit to a similar extent from brief memory training. The final issue addressed the beneficial effects of a face-name mnemonic technique on face-name retention duration in eight persons with dementia. Results showed that only one person out of eight improved retention duration after training. This outcome indicates that the applicability of mnemonics in persons with dementia may be limited.

The eighty subjects (39 girls, 41 boys), came from the University of Washington Child Development Research Group (CDRG) longitudinal study of precocity. Subjects had been recruited on the basis of parental belief in the child's extreme precocity in some cognitive domain (Mean IQ at Time 1 = 130). Language tests at Time 2 were the Northwestern Syntax Screening Test, the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test Passage Comprehension (verbal Cloze) Subtest, presented aurally, and the ITPA Auditory Association subtest. The spatial measures included the PMA Spatial subtest, the WISC Block Design and Mazes subtests, and a mental rotation test. The Stanford Binet IQ test was available at both occasions. Complete data on the less extensive Time 1 battery, were available for a subsample (N = 50). Spatial measures at Time 1 were the WPPSI Block Design and Mazes tests.    Factor analyses at Time 2, using LISREL IV (Linear Structural Relations by the Method of Maximum Liklihood), showed that 37% of the variance was accounted for by a general factor, 6% by a verbal factor, and 9% by a spatial factor. When analyzed separately by sex, a spatial factor accounted for 6.5% of the variance among the boys, but was unsupported for the girls. This taken with a modest sex difference (about 6% of the variance) in level of spatial performance favoring boys at both occasions, suggested that sex differences in spatial abilities may develop earlier than generally thought.    IQ at Time 1 predicted only 23% of the variance in IQ at Time 2, but the corresponding prediction for the general factor between occasions was 95%, with adjustments for age at test within occasion. The need for multiple measures, when assessing individual differences among young gifted children, was affirmed. Furthermore, individual differences in intelligence in the early years may be more stable than previously thought. Expansion of the number and variety of tests was suggested.

Children were administered either tactual-visual or visual-tactual cross-modal transfer tasks, as well as two visual imagery tasks (spatial recall and mental rotation), two language competence tasks (vocabulary and word usage), metamemory questions, and a general intelligence task. With intelligence and handedness controlled, only visual imagery related significantly to cross-modal transfer. These findings suggest that mental imagery, as opposed to language competence or metamemory, is a principal component of cross-modal transfer, and they are consistent with the observation that preverbal human infants and infrahuman primates exhibit cross-modal transfer. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.

The aim of our research was to analyze the structure of reading in good and poor readers of fourth grade children, in Slovene primary schools. With children that age, reading comprehension has already taken the central position in their reading development; reading is considered as a mastered skill, needed in the process of acquiring extensive knowledge. The application of instruments which involved the linguistic as well as the reading variables enabled us to study the latent structure of reading by means of multivariate analysis. The results manifested four latent dimensions, pointing out the particularities of the structure of reading in our sample. They also showed that the readers involved in the sample are still at the level of acquiring the reading techniques. Effective reading comprehension is influenced by many other factors - word comprehension; comprehension of rules for applying words in sentences and texts; spatial abilities, influencing an individual's ability to form inner concepts. There is a strong need for integrating analytic and synthetic levels of an individual's functioning.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The objective of the proposed test is to ascertain and assess motor impairment of functional, or presumed neurological origin. Other causes of variation, notably stature, muscular strength, spatial ability, mental level, temperamental factors, previous learning and cultural differences, have been minimised. Objective criteria of ‘pass’ or ‘fai’ have been adopted as far as possible. The Oseretzky Test of Motor Ability was used as a starling point, and the mode of administration devised by Göllnitz, making the test a measure of impairment rather than of the whole range of ability, has been maintained. Since, however, most of the items of the Oseretzky Test failed to meet the 15 criteria proposed, a virtually new test has been developed. Since the differential incidence of impairment in boys and girls affords a fairly reliable indication, other things being equal, of a congenital and possible genetic factor, all feasible sex bias has been eliminated, and both sexes perform the same tasks. Arrangements are in hand for the validation of the test in Britain, Canada and the United States. Un test genéral tic Ľincapacité motrice ties en/ants An cours du développement d'un test général de Ľincapacité motrice chez les enfants âges de 5 à 16 ans on a établi les criteres qui caractérisent un travail approprié au test. Ľobjectif du test proposé est de procurer les moyens de déterminer et évaluer Ľincapacité motrice d'origine fonctionnelle ou présumée neurologique. On a minimisé les anlres causes de variation, à savoir la stature, la force musculaire, les facultés spatiales, le niveau mental, les facteurs de tempérament, Ľétude préalable et les différences culturelles. Des critères objectifs ‘passé’ ou ‘échoué’ on été adaptés autant que possible. Le test d'Oseretzky pour la capacité motrice a été utilisé comme point de départ, et on a maintenu le mode d'administration établi par Göllnitz, faisant du test une mesure de Ľincapacité au lieu d'une mesure de la série complète des capacites. Pourtant, comme la grande majorite des articles du test d'Oseretzky n'ont pas réussi à satisfaire les critères proposés, un test virtuellement neuf a été mis au point. Comme Ľincidence différentielle d'incapacité des garçons et des filles est une indication assez digne de confiance, toutes autres choses étant égales, d'un facteur congénital, et peut‐être génètique, toute tendance sexuelle a étééliminée et les deux sexes exécutent les mêmes traveaux. On est entrain d'arranger la validation de ce test en Grande‐Bretagne, au Canada et aux Etats‐Unis. Copyright © 1966, Wiley Blackwell.

This is a simplified version of the posting task that is commonly used to measure dorsal stream functioning. The experiments identify marked developmental changes in children’s ability to preorient objects for insertion, with 18-month-olds failing completely and 24-month-olds succeeding easily. In marked contrast, 18-month-olds preorient their empty hands for insertion into the same slots. This developmental dissociation between aligning hands and aligning objects to slots suggests that the key developmental change is in action with the goal of object-to-object alignment versus action on an object.

Objectives: Assessment the relationship between auditory and vestibular information with specific motor and cognitive functions. Methods: Posturography in 17 Pre-lingual Cochlear Implant Adolescents, (PCIA) age 14.06 ± 3.05 in four sensory conditions was analyzed: (A) eyes open, cochlear implant (CI) on, (B) eyes open, CI off, (C) eyes closed standing on a foam over a platform (ECFP) with CI on, and (D) ECFP, CI off. Gait velocity (GV) was registered by inertial sensors using a 10-meter test. Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) was evaluated with the video head impulse test (VHIT) and visual spatial skill (VS) assessed with the WISC-V test. Results: SV had no significant difference between conditions A and B (p =.2461). Comparing C and D, SV values decreased when CI was turned on (p =.0036). A significant linear relationship between VOR and GV (p =.0064) generating the VOR gain loss lower gait. Relationship between VOR and VS scores was no significant (p =.685). Conclusions and significance: Auditory information is a relevant cue when somatosensory and visual inputs are modified and range of vestibular function influence in a dynamic motor activity as gait, facts which must be considered in the neurodevelopment control. © 2019, © 2019 Acta Oto-Laryngologica AB (Ltd).

Spatial performance, measured using two subtests of a computerized spatial skills battery, was significantly better in boys than in girls during pretest assessment. Subjects then practiced on an action video game, Marble Madness, or a computerized word game, Conjecture. Video game practice was significantly more effective than the word game in improving spatial performance on the posttest assessment; there was no significant interaction of gender with experimental treatment. However, video game practice was more effective for children who started out with relatively poor spatial skills. The pattern of results suggests that video games may be useful in equalizing individual differences in spatial skill performance, including those associated with gender. © 1994.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01626	Play offers an unparalleled opportunity for young children to gain cognitive skills in informal settings. Block play in particular-including interactions with parents  around block constructions-teaches children about intrinsic spatial features of  objects (size, shape) and extrinsic spatial relations. In turn, early spatial  cognition paves the way for later competencies in math and science. We assessed 4-  and 5-year-old children's spatial skill on a set of block-building constructions and  examined mother-child block building interactions in 167 U.S. dyads from African  American, Dominican, Mexican, and Chinese backgrounds. At both ages, children were  instructed to copy several 3D block constructions, followed by a "break" during  which mothers and children were left alone with the blocks. A form that contained  pictures of test items was left on the table. Video-recordings of mother-child  interactions during the break were coded for two types of building behaviors -  test-specific construction (building structures on the test form) or free-form  construction (building structures not on the test form). Chinese children  outperformed Mexican, African American, and Dominican children on the block-building  assessment. Further, Chinese and Mexican mother-child dyads spent more time building  test-specific constructions than did African American and Dominican dyads. At an  individual level, mothers' time spent building test-specific constructions at the  4-year (but not 5-year) assessment, but not mothers' initiation of block building  interactions or verbal instructions, related to children's performance, when  controlling for ethnicity. Ethnic differences in children's block-building  performance and experiences emerge prior to formal schooling and provide a valuable  window into sources of individual differences in early spatial cognition.

Acta neurologica Belgica	https://doi.org/10.1007/s13760-021-01613-5	Levetiracetam (LEV) and oxcarbazepine (OXC) are commonly used in the treatment of epilepsy, but their efficacy and safety have seldom been compared for the treatment  of children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS). We thus  assessed the efficacy of LEV and OXC monotherapy in the treatment of children with  BECTS, and the effect of this treatment on children's intelligence and cognitive  development. This was a randomized, single-center trial. Children with BECTS were  randomized (1:1) into LEV and OXC groups, and were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months  after treatment. The primary outcomes were the frequency of seizures and changes in  intelligence and cognitive function. Secondary outcomes were electroencephalogram  (EEG) results and safety. Seventy children were enrolled and randomized to the LEV  group or the OXC group, and 32 of the 35 children in each group completed the study.  After 6 months, the effective treatment rate of the OXC group was significantly  higher than that of the LEV group (78.12 vs. 53.12%, p = 0.035). However, no  significant inter-group difference was observed in EEG improvement (p = 0.211). In  terms of intelligence and cognitive development, children in the OXC group exhibited  significantly improved choice reaction time, mental rotation, and Wisconsin Card  Sorting Test results (all p < 0.05). Both LEV and OXC were well tolerated, with  18.75 and 21.88% of children reporting mild adverse events (p = 0.756). OXC  monotherapy was more effective than LEV for children with BECTS. In addition,  children with OXC monotherapy had higher improvements in children's intelligence and  cognitive function than those with LEV monotherapy.

This ability to recognize whether a melody is the same or altered when it is played back in a different key is correlated with both greater neural activation and cortical thickness in bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Musical training only explains part of this finding, suggesting that the ability to transpose a melody may have innate predispositions. The current study was designed to address this question: are the anatomical correlates of musical transposition already present in non-musician children at 14 years of age? If so, is there any evidence that those traits were already in place at earlier ages? To answer this question, we recruited 47 adolescents (age 14.5 years) from a longitudinal study and tested them on a melodic transposition task. These adolescents had already undergone anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the ages of 10 (Time 1), 11.5 (Time 2), 13 (Time 3) years, as well as at age 14.5 years (Time 4) They were tested on the transposition task during Time-4 visit. During this visit, we found a relationship between cortical thickness in left IPS and performance on the transposed melody task in the girls and not the boys; no such relationship was observed at any of the earlier ages. Given that girls reach more advanced staged of pubertal maturation earlier than boys, it is possible that the relationship between cortical thickness in IPS and skill at melodic transposition only emerges once the brain has reached a certain degree of maturity. This claim is supported by a lack of similar sex differences in the adults: the degree of correlation between cortical thickness and performance on the same transposed melody task did not differ between men and women in a previous study. Taken together, our results suggest that the relationship between cortical thickness and the ability to transpose a melody is not fixed, and that the effects observed in adults are neither due exclusively to training nor to predisposition. © 2013 Sutherland, Paus and Zatorre.

Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development has been one of the most influential theories in the field of cognitive mapping research. Two essential elements of Piaget's theory regarding the developmental sequence of spatial abilities with age are nativism and constructivism. A forum in the Annals of the Association of American Geographers journal in 1997 on the mapping abilities of young children helped to distinguish the intrinsic duality of Piaget's developmental theory and its influence on the debate between Blaut and Downs/Liben. Both Blaut and Downs/Liben studied young children's ontogenetic development of mapping abilities, but they examined different aspects of Piaget's theory. On the basis of nativism, Blaut recognized that children can perform various mapping tasks regardless of age, and he insisted that children naturally possess mapping abilities, whereas Piaget implied that they could not. In contrast, on the basis of constructivism, Downs and his colleagues emphasized that children's mapping abilities are the effect of both direct and indirect learning experience, and they pointed out some deficiencies in Blaut's testing method. In spite of their contrasting standpoints, both researchers were influenced by Piaget's theories, but emphasized different aspects of the complex process of cognitive mapping development.

Our aim was to scrutinize the domain specificity of exercise effects on cognition, while controlling for the other sources of heterogeneity. In a population based sample consisting of 472 males and 668 females (aged 10-86. years old) we administered the Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which provided accuracy and speed measures of abstraction and mental flexibility, attention, working memory, memory (verbal, face, and spatial), language and nonverbal reasoning, spatial ability, emotion identification, emotion- and age differentiation, sensorimotor speed, and motor speed. Using univariate and multivariate regression models, CNB scores were associated with participants' average energy expenditure per week (weekly METhours), which were derived from a questionnaire on voluntary regular leisure time exercise behavior.Univariate models yielded generally positive associations between weekly METhours and cognitive accuracy and speed, but multivariate modeling demonstrated that direct relations were small and centered around zero. The largest and only significant effect size (β = 0.11, p < 0.001) was on the continuous performance test, which measures attention. Our results suggest that in the base population, any chronic effects of voluntary regular leisure time exercise on cognition are limited. Only a relation between exercise and attention inspires confidence. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In most patients the deletion occurs de novo, but autosomal inheritance with variable expression is observed. Its major features are a cleft palate or velopharyngeal insufficiency, cardiac anomalies, typical facial appearance, learning disabilities and/or mental retardation. We report data on a group of 37 VCFS patients with particular attention to their intelligence, behaviour and social competence. Results Intelligence Learning difficulties (defined as FSIQ < 70 or >2 S.D. below the mean) were found in 45%. In the majority of them, the learning difficulties were mild (38%) and only 2 patients had moderate learning difficulties. Severe learning difficulties seem to be rare in VCFS. Only one child with a familial deletion and cerebellar hypoplasia was severely retarded. In the present study, 8 patients were initially referred for diagnosis because of developmental delay. This could have introduced a bias in the study. However, we found no difference in FSIQ between this group of patients and the remaining patients. Our findings are therefore representative for VCFS, irrespective of their referral pattern. Also, in this series, 37 consecutively diagnosed patients were examined, thus eliminating a further possible bias. We found also a wide variability in intelligence in VCFS patients. Until now there were no good explanations for this variability in intelligence (e.g. no correlation with the extent of the deletion). Also we found no correlation between intelligence and the presence or absence of a congenital heart defect. However, the incidence of learning difficulties was found to be much higher in the patients with a familial deletion versus patients with a de novo deletion. We found a statistically (Student T-test and IQ > 30) significant difference of 16.6 IQ-points between the mean FSIQ of the patients with a «familial» deletion (mean FSIQ 63.2) and the mean FSIQ of the patients with a «de novo» deletion (mean FSIQ 79.8). As far as we know, this has not been reported in VCFS. This difference, however, can possibly be explained in part by lower educational level of affected parents versus unaffected parents. Indeed, parental IQ and socioeconomic status is a major determining factor of the IQ in their children, and this was here estimated by their educational level. The parent in familial cases, not carrying the deletion, had a lower SES compared to parents of de novo cases, suggesting assortative mating. Associated cerebral malformations could also be a possible explanation: in the present study the boy with severe learning difficulties showed a cerebral malformation, although other researchers did not find such a correlation. Besides the distribution of intelligence, the present study also revealed data on the intelligence profile of these children. Analysis of the Weschler subscales showed a statistically significant difference between the average Verbal IQ and average Performance IQ. Subtest analysis was not done because of the small number if children tested by the WISC-R (n = 11). In most children however, specific cognitive deficits (i.e. visuo-perceptual-spatial ability and planning ability) could be suspected from the profile of the WISC-R. These results indicate that children with VCFS possibly might have a higher risk for developing problems in the field of visuoperceptual-spatial abilities and of executive functioning. This needs further investigation in a larger patient group, however. Behaviour In the toddler group (children between 2-3 years; n = 6), somatic complaints («constipation», and «eats poor») and (social) withdrawal were reported in 5 of the 6 children on the CBCL. Only one child had a total T-score within the clinical range (T > 63). For the older children and adolescents (n = 19) highest scores were found on «Social Problems» (average T-score of 64), «Attention problems» (average T-score of 64) and «Withdrawn» (average T-score of 58). Post hoc statistical testing (Scheffe's test) shows that the clusters «Social Problems» and «Attention Problems» score statistically significantly higher than the other clusters of problem behaviour, except the cluster «Withdrawn». In addition to social and attention problems, our data also point to higher scores on the anxious/depression syndrome in the older children (11 years and older). Adolescent and adult patients with VCFS are at risk for developing psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and depression. The most common symptoms described in these reports are those associated with depression and anxiety disorders and include disturbed mood, severe vegetative symptoms, disturbed appetite, fatigue, and low self-esteem, as well as poor concentration and decision-making ability. Therefore, the finding in this study of higher levels on the depression/anxious syndrome in the older group is of interest, since this could be a first sign of developing psychopathology. Further prospective studies are needed to address this question. A multidisciplinary clinic will be organised in the near future, to deal with the different aspects (cardiac, genetic, paediatric, speech, social, cognitive, educational and psychiatric) of this disorder.

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	https://doi.org/10.1076/0929-7049(199912)05:04;1-R;FT230	In this exploratory study, the neuropsychological and learning profile of nine primary school age children with velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS) was studied by  systematic neuropsychological testing. In five out of nine children, the following  profile was found: a VIQ-PIQ discrepancy (in favor of the VIQ), significantly better  scores (.05 level) for reading (decoding) and spelling compared to arithmetic,  deficient tactile-perceptual skills (difficulties mainly on the left side of the  body), weak but not deficient visual-perceptual abilities, deficient visual-spatial  skills, extremely poor psychomotor skills (gross motor skills more deficient than  fine motor skills), problems with processing of new and complex material, poor  visual attention, good auditory memory and relatively good language skills. These  findings correspond to the pattern of neuropsychological assets and deficits that  has been described for the syndrome of nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD)  (Rourke, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1995). The psychosocial profile of all nine children with  VCFS also correspond to that of children with NLD. Further studies on the  relationship between cognitive function, behavior, psychiatric disorder and  abnormalities in brain anatomy in young people with VCFS will be needed. In clinical  practice, it is worthwhile exploring in greater depth the neuropsychological  functions of children with VCFS to rule out NLD, since they may benefit from  specific remediation following the learning principles of the NLD-treatment.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.1984.58.1.79	The relationship between lateral eye-movement patterns and visual spatial abilities was investigated for a sample of 94 right-handed junior high school boys and girls. Direction of gaze was recorded during reflection on a complex gross motor skill. Subjects were administered the Group Embedded Figures Test, the Kohs ' Block Design Test, the Hidden Figures Test, the Hidden Patterns Test, the Closure and Perceptual Speed Tests. Apart from the Group Embedded Figures Test and the Hidden Figures Test, low but significant positive relationships between proportion of left lateral eye-movements and visual spatial test scores were found. If lateral eye-movements are indicators of differential hemispheric activation, people with right-hemisphere predominance are more successful in solving certain visual-perceptual problems than people with left-hemisphere predominance. Finally, it is proposed that in studying relationships between lateral direction of eye-movements and field-dependence/independence, a more fruitful approach would be to investigate how people differ in their problem-solving styles to cope with embedded-figures test material in addition to determination of the performance level.

Metabolic brain disease	https://doi.org/10.1007/s11011-014-9497-4	Although animal evidence indicates that early life trauma results in pervasive hippocampal deficits underlying spatial and cognitive impairment, visuo-spatial data  from adult humans with early childhood adversity are lacking.

We observed a significant effect of trauma history on  spatial/pattern learning. These effects could not be accounted for by adverse adult  experiences, and were sex-specific, with prior adversity improving performance in  men but worsening performance in women, relative to controls. Limitations include  the small sample size and reliance of our study design on a retrospective, self  report measure.

The learning problems in SLD children were mainly due to poor phonological skill but not much was known about the contribution of visuospatial difficulties. Therefore, this study aims to determine the relationship between phonological awareness skills and global visual-spatial abilities among Malay speaking children with SLD, and to compare children with SLD and typical readers on intellectual functioning, phonological awareness and global visual-spatial ability. An equal number of typical readers (n = 36) and children with SLD were recruited. Data were coded and analysed using Kendall's Tau-b, independent samples t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results showed phonological skills have strong negative correlation with global visual-spatial ability (r = .55). The typical readers have significantly higher IQ and better phonological skills and better global visual-spatial skills as compared to the group with SLD. However, there is no conclusive evidence due to specificity of more than one area measured by the assessment tools. Nevertheless, it provides a direction for future research to look into global visual-spatial aspects of SLD to aid in educational instruction in the future, in addition to the long-standing phonology deficit theory. © 2018, Malaysian Public Health Physicians Association.

Developmental science	https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12144	We determined how various cognitive abilities, including several measures of a proposed domain-specific number sense, relate to mathematical competence in nearly  100 9-year-old children with normal reading skill. Results are consistent with an  extended number processing network and suggest that important processing nodes of  this network are phonological processing, verbal knowledge, visuo-spatial short-term  and working memory, spatial ability and general executive functioning. The model was  highly specific to predicting arithmetic performance. There were no strong relations  between mathematical achievement and verbal short-term and working memory, sustained  attention, response inhibition, finger knowledge and symbolic number comparison  performance. Non-verbal intelligence measures were also non-significant predictors  when added to our model. Number sense variables were non-significant predictors in  the model and they were also non-significant predictors when entered into regression  analysis with only a single visuo-spatial WM measure. Number sense variables were  predicted by sustained attention. Results support a network theory of mathematical  competence in primary school children and falsify the importance of a proposed  modular 'number sense'. We suggest an 'executive memory function centric' model of  mathematical processing. Mapping a complex processing network requires that studies  consider the complex predictor space of mathematics rather than just focusing on a  single or a few explanatory factors.

One dimension of cognitive style, the field dependent-independent continuum, describes an individual's tendency to perceive parts of a field as independent from the surrounding whole.    Procedures. The subjects for the study were fifth-grade students from a large surburban school system. The researcher administered a battery of seven mathematics tests. The Children's Embedded Figures Test, and the Primary Mental Abilities test of Spatial Relations were given to the students also. Scores from the Cognitive Abilities Test were used as measures of intelligence.    Selected Findings and Conclusions. Analysis of the data showed the following results for students of this age level. There were no significant differences in levels of field dependence-independence, intelligence, and achievement in mathematics content areas for males and females. Males scored significantly higher than females in spatial ability. The CEFT correlated moderately well with all mathematics content areas, at significant levels, for males. The correlations between the CEFT and mathematics areas were consistently low and nonsignificant for females. When considered jointly with the other independent variables, the CEFT was the best variable in predicting addition and subtraction scores for males. More of the variance in mathematics achievement scores was explained by the independent variables in this study for males than for females. Spatial ability and the CEFT correlated highly for both sexes. In the regression analysis, the amount of variance attributable to the CEFT was very small after intelligence was partialled out.    The following conclusions were drawn from the data analysis. There are greater within sex differences than between sex differences in mathematics achievement, intelligence, and field dependence-independence. There are small, but persistent, differences between sexes in spatial ability. The test of field-independence is a good predictor of mathematics achievement for males, but not for females. Field dependence-independence relates differently to different mathematics content areas when the combined effects of the independent variables are assessed. It correlates better with computational achievement than it does with problem solving, geometry, and measurement. Field dependence-independence correlates well with verbal and nonverbal intelligence for males. It correlates with nonverbal, but not verbal ability for females. There is considerable overlap between field dependence-independence and spatial ability. Knowledge about cognitive style does not make an appreciable addition to the prediction of intelligence test information in predicting mathematics performance.

NF1 patients are at risk to develop neurofibromas and other tumors, such as optic pathway gliomas and other tumors of the central nervous system. Few studies have investigated the impact of an additional diagnosis of brain tumor on the cognitive outcome of children with NF1, showing unclear results and without controlling by the effect of surgery, radio-or chemotherapy. In the present mono-institutional study, we compared the behavioral and cognitive outcomes of 26 children with neurofibromatosis alone (NF1) with two age-matched groups of 26 children diagnosed with NF1 and untreated optic pathway glioma (NF1 + OPG) and 19 children with NF1 and untreated other central nervous system tumors (NF1 + CT). NF1 + CT and NF1 + OPG showed significantly impaired cognitive abilities compared to NF1 group, with weaknesses in visuo-spatial abilities, visual scanning and verbal working memory, while general verbal abilities are preserved. Moreover, NF1 + OPG patients present more frequent internalizing problems and increased oppositional-deviant behaviors. These results suggest that the co-diagnosis of a brain tumor in NF1 children may partially worsen the cognitive and emotional outcome. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Spatial ability was assessed after active music instruction using Orff xylophones, active singing instruction, or a passive listener-oriented approach. Kindergartners (N = 68) from 3 intact classrooms, stratified for gender, were randomly assigned to 3 groups: (1) xylophone (n = 28), (2) singing (n = 26), and (3) passive music (n = 14). The lessons for active groups 1 and 2 were identical except for the variable of xylophone instruction. Children learned the same songs, movements, unpitched instrument accompaniments, and read the same simple iconic musical notation. However, during part of the lesson group 1 used xylophones as accompaniments and to sight-read iconic notation, while group 2 (singing) continued to use unpitched instruments as accompaniments and Kodaly hand-signals to sight-read the same iconic notation. Passive group 3 did no singing, playing, moving, or music reading but listened to and talked about music. The instructor taught bi-weekly 30-minute music classes for 4 months; IQ’s were measured using 5 subtests (Performance Scale) of the Weschler Primary and Preschool Intelligence Scale - Revised (WPPSI - R) (1989) by a school psychometrist. To control for WPPSI - R practice effects, half of group 1 (n = 14) and group 2 (n = 14) were pre-tested while half of group 1 ( n = 14) and group 2 (n = 12), and all of group 3 (n = 14) were not pre-tested. All were post-tested six months later. There were no practice effects. To compare groups raw scores were used as there were no significant age differences among groups. No significant differences were found. However, consistent with other studies a trend (p < .06) towards enhanced performance on the xylophone group’s Object Assembly (OA) subtest was found when compared with the passive music group. A similar trend (p < .06) was found on Block Design, the subtest that most highly correlates with OA. A ceiling effect may have constrained growth due to music instruction as 21% of the xylophone group’s OA scores were perfect or near perfect.

database	Tai, Tzu-Ching	2010	thesis	The effect of violin, keyboard, and singing instruction on the spatial ability and music aptitude of young children		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/effect-violin-keyboard-singing-instruction-on/docview/762372415/se-2	The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of violin, keyboard, and singing instruction on spatial ability and music aptitude of children ages four to seven years. Specifically, this research attempted to determine: (a) whether formal music learning in the violin, keyboard and singing conditions enhanced children’s spatial ability and music aptitude, and (b) whether children’s spatial ability and music aptitude differed among these learning conditions. In addition, this study sought to examine the relationships among children’s age, their development of spatial ability, and music aptitude in the given music instruction.   A pretest-posttest two by three factorial design was employed in the study. Children (N=88) ages four to seven years were randomly assigned to one of three instructional groups (violin, keyboard, or singing) and received 45 minutes of music instruction four times a week for 16 days. Spatial reasoning skills were measured using two subtests, the Object Assembly and the Block Design of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III, while music aptitude was measured using the Primary Measures of Music Audiation or the  Intermediate Measures of Music Audiation.   An ANOVA with repeated measures was used to analyze children’s mean scores on spatial abilities and music aptitude. Using an alpha level of .05, results indicated that the violin and keyboard groups significantly improved on spatial-temporal reasoning over four weeks of music instruction. The spatial-temporal reasoning scores of 4-5 year olds significantly increased from the pretest to posttest while the scores of 6-7 year olds remained statistically constant. Regarding music aptitude, the tonal aptitude scores of 4-5 year olds singing group significantly increased over four weeks of music instruction. No statistically significant differences were found on the spatial recognition and rhythm aptitude scores among the three instructional groups for either age level.   The study concluded that (a) violin and keyboard instruction might influence the spatial-temporal reasoning of young children, (b) younger children’s spatial-temporal reasoning ability might be more enhanced by music instruction than those of older children, and (c) singing instruction appears to help young children develop their tonal aptitude. Pedagogical implications for music education were discussed.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The visual organization theory, which holds that vision provides a frame of reference for spatial information from other sensory modalities, was examined with regard to performance in the tactual domain. This theory had previously received minimal research attention within the population of young, partially sighted, children. In the present study, it was expected that control subjects would demonstrate more proficient performance on tactual tasks than visually impaired subjects. The visually impaired subjects were evaluated as to differences based on degree and etiology (Albinism, Bilateral Congenital Cataract, and Retinopathy of Prematurity) of visual loss. The research protocol included measures of verbal, visual perceptual, visual spatial, tactual, and orientation in space, abilities.    Significant differences among the visually impaired subjects, based on degree of visual loss, were evident on some tasks in the tactual domain and lent support to the visual frame of reference theory. Visually impaired children demonstrated worse performance than control subjects in the area of visual spatial skills, and those with a severe degree of visual impairment were more likely to demonstrate a significant discrepancy between verbal and visual spatial skills. Regression analysis showed that visual acuity status was a more significant predictor of performance on dependent measures than etiology of the visual impairment. Visually impaired subjects with an etiology of Retinopathy of Prematurity demonstrated deficits in visual perceptual and visual spatial skills in comparison to both normally sighted and other visually impaired subjects.    The presence of some differences in the cognitive profiles of visually impaired and control subjects indicated the importance of comprehensive neuropsychological assessment for children with partial vision impairment. Directions for further research included study of the development of tactual spatial skills in the visually impaired, and longitudinal follow-up of specific etiology groups, especially visually impaired children with Retinopathy of Prematurity.

Child Neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1080/09297049.2016.1225707	The aim of this study is to investigate whether sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms are associated with neurocognitive task performance and ratings of real-world executive functioning (EF) in preschoolers at risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The associations between parent- and teacher-rated SCT symptoms and neuropsychological task performance and ratings of EF in 61 4-year-old preschool children (51 boys, 10 girls) with self-regulation difficulties were examined, with regression analyses controlling for the effects of ADHD inattention symptoms. In the study sample, higher teacher-rated SCT symptoms are significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of visual-perceptual abilities, auditory and visual attention, sustained and selective attention, inhibitory control, pre-numerical/numerical concepts, and slower processing speed, but SCT symptoms are not significantly associated with working memory, attention shifting or cognitive flexibility when controlling for ADHD inattention. Higher parent-rated SCT symptoms are significantly associated with visual-perceptual abilities. ADHD inattention symptoms are more strongly associated than SCT with daily life EF ratings; neither parent- nor teacher-rated SCT symptoms are significantly associated with daily life ratings of inhibition, working memory, or planning/organization after controlling for ADHD inattention. This study suggests that SCT symptoms contribute to EF deficits at least on neurocognitive tasks assessing visual-perceptual/spatial abilities, attention to detail and processing speed, as observed in this sample of young children at risk for ADHD, and may be an important intervention target. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Sex differences in memory and spatial skills further suggest that males and females differ in hippocampal structure and function. We conducted the first meta-analysis of male-female difference in hippocampal volume (HCV) based on published MRI studies of healthy participants of all ages, to test whether the structure is reliably sexually dimorphic. Using four search strategies, we collected 68 matched samples of males' and females' uncorrected HCVs (in 4418 total participants), and 36 samples of male and female HCVs (2183 participants) that were corrected for individual differences in total brain volume (TBV) or intracranial volume (ICV). Pooled effect sizes were calculated using a random-effects model for left, right, and bilateral uncorrected HCVs and for left and right HCVs corrected for TBV or ICV. We found that uncorrected HCV was reliably larger in males, with Hedges' g values of 0.545 for left hippocampus, 0.526 for right hippocampus, and 0.557 for bilateral hippocampus. Meta-regression revealed no effect of age on the sex difference in left, right, or bilateral HCV. In the subset of studies that reported it, both TBV (g = 1.085) and ICV (g = 1.272) were considerably larger in males. Accordingly, studies reporting HCVs corrected for individual differences in TBV or ICV revealed no significant sex differences in left and right HCVs (Hedges' g ranging from + 0.011 to - 0.206). In summary, we found that human males of all ages exhibit a larger HCV than females, but adjusting for individual differences in TBV or ICV results in no reliable sex difference. The frequent claim that women have a disproportionately larger hippocampus than men was not supported. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Animal studies suggest that testosterone modulates cognitive function through enhancing acetylcholine release and up-modulation of nicothinic receptors. Tau protein deposition is also affected by androgen supplementation in animals. We hypothesize that testosterone replacement in elderly hypogonadal males may improve cognition, in particular the visual-spatial domain. Thirty-six male patients with a new diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease had their total and bioavailable testosterone levels rneasured. None of the patients had been on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Ten of the 36 patients (28%) were deemed biochemically hypogonadal (total testosterone < 240 ng/dl or 7 nmol/l). Five of the hypogonadal patients were randomized to testosterone and five to placebo. Initial Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAScog) and Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) ranged from 31 to 19 and from 17 to 22, respectively. The clock drawing test (CDT) and the pentagon-tracing portion of the MMSE were used as measures of visual-spatial abilities. Normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were essential before treatment with intramuscular testosterone, 200 mg every 2 weeks. Measurement of testosterone, complete blood count, lipids, PSA and neuropsychological cognitive tests were repeated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of treatment. In the testosterone-treated group, levels of total testosterone increased from a mean of 126.4 ng/dl to 341 ng/dl or 3.6 nmol/1 to 9.7 nmol/l (p = 0.11). Bioavailable testosterone also increased from a mean of 48.7 ng/dl to 142 ng/dl or 1.39 nmol/1 to 4.05 nmol/1 (p = 0.10). PSA levels were also elevated from a mean of 0.98 to 1.37 ng/ml (p = 0.07). ADAScog improved from a mean of 25 to 16.3 (p = 0.02); MMSE improved from a mean of 19.4 to 23.2 (p = 0.02), CDT also improved from 2.2 to 3.2 (p = 0.07). One patient stopped treatment because of hypersexual behavior. The placebo-treated group deteriorated gradually. This small pilot study performed in aging, male patients suggests that testosterone could indeed improve cognition, including visual-spatial skills in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

ExperimentI:The apparatus used were a bowling pin and a bowling ball(two objects situation)and a model of three mountains on a base(three objects situation).A little doll was placed at a number'of different positions one by one and the child was asked to imagine the changes in appearance that will accompany the doll's movements. In both situations,the following three types of tasks were given. a)The child was shown a collection of pictures of the objects taken from various points of view and asked to choose the suitable one from them. b)The child was shown pictures one by one and asked to identify the position which the doll must occupy. c)The child was given two or three pieces of cardboard which has the same shape and colour with those of the objects above mentioned and asked to arrange them to reproduce the scene as seen from a given position.The child remained stationary during the experiments.After this the child,who failed the task c),was told to sit at other positions and to reproduce the scene as seen from the position which he had once occupied.It was aimed at investigating the effect of the experience. One hundred and twenty six children from4:11 years to13:11years participated in the experiments. ExperimentII:This was undertaken to complement Exp.I and analyze the parameters which determine the difficulty of the task. The parameters tested here were those of the number of objects(two or three),the number of dimensions involved(one or two),and the type of transformation(before-behind. Nbehind-before,before- behind. left-right,left-right. before-behind,leftright. oright-lgt).The procedure was essentially the same with that of Exp.I. One hundred and thirty children from5:4years to12:1years participated in the experiment. The following findings were obtained:1)Children's representation of spatial transformation developed step by step.When the task involved only one dimension,children became able to represent all types of transformation by9or10years,and when the task involved two dimensions, by11or12 years.The effect of experience was not so large, but the effect became larger in older children.3) As to the difficulty of the task of transformation, the type of transformation before-behind. behind-.before was easiest,left-right. before-behind was next,before-behind. left-right was rather difficult and left-right.>right-left was most difficult.4)The parameter of the number of objects did not determine the difficulty of the task so much,but the parameter of the number of dimensions involved determined the difficulty of the task. © 1968, The Japanese Association of Educational Psychology.

Detection is typically achieved by fluorescence in situ hybridization after diagnosis of one of the major features of the deletion or via chromosomal microarray or noninvasive prenatal testing. The physical phenotype can include congenital heart defects, palatal and pharyngeal anomalies, hypocalcemia/hypoparathyroidism, skeletal abnormalities, and cranial/brain anomalies, although prevalence rates of all these features are variable. Cognitive function is impaired to some degree in most individuals, with prevalence rates of greater than 90% for motor/speech delays and learning disabilities. Attention, executive function, working memory, visual-spatial abilities, motor skills, and social cognition/social skills are affected. The deletion is also associated with an increased risk for behavioral disorders and psychiatric illness. The early onset of psychiatric symptoms common to 22q11.2DS disrupts the development and quality of life of individuals with the syndrome and is also a potential risk factor for later development of a psychotic disorder. This review discusses prevalence, phenotypic features, and management of psychiatric disorders commonly diagnosed in children and adolescents with 22q11.2DS, including autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia/psychotic disorders. Guidelines for the clinical assessment and management of psychiatric disorders in youth with this syndrome are provided, as are treatment guidelines for the use of psychiatric medications.

Journal of eye movement research	https://doi.org/10.16910/jemr.12.8.2	The effects of gender, strategy and task characteristics on children's mental rotation (MR) behavioral measures and eye movements were studied. Eye movements  reflect thinking pattern and assist understanding mental rotation performance.  Eighty-three fourth-grade children (44 boys and 39 girls) were administered the  Computerized Windows Mental Rotation test (CWMR) while having their eye movements  monitored and completed a Strategy Self-Report (global/local/combined) and a Spatial  Span (WM) subtest. Difficulty level affected performance and was reflected in a  different eye movement pattern. Boys were more accurate than girls, but they did not  differ in their eye movement pattern. Eye movement pattern was related to strategy,  accu-racy and reaction time, revealing that the global and combined strategy were  more effective compared with local strategy. WM was found to correlate with accuracy  at the easy level of the test. The usage of eye movement measures assists in  elaborating our knowledge regarding MR performance among chil-dren and enable a  wider understanding regarding the interaction between gender, strategy and  difficulty level.

Games for health journal	https://doi.org/10.1089/g4h.2020.0128	Objective: This article examined older adults' performance on two components of a mental rotation task (reaction time and rotation rate) in a home-based intervention  study of videogame (Crazy Taxi [CT]) and computerized cognitive training  (PositScience InSight). Materials and Methods: Participants were randomized to one  of three groups: one group played an off-the-shelf videogame (i.e., CT), the second  group engaged in a computerized training program focused on fast perceptual  comparisons, visuospatial working memory, rapid scanning of a visual array and  pattern recognition, visual discrimination, and selective and divided attention and  processing speed (i.e., InSight), and the third (control) group received no  training. Training in the two intervention conditions consisted of 60 training  sessions of 1 hour each, which were completed in 3 months (5 hours a week). As part  of a larger study, participants received mental rotation testing, which was  administered immediately before (baseline), after (post-test), and 3 months after  (follow-up) training. Results: Although the InSight group showed greater  improvements in rotation rate at the immediate post-test, by the 3-month follow-up,  the combined treatment groups (CT and InSight) had improved more than controls.  Conclusion: The improvements in mental rotation performance found at 3-month  follow-up add additional support to previous research, showing visuospatial benefits  of both videogame play and cognitive training in older adults. Common elements of  both interventions may include expansion of the attentional field of view and faster  visual comparison efficiency.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

While spatial ability measures correlate with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) success, a focus on spatial thinking is all but missing in elementary school education. Fourth-grade students took part in the program and then completed spatial thinking assessments or completed the assessments prior to program participation. All students completed assessments at three points in time-before, during, and after the intervention. Results suggest the program's promise in promoting spatial thinking, showing both spatial thinking gains and extensive engagement in the program. Questionnaire responses suggest the program may have particular appeal for girls, which could play a role in reducing gender disparities in spatial reasoning and in situations where spatial thinking can be applied. © Taylor & Francis Group.

The  results were consistent with the notion that the behavioural phenotype of mixed TS  involving predominantly mosaic karyotypes is less deviant from the normal pattern  than that of pure 45XO. The results for the pure TS girls were consistent with an  exaggeration of a normal sex difference, but for mixed TS girls this effect was  task-dependent. There was no evidence of generalised deficiency or immaturity, and  the task-specific effects support modularity in the development of components of  cognitive skill and spatial ability. They also support a specific overall  intellectual profile in TS, but with considerable inter-individual variation in its  expression.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Studies of Turner's Syndrome (TS), in which their is functional absence of the information carried on the short arm of the second X chromosome, have emphasised disorders of spatial skill and potential abnormality of the parietal lobes or right hemisphere. In contrast, language skills have received little investigation despite suggestions by Shaffer of considerable verbal skill. This paper reports on an analysis of reading skill, in girls with TS. The girls with TS attained reading levels higher than those predicted on the basis of their age and intelligence. Moreover, they attained significantly higher reading levels than controls. Unlike many previous studies of hyperlexia, reading comprehension was also better than controls. The hyperlexia of the girls with TS was characterised by strength in both lexical reading systems, as assessed by the ability to read irregular words, and strength in alphabetical or phonological reading skills, as assessed by the ability to read long unfamiliar regular words. Hyperlexia need not therefore co-occur with comprehension difficulties nor need it reflect strength in only part of the reading system. In TS it appears to represent a genuine hyperdevelopment of a skill. The strength of reading skill counterbalances the spatial difficulties of a comparable sample of girls with TS, and with other verbal skills may potentially be exploited in remedial enterprises.

There was a significant overall effect of group reflecting impaired spatial cognition in T.S. with greater decrement in the 45XO group. Further investigation of the significant group by task interaction indicated that the group effects appeared on a visuo-perceptual task and on three visuo-constructional tasks but that there were no specific deficits in the T.S. groups on visuo-spatial or tactile-spatial tasks. In T.S., visuo-perceptual and visuo-constructive subsystems of spatial skill may-be more vulnerable than other components of spatial cognition, to the neuro-biological influences which contribute to the disorder. Such dissociation supports theories of modularity in the development of spatial skill. The spatial tasks which create difficulty overlap only partially with those for which there are sex differences amongst normal children and do not represent a simple exaggeration of normal male-female differences. © 1995, Masson S.p.A..

Four facets of development are reviewed in this paper: 1. Brain development and thyroid hormone metabolism. 2. Hepatic effects. 3. Hematopoietic system effects. 4. Lung function. Effects on IQ and behaviour have been documented in children on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Non-dioxin-like PCBs, measured in maternal and cord blood and current plasma samples have been implicated. Interference with thyroid hormone metabolism in the mother, in the foetus and in the newborn baby could be responsible for these effects on brain development. During early gestation the foetus is completely dependent on maternal thyroxine (T4). Lower T4 levels in the mother, caused by dioxins and PCBs, might negatively influence (early) brain development. It is plausible that the intrauterine dependency on maternal T4 and the high T4 need shortly after birth makes both these periods vulnerable for environmental influences. Effects of dioxin exposure on thyroid hormone metabolism have been described in the period shortly after birth. These effects are no longer found after two years of age indicating a transient effect. In animal studies, in utero exposure has led to effects on brain development due to abnormal induction of liver enzymes. This induction resulted in lower testosterone and estrogen levels, interfering with brain development in the vulnerable period of language development and the development of visuo-spatial abilities. In humans this developmental period occurs around the thirtieth week of pregnancy. Follow-up studies in puberty and adolescence of the different cohorts studied is necessary to evaluate these negative influences. Damaging effects on the liver found shortly after birth have proven to be transient. Effects on the haematopoietic system are clear immediately after birth, for instance on white blood cells and thrombocytes. An increase in middle ear infections (otitis media) in relation to current levels of PCBs at the age of 4 years was described in the Rotterdam study. Negative effects on lung function in the sense of increased obstruction was found after 8 years in relation to perinatal exposure to dioxins in the Zaandam study. This rather new finding might explain the sharp increase in lung problems in children in the Western world. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is part of neurocutaneous diseases, which affect both neurological and cutaneous systems. The most common neurological complications of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) in childhood are learning disabilities (LD) which occur in 40-60% of affected subjects. Despite this high frequency, many aspects of LD and psychological development are still not well defined. The aim of this work is to investigate the general cognitive profile (IQ), the language, memory, attention, skills of visual-spatial, the behavior and the psychological problems of children (4-14 years) affected with NF1 and their first degree relatives enrolled in a regional registry of neurofibromatosis in Northern East Italy. Excluded from the study are children with mental retardation (IQ ± 70) or major central nervous anomalies. Study sample included 25 NF1 children (mean age 7 years and 9 months), their parents and 11 unaffected sibs (mean 8 years end 7 months). The tests used for NF1 subjects and their unaffected sibs (control group) are the following: - IQ: Wechsler Scales: WPPSI and WISC-R - Memory: Rey Complexe Figure (A and B), Digit Span of WISC-R - Visual-Spatial: Bender Test, JLO (Judgment of Line Orientation) - Behavior and Psychological: CDI (Children Depression Inventory). The tests applied to their parents are: - IQ: Wechsler Scale: WAIS - Memory: Rey Complexe Figure (A), Digit Span of WAIS - Visual-Spatial: JLO (Judgment of Line Orientation) - Behavior and Psychological: PIC (Personality Inventory of Children), STAI-Y (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and the questionary about LD In our study the mean of the full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) is normal in NF1 children. No association was found between IQ and clinical severity or the presence of areas of increased signal intensity on T2 weighted images (UBO's or Unidentified Bright Objects). Visual-spatial abilities and memory had a weaker score than other competences. Personality inventories showed a normal cognitive and behavioral profile. Depressive traits were not found in children with NF1. Their parents did not show any trace of anxiety.	ASK	1	0	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		1	3	0	1	1	0	0	1

Recent studies showed, however, that this “view-dependency” can be reduced or even completely eliminated when novel views result from observer's movements instead of object movements. This observer movement benefit was previously attributed to extra-retinal (physical motion) cues. In two experiments, we demonstrate that dynamic visual information (that would normally accompany observer's movements) can provide a similar benefit and thus a potential alternative explanation. Participants performed sequential matching tasks for Shepard–Metzler-like objects presented via head-mounted display. As predicted by the literature, object recognition performance improved when view changes (45° or 90°) resulted from active observer movements around the object instead of object movements. Unexpectedly, however, merely providing dynamic visual information depicting the viewpoint change showed an equal benefit, despite the lack of any extra-retinal/physical self-motion cues. Moreover, visually simulated rotations of the table and hidden target object (table movement condition) yielded similar performance benefits as simulated viewpoint changes (scene movement condition). These findings challenge the prevailing notion that extra-retinal (physical motion) cues are required for facilitating object recognition from novel viewpoints, and highlight the importance of dynamic visual cues, which have previously received little attention.

Undergraduates participated in repeated testing on the MRT or played the videogame Tetris. Analyses showed large improvements in mental rotation with both repeated testing and training; these gains were maintained several months later. MRT scores of men and women did not converge, but men showed faster initial growth and women showed more improvement later. Videogame training showed greater initial growth than repeated testing alone, but final performance did not differ. Effects of videogame training transferred to other spatial tasks exceeding the effects of repeated testing, and this transfer advantage was still evident after several months.

It describes a particular cognitive dimension, and then describes how this dimension appears to operate in the two groups of children in schools, Hawaiian and Navajo, offering a brief description of the relevant dimensions of the cultures that appears to under-grid the cognitive organizations. McShane and Plas’ results of comparative testing again demonstrated that Native Americans’ cognitive patterns include spatial abilities that are better developed than sequencing skills, and that are superior to conceptual and acquired knowledge performances. Native Hawaiians tend toward wholistic thinking as compared with Euro-Americans; Native Indians are far more wholistic in cognition than either. The enlightened goal of education should be to produce a cognitive pluralism that allow, within each society and each individual, the coordinated use of differing processes to solve the demanding task of coping with contemporary pluralistic society. © 2014 Patricia M.

A key challenge for researchers has been participant "buy-in" and attrition for designs requiring repeated testing. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and assess the utility of 1-2 minute versions of both classic and novel cognitive tasks using a user-focused and user-driven mobile phone and tablet app designed to encourage repeated play. Methods: A large sample of app users (N=13,979 at first data collection) participated in multiple, self-paced sessions of classic working memory (N-back), spatial cognition (mental rotation), sustained attentional focus (persistent vigilance task), and split attention (multiple object tracking) tasks, along with the implementation of a comparatively novel action-learning task. The "OU Brainwave" app was designed to measure time-of-day variation in cognitive performance and did not offer any training program or promise any cognitive enhancement. To record participants' chronotype, a full Morningness-Eveningness questionnaire was also included, which measures whether a person's circadian rhythm produces peak alertness in the morning, in the evening, or in between. Data were collected during an 18-month period. While the app prompted re-engagement at set intervals, participants were free to complete each task as many times as they wished. Results: We found a significant relationship between morningness and age (r=.298, n=12,755, P<.001), with no effect of gender (t13,539=-1.036, P=.30). We report good task adherence, with ∼4000 participants repeatedly playing each game >4 times each-our minimum engagement level for analysis. Repeated plays of these games allowed us to replicate commonly reported gender effects in gamified spatial cognition (F1,4216=154.861, P<.001, η2 ρ=.035), split attention (F1,4185=11.047, P=.001, η2 ρ=.003), and sustained attentional focus (F1,4238=15.993, P<.001, η2 ρ=.004) tasks. We also report evidence of a small gender effect in an action-learning task (F1,3988=90.59, P<.001, η2 ρ=.022). Finally, we found a strong negative effect of self-reported age on performance, when controlling for number of plays, in sustained attentional focus (n=1596, F6,1595=30.23, P<.001, η2=.102), working memory (n=1627, F6,1626=19.78, P<.001, η2=.068), spatial cognition (n=1640, F6,1639=23.74, P<.001, η2=.080), and split attention tasks (n=1616, F6,1615=2.48, P=.02, η2=.009). Conclusions: Using extremely short testing periods and permitting participants to decide their level of engagement-both in terms of which gamified task they played and how many sessions they completed-we were able to collect a substantial and valid dataset. We suggest that the success of OU Brainwave should inform future research oriented apps-particularly in issues of balancing participant engagement with data fidelity. © 2020 International Association of Online Engineering.

Observational measures of videotaped father–child interactions from the Boston site of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 105) were used to examine the effectiveness of spatial support during a block building task. Trained observers rated fathers’ spatial support by applying two approaches: (a) a qualitative rating scale assessing level of paternal spatial concept support involving encouragement of child spatial learning and enriched spatial explanations, and (b) a measure assessing quantitative paternal spatial location language support. A significant sex by quality of spatial concept support interaction showed that for girls (but not for boys), fathers’ qualitatively higher spatial concept support predicted superior math achievement scores by the end of first grade, even after controlling for a host of variables, including children's math achievement at age 4.5 years, family income, child intelligence and ratings of fathers’ and mothers’ general cognitive support (e.g., support for a range of perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic development) across all parent–child activities during the first grade home visit. The quantitative measure of frequency of paternal spatial location language support was not predictive of math, but children's independent accuracy on the block building task did predict math achievement. Though only correlational, findings suggest that fathers may have an important role to play in providing high-quality spatial concept support for their young daughters. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

JMIR formative research	https://doi.org/10.2196/29873	BACKGROUND: Additional interventions are needed for survivors of psychological trauma because of several barriers to and limitations of existing treatment options  (eg, need to talk about the trauma in detail). Case studies are an important step in  exploring the development of novel interventions, allowing detailed examination of  individual responses to treatment over time. Here, we present a case study that aims  to test a novel intervention designed to disrupt memory reconsolidation, taking a  single-symptom approach by focusing on intrusive memories of a traumatic event.  OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine a novel brief cognitive intervention to reduce  the number of intrusive memories of trauma in an Icelandic setting and to extend  previous studies by examining long-term effects for up to 3 months. The intervention  was guided by a clinical psychologist and comprised a brief memory reminder,  followed by Tetris gameplay with mental rotation, targeting one memory at a time in  each session. METHODS: This was a single case study in Iceland with a woman in her  50s (drawn from an epidemiological study of trauma) with subthreshold posttraumatic  stress disorder and a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder and social anxiety  disorder. The participant had four different intrusive memories from a traumatic  event that happened in her childhood. The primary outcome was the change in the  number of intrusive memories from baseline to intervention phase and to follow-ups.  The number of intrusions was monitored in a daily diary for 4 weeks preintervention,  8 weeks during the intervention, and 1 week at 1-month and 3-month follow-ups.  Intrusions were targeted one by one over six intervention sessions, creating four  repetitions of an AB design (ie, length of baseline A and intervention phase B  varied for each memory). We examined changes in both the total number of intrusions  (summed across all four memories) and individually for each memory. In addition, we  explored whether having fewer intrusive memories would have an impact on  functioning, posttraumatic stress, and depression or anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: The  total number of intrusions per week was 12.6 at baseline, 6.1 at the intervention  phase (52% reduction from baseline), 3.0 at the 1-month follow-up (76% reduction),  and 1.0 at the 3-month follow-up (92% reduction). Reductions in the symptoms of  posttraumatic stress and depression were observed postintervention. Sleep,  concentration, stress, and functioning improved. The participant considered the  gameplay intervention acceptable and helpful in that she found that the memories  disappeared while she was playing. CONCLUSIONS: This guided brief cognitive  intervention reduced the number of intrusive memories over the intervention phase  and follow-ups. The brief memory reminder was well tolerated, removing the need to  discuss trauma in detail. The next steps require an extension to more cases and  exploring remote delivery of the intervention.

G.	1974	thesis	The construction of the plan of a house test and an investigation into some of its developmental and clinical implications in children		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/construction-plan-house-test-investigation-into/docview/1790897494/se-2?accountid=11531	A chance finding revealed that a boy with no measurable spatial ability and a history of possible neurological trauma could not draw a plan of his house. As emotionally disturbed children were also inferior in the task, it was hypothesized that they too might have some neurological dysfunction. A test of drawing a plan of a house was constructed as a means of testing this hypothesis.    In the course of the item selection, developmental features were noticed, which suggested that children’s skill in plan drawing was associated with the growing awareness of projective and euclidian space as elucidated by Piaget. Problems in comprehending walls as divisions of a total space were probably not particular to this 3D space, but could also be found in 2D space.    A sex difference in favour of the boys was a constant finding, but when the effects of experience and teaching were explored, the earlier supposition of an innate and possibly neurological difference was modified, and one mediated by personality variables seemed to fit the facts more appropriately.    Introspection as to the nature of the task suggested that spatial ability might be involved, but a factor analysis, using the scores of clinic children, revealed that the Plan test loaded also on verbal and visuomotor factors. The extent to which this result can be generalized to normal and older populations is limited by the samples psychiatric disorder, its young age and inadequacies of the battery of tests forming the factor structure.    Contrary to expectations and to findings on other visuo-motor tests, hemiplegic children did not show a specific disability on this test, nor was there any support for the hypothesis that children with left hemisphere damage would score higher than those with right hemisphere damage.    Clinic children with reactive and neurotic disorders scored lower on the test than non-clinic children. There was also some association with neuroticism on the NMP1, but not with the Rutter or Rotter scales of maladjustment.    As a test it was reliable and the results were not influenced by previous experience or teaching, except those of a few individual girls. Concurrent and construct validity with emotional disturbance was established.    The initial hypothesis that this test might reveal a disability common to children with a psychiatric disorder and to those with neurological dysfunctions was not supported.

According to the embodied cognition theory, understanding people’s mental states needs to be supported by and thus is naturally linked to visual perspective taking (VPT) skills, which may benefit from spatial training. The present study tested these associations and examined how VPT might mediate the effect of spatial ability on ToM in young children. Block building activities were the basis of the spatial skills training. Two studies were conducted with preschool children aged 3.5 to 4 years. Study 1 (n = 68) investigated the relationship between spatial ability and ToM and tested whether VPT was a mechanism mediating this relationship; Study 2 (n = 70) tested the effect of training in spatial ability on ToM, and the maintenance of this training effect over a period of 3 months. Analyses in both studies controlled for relevant demographic variables. Results of these two studies indicated that spatial ability was correlated with ToM with VPT mediating this relationship. In addition, the acquisition of spatial ability facilitated the development of ToM, and the intervention effects were still apparent at 3 months. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of ToM development and open a new avenue for future ToM training studies.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Study 1 demonstrated such  mediation correlationally in seventy 3.5- to 4-year olds. In Study 2, twenty-three  3.5- to 4-year-olds were trained on using play blocks to copy preassembled models as  a way to promote spatial ability. Resultant increases in VPT and ToM were compared  to those from a control group learning to draw instead (n = 23). Both studies showed  that the effect of spatial ability on ToM depended on VPT, suggesting a role of  embodiment in ToM development in early childhood. These findings provide an  alternative way to think about ToM development and the psychological mechanism that  may be involved.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Neurotoxicology and teratology	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0892-0362(01)00141-6	The present study compared the cognitive and behavioral functioning of 3- to 7-year-old children (n=33) whose mothers worked with organic solvents during  pregnancy with a group of unexposed children (n=28) matched on age, gender, parental  socioeconomic status (SES), and ethnicity. Participants were recruited prospectively  by the Motherisk Program, an antenatal counseling service in Canada. An exposure  index was estimated using questionnaire data obtained at the time of initial  contact. Groups were compared on a variety of tasks, including subtests from the  NEPSY, a visual CPT, as well as on parent-rated measures of children's behavior.  Regression analyses indicated lower composite scores in children with increased  exposure on Receptive language (P<.01), Expressive language (P<.01), and Graphomotor  ability (P=.001), adjusted for demographics. No group differences were observed on  measures of Attention (P=.97), Visuo-spatial ability (P=.33), and Fine-motor ability  (P=.33). On the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), overall mean differences on broad-  and narrow-band scales were not significant, but significantly more exposed children  were rated as having mild or severe problem behaviors. The findings suggest that  maternal occupational exposure to organic solvents during pregnancy is associated  with poorer outcome in selective aspects of cognitive and neuromotor functioning in  offspring.

Learning and Individual Differences	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2010.04.003	The influence of gender beliefs on cognitive task performance has been demonstrated repeatedly for adults. For children, there is evidence that gender beliefs can substantially impede or boost math performance - a task where gender differences in favour of boys declined over past decades. Therefore, we examined this phenomenon using the Mental Rotations Test (MRT), a task where gender differences still occur reliably favouring males - for adults as well as for children. A sample of 252 fourth graders, whose beliefs about spatial ability were manipulated experimentally (instructions given: boys are better, girls are better or independent of gender) had to complete the MRT. In contrast to adult's literature, children's performance did not decrease or increase as a function of instruction: boys always outperformed girls; girls not even outperformed their same-sex counterparts given the "girls better" instruction.

Therefore, this study investigated whether there is a "crucial" time slot on infantile development when a gender effect is detectable. Following Johnson and Meade's (1987) hypothesis that age ten might be crucial, we investigated 96 fourth graders-split into two age groups (mean: 9.3 vs. 10.3 years)-and 48 adults that performed the MRT (Peters et al., 1995). We observed large gender effects in older children as well as in adults. However, the younger children did not reveal a significant gender effect, although effect sizes indicated a small-to- medium effect. Surprisingly, the performance of women, older girls, and younger girls did not differ significantly, whereas older boys and adults clearly outperformed younger boys. Possible reasons for these effects are discussed. © 2009 Psychology Press.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The presence of learning difficulty is reported in the majority of individuals with 22q11DS, but there is considerable heterogeneity in cognitive and educational profiles and in the age-related changes. Method: Verbal, non-verbal and spatial abilities, and educational attainment of 18 children and adolescents with 22q11DS were assessed at two time points 5 years apart. Results: There was a decline in full-scale IQ, with a sharper decline in verbal than non-verbal skills, whereas spatial abilities remained stable over time. Individual profile analysis revealed discrepancies between full-scale IQ and reading skills, suggestive of “hyperlexia,” for more than two-thirds of participants. Conclusions: The relative strength in verbal ability observed in 22q11DS is more apparent when children are younger, and a more even cognitive profile is observed in older children and adolescents. Educational attainments keep pace with development, and literacy skills are globally higher than might be expected from full-scale IQ. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Relationships between gender and math scores were also examined. Findings indicate no main effect of time spent playing, spatial content, or level of complexity of games on math performance. However, several math scores interacted with time spent playing one's favorite video game, such that higher levels of math performance occurred when participants played games high in spatial content at low amounts of time. A similar interaction occurred when examining complexity of the game and time spent playing. The study provides preliminary evidence that it may be important to consider the spatial or complexity content of videogames in addition to time spent playing when addressing the relationship between videogame play and adolescent math performance.

Personality & social psychology bulletin	https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167203254611	The current study examined on-line behavior recategorization as a mechanism underlying corrections for contextual influences in dispositional inferences. After  watching an initial comparison video that portrayed either a successful or  unsuccessful performance on a spatial ability task, cognitive load and no load  participants watched and made real-time ratings of a target performance. The  comparison video was expected to exert a contrastive influence on participants'  automatic impressions of the performance (behavior categorizations) and the child's  intelligence (dispositional inferences). Load participants' on-line and post-video  performance and ability ratings showed this expected effect, as did no load  participants' initial on-line performance ratings. However, no load participants'  later on-line and post-video ratings did not. These findings support the notion that  corrections for contextual influence can occur at the level of behavior  identification as perceivers encode behavioral cues.

This beneficial effect of having a male sibling on spatial ability could be due to in-uterine transmission of testosterone from males to females (the Twin Testosterone Transfer hypothesis, TTT). The present study explored sex differences and the TTT in non-verbal and verbal abilities in a large sample of twins assessed longitudinally at 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 16 years of age. Females scored significantly higher than males on both verbal and non-verbal abilities at ages 2, 3 and 4. Males scored significantly higher than females on verbal ability at ages 10 and 12. The effect sizes of all differences were very small. No sex differences in non-verbal or verbal abilities were found at 7, 9, 14 and 16 years of age. No support for the TTT was found at any age. The findings indicate that the twin testosterone transfer effect occurs only for specific cognitive abilities, such as mental rotation. © 2017 The Authors	ASK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		SK	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	uploaded to include folder	5	7	0	5	5	0	1	0

Preterm children, who have not been diagnosed with neurological or cognitive deficits, enter normal schools and are expected to succeed as their term-born peers. Here we tested the hypotheses that despite an uneventful development after preterm birth, these children might exhibit subtle abnormalities in brain function and white-matter microstructure at school-age. We recruited 7.5-year-old children born extremely prematurely (<28 weeks’ gestation), and age- and gender-matched term-born controls (≥37 weeks’ gestation). We applied fMRI during working-memory (WM) tasks, and investigated white-matter microstructure with diffusion tensor imaging. Compared with controls, preterm-born children performed WM tasks less accurately, had reduced activation in several right prefrontal areas, and weaker deactivation of right temporal lobe areas. The weaker prefrontal activation correlated with poorer WM performance. Preterm-born children had higher fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower diffusivity than controls in several white-matter areas, and in the posterior cerebellum, the higher FA associated with poorer visuospatial test scores. In controls, higher FA and lower diffusivity correlated with faster WM performance. Together these findings demonstrate weaker WM-related brain activations and altered white matter microstructure in children born extremely preterm, who had normal global cognitive ability. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to replicate this finding and to then investigate the relevance of the specific hemispheres in these deficits. Nine patients with unilateral lesions (five in the Left Hemisphere and four in the Right) and 20 control subjects, performed a single task requiring mental rotation of hands, and two tasks requiring mental rotation of external objects. RH patients were impaired in the rotation of external objects, but showed intact performance on the rotation of hands; the opposite pattern was found for LH patients. These results support the view that the LH contributes to the mental rotation of hands, recruiting processes specific to motor preparation, while the RH is specialized for mental rotation of external objects. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Brain injury	https://doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2019.1597163	Objectives: Dorsal-stream functions are vulnerable to early brain injury associated with neonatal encephalopathy (NE) following perinatal asphyxia, even in children not  developing cerebral palsy (CP). Since therapeutic hypothermia (TH) became the  standard treatment for NE, the incidence of CP is reduced but the impact on  dorsal-stream functions is unknown. We aimed to compare dorsal-stream functions in  TH-treated survivors of NE, without CP, with those of matched controls. Methods: We  administered tests of dorsal-stream function to 29 case children aged 6-to-8 years  treated with TH for NE and without CP, and 20 age, sex and social class matched  controls. We used the Conner's Continuous Performance Test (CPT) 2(nd) Edition to  assess attentiveness, based upon Hit Reaction Time (HRT) percentile score and HRT  standard error percentile, the CPT HRT block change measure to assess sustained  attention and the NEPSY-II block construction and arrows tests to assess  visuo-spatial performance and mental rotation. Results: Case children performed  significantly worse than controls on measures of attention and visuo-spatial  function. Conclusions: Children given TH treatment for NE can have subtle attention  difficulties with slower reaction times and reduced visuo-spatial processing. These  findings illustrate the continued vulnerability of dorsal-stream functions following  NE despite the use of TH.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Developmental neurorehabilitation	https://doi.org/10.3109/17518420903087913	PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: As children with acquired brain injuries (ABI) mature to become adolescents they develop a range of previously undetected social and emotional  difficulties, which are commonly associated with executive dysfunctions. The authors  wanted to determine whether visual-spatial performance is subject to age-related  improvement, whether such skills can differentiate between children with ABI and  healthy children and whether visual-spatial performance is a correlate of  socioemotional functioning. RESEARCH DESIGN: The 'Cube analysis' and 'Dot  discrimination' tests from the 'Visual Object Space Perception (VOSP)' battery and  the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were administered for 18  children, 9-15 years, with ABI and compared against 67 'healthy' children. RESULTS:  Cube analysis scores improved significantly at approximately 10 years old in the  control group. The ABI group performed the task significantly poorer than controls.  Analysis indicated that visual discrimination skill did not account for performance  difficulties. Visual-spatial performance was correlated with greater impact of  reported difficulties on the SDQ. CONCLUSIONS: Visual-spatial tests are sensitive in  differentiating between healthy children and children with ABI. Impairment of  visuo-spatial skills may provide an index of psychosocial risk during later teenage  years and adulthood.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

It is unclear whether the haemorrhage, its subsequent treatment, or both are responsible for poor outcome. In a prospective, longitudinal study neurological and cognitive deficits in a consecutive series of patients who underwent neurosurgical clipping after aneurismal subarachnoid haemorrhage was assessed. A wide range of potentially prognostic clinical and surgical factors were recorded, and neuropsychometric assessment was administered at three time points: six weeks, six months and twelve months post-haemorrhage. Finally, patients underwent SPECT scanning twelve months after haemorrhage to ascertain the degree of functional brain damage. The majority of patients made a good neurological recovery. However, group analyses indicated that patients were impaired on many tests in the domains of general intellectual ability, memory, executive function and visuo-spatial ability. Recovery of cognitive function was variable with improvements in many measures of memory, but more stable verbal difficulties. A subgroup of patients was identified that seemed to have made a complete recovery. Further analyses indicated that these patients had higher pre-morbid intellectual abilities, hampering interpretation of the statistics. Also, this subgroup of patients remained impaired on a small number of tests. SPECT scanning established large areas of cortical hypoperfusion that were related to the location of the aneurysm. In addition, an area of subcortical hypoperfusion was found in the whole patient group. Region of interest analysis showed that thalamic hypoperfusion correlated with cognitive function. Regression analyses revealed that thalamic hypoperfusion and neurological and cognitive outcome were related to pre-morbid factors and haemorrhage-related factors. In contrast few treatment-related factors were associated with outcome. A theory relating outcome with the severity of the haemorrhage, the development of subclinical hydrocephalus and global hypoperfusion, is proposed.

Developmental Science	https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12138	Spatial ability predicts performance in mathematics and eventual expertise in science, technology and engineering. Spatial skills have also been shown to rely on neuronal networks partially shared with mathematics. Understanding the nature of this association can inform educational practices and intervention for mathematical underperformance. Using data on two aspects of spatial ability and three domains of mathematical ability from 4174 pairs of 12-year-old twins, we examined the relative genetic and environmental contributions to variation in spatial ability and to its relationship with different aspects of mathematics. Environmental effects explained most of the variation in spatial ability (~70%) and in mathematical ability (~60%) at this age, and the effects were the same for boys and girls. Genetic factors explained about 60% of the observed relationship between spatial ability and mathematics, with a substantial portion of the relationship explained by common environmental influences (26% and 14% by shared and non-shared environments respectively). These findings call for further research aimed at identifying specific environmental mediators of the spatial-mathematics relationship. © 2014 The Authors Developmental Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

The underlying mechanisms of these changes remain unclear. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether and how experimentally induced long-term CKD affects cognitive functions in rats.Thirty male Wistar rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx), an established model of CKD, or sham surgery. Development of CKD was monitored using biochemical analyses and confirmed by renal histology. Behavioral tests of anxiety, depression and spatial behavior were performed before, and at 3 and 9. months after the surgery.CKD in 5/6 Nx rats was characterized by significant decrease of renal function, e.g., glomerular filtration rate, and progressive glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis; and increased plasma uremic toxins. Mortality was higher in 5/6 Nx rats in comparison with controls. Compared to control group, the surviving 5/6 Nx rats presented similar general locomotor activity, depression traits, and spatial abilities ( p= 0.43, p= 0.84, p= 0.71, respectively). At 9. months, lower anxiety in the light-dark box test was observed in 5/6 Nx rats if compared with the control group ( p= 0.02).Despite the development of progressive CKD in 5/6 Nx rats, no expected behavioral changes were observed. Further experimental studies associating behavioral responses to severity of CKD are definitely needed to confirm the solely psychosocial aspect background of CKD-associated cognitive impairment in humans. © 2014.

Experimental brain research	https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-013-3698-7	We examined the link between action planning and motor imagery in 6- and 8-year-old children. Action planning efficiency was assessed with a bar transport task. Motor  imagery and visual imagery abilities were measured using a hand mental rotation task  and a number (i.e., non-body stimuli) mental rotation task, respectively. Overall,  results showed that performance varied with age in all tasks, performance being  progressively refined with development. Importantly, action planning performance was  correlated with motor imagery, whereas no relationship was evident between action  planning and visual imagery at any age. The results showed that the ability to  engage sensorimotor mechanisms when solving a motor imagery task was concomitant  with action planning efficiency. The present work is the first demonstration that  evaluating the consequences of the upcoming action in grasping depends on children's  abilities to mentally simulate the response options to choose the most efficient  grasp.

database	Tracey, Megan	2020	thesis	Increasing Understanding of Complex Biological Concepts : Haptic Learning in a Collaborative, 3d Environment		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/increasing-understanding-complex-biological/docview/2475233021/se-2?accountid=11531	Cell biology is known to be a difficult subject due to its abstract and complex nature. Although concepts of cell biology are integral to the understanding of biology overall, misconceptions in cell biology have been identified across all levels of education. Haptic technology (which enables sensing and manipulating through touch) may offer a method of increasing understanding in complex, abstract and unobservable concepts such as those found in cell biology. The potential beneficial effects of haptics in learning complex biological concepts is supported by Dual Coding Theory (Paivio, 1969), Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1994) and Embodied Cognition (Barsalou, 2008). The development and use of haptic systems in the medical field however has identified fine dexterity and spatial ability as factors that may influence the ability of students to interact with and learn from haptic systems (Shahriari-Rad, 2014). However, spatial ability and fine dexterity have not yet been examined in the use of haptics in the learning of complex biological concepts. This study used mixed methods research to determine whether haptic feedback has a beneficial effect on learning concepts of cell biology, whether fine dexterity or spatial ability has an impact on the ability of students to learn from haptic VR systems and discover which features of haptic interventions may support or not support learning in this topic. A collaborative, 3D virtual reality (VR) learning environment capable of providing haptic feedback was developed allowing students to explore, interact and test hypotheses to further their understanding of cell biology. Sixty-four 12-13-year-old students were allocated to haptic (touch feedback enabled) and non-haptic (touch feedback disabled) conditions. Students worked in pairs to complete tasks designed to facilitate collaborative exploration of a 3D VR model of a cell membrane. This study was the first to compare haptic and non-haptic learning in science with a multi-fingered haptic device, which provided a more intuitive method of manipulation than previous haptic alternatives. Learning gains were measured using a test of cell knowledge administered before, immediately after and 8 months after the activity to determine the effect of haptic feedback on learning. Fine dexterity and spatial ability were also measured to explore any effects of these variables in how students learned from the intervention. Thematic analysis of student interviews was also conducted to gain insight into which features of haptic interventions may support or not support students’ learning in this topic. It was found that students increased their knowledge significantly after the intervention and retained that knowledge for 8 months. Thematic analysis of the interviews identified several key themes suggesting that students enjoyed using the system and expressed a preference for interaction and collaboration in their learning. Students perceived increased understanding of the topic and predicted that they would retain their knowledge, which was consistent with the quantitative results. However, there were no significant differences in knowledge gain between haptic and non-haptic conditions. The thematic analysis identified possible sources of excess cognitive load and indicators of visual dominance which may have affected the influence of haptic feedback on learning in this study. Potential sources of excess extraneous cognitive load include the novelty of the system and difficulties grasping within the model, which have the potential to overload working memory and consequently negate beneficial effects provided by the haptic sense. Evidence for the effects of visual dominance were found, suggesting that the prominence of visual information is a detrimental factor in the use of haptic models. Spatial ability and ‘tweezer’ fine dexterity were not found to significantly affect how students learned from the intervention. However, it was found that those with lower ‘finger’ fine dexterity retained more of their knowledge in the long term. Finger fine dexterity is a factor which had not been previously explored in the use of haptic interventions for cell biology, but findings of this study indicate that further research is required to explore how dexterity may affect how students interact with models using multi-finger haptic systems. This study is unique in its evaluation of a multi-fingered haptic device for the learning of cell biology and investigation into the effects of spatial ability and fine dexterity on how students learn from haptic systems in this topic. The findings of this study indicate that effects of extraneous cognitive load, visual dominance and fine dexterity must be addressed to determine optimal conditions for the use of haptic feedback in the learning of complex biological concepts.

As the age of the students increases, so do the sex-different science achievement scores. Reasons for these sex-related differences in science achievement may be related to three areas: social, educational, and personal.    Data were gathered from 283 Midwestern, suburban, fifth-grade students. Subjects responded to a newly-developed toy-playing inventory, the Tracy Toy and Play Inventory, a modified Bem Sex-Role Inventory, and a standardized spatial ability test. Science achievement scores from the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills--Science were retrieved from students' school records. This correlational study investigated the possible relationships among children's extracurricular toy-playing habits, sex-role orientations, spatial abilities, and science achievement.    Findings indicated that boys had significantly higher spatial skills than girls. No significant differences in spatial ability were found among students with different sex-role orientations. No significant differences in science achievement were found between girls or boys, or among students with the four different sex-role orientations. Students who had high spatial ability also had significantly higher science achievement scores than students with low spatial ability. Femininely-oriented boys who reported low-playing in the two-dimensional, gross-body-movement, and proportional-arrangement toy categories scored significantly higher on the test of science achievement than girls with the same sex-role and toy-playing behavior.    To help promote the development of science achievement and/or spatial ability, increased toy-playing with two-dimensional and gross-body-movement toys may be beneficial for undifferentiated, masculine, and androgynous boys, and for feminine girls. Increased toy-playing with three-dimensional toys may be beneficial for masculine and feminine girls and boys. No toy-playing recommendations can be made for estimated-movement-with-a-target or science-activity toys. Promoting androgyny in girls may provide them with more opportunities for intellectual stimulation and development as they scored well-above the mean on the test of science achievement regardless of their toy-playing behavior.

Whereas there exist a large body of studies on the performance of children, adolescents, and adults, empirical data of the elderly are still missing. Here, we present the results of a large cross-sectional study comprising N = 1704 participants of 4-95 years of age. Analysis of the influence of subjects' age on the performance on eight water-level tasks revealed that the ability to solve the tasks correctly was nonlinearly related to age, increasing for children and adolescents, peaking in participants of middle age, and decreasing for the elderly. Only for two tasks, depicting bottles nearest to a full upside down position, subjects' sex exerted a significant influence on performance, favouring males. However, females of middle and older age also had lower success rates than males to solve the tasks correctly. Some possible causes of the age-associated decline of performance in the elderly are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of motor learning and development	https://doi.org/10.1123/jmld.2016-0044	Folding paper is a seemingly simple act that requires planning, bimanual coordination, and manual strength and control to produce specific forces. Although  paper folding has been used as an assessment tool and as a way to promote spatial  skills, this study represents the first attempt to document when paper folding  emerges across early childhood. Seventy-seven children (ages 18 months to 7 years)  and an adult reference group (24 college-aged adults) completed three pre-specified  folds on a single piece of paper. Dependent variables included whether children  attempted each fold and, if so, the accuracy of each fold. Grip strength, pinch  strength, and developmental level were examined as potential correlates of paper  folding. The results demonstrated that paper folding emerges as early as 27 months  of age but becomes more accurate with age. At least 50% of children between 4 and 5  1/2 years of age completed folds. Additionally, children with more age-appropriate  problem-solving skills attempted more folds, independent of age. These findings  provide a descriptive framework for the ages at which paper folding emerges and  suggest that paper-folding interventions could be implemented at even earlier ages  than what previously has been examined.

In laboratory tasks among undergraduates there is a general male advantage for navigational and mental-rotation tasks, whereas studies find female advantage for remembering item locations in complex arrays and the locations of plant foods. Adaptive explanations of sex differences in these spatial abilities have focused on patterns of differential mate search and routine participation in distinct subsistence behaviors. The few studies to date of spatial ability in nonindustrial populations practicing subsistence lifestyles, or across a wider age range, find inconsistent results. Here we examine sex- and age-based variation in one kind of spatial ability related to navigation, dead-reckoning, among Tsimane forager horticulturalists living in lowland Bolivia. Seventy-three participants (38 male) aged 6–82 years pointed a handheld global positioning system (GPS) unit toward the two nearest communities and the more distant market town. We find no evidence of sex differences in dead reckoning (p = 0.47), nor do we find any evidence of age-related decline in dead-reckoning accuracy (p = 0.28). Participants were significantly more accurate at pointing toward the market town than toward the two nearest villages despite its being significantly farther away than the two nearest communities. Although Tsimane do show sexual dimorphism in foraging tasks, Tsimane women have extensive daily and lifetime travel, and the local environment lacks directional cues that typically enhance male navigation. This study raises the possibility that greater similarity in mobility patterns because of overlapping subsistence strategies and activities may result in convergence of some male and female navigation abilities. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Unilateral or mixed handedness appeared to be stabilized by the age of five years. Patients with established hand lateralization tended to function better in all developmental areas including intelligence, language, and visuospatial abilities. It is a tenable hypothesis that the presence or absence of hand lateralization by age five may be an important predictor of outcome in autism.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	0	1	0	0	0		3	4	0	3	3	0	0	1
database	Tuason, Julie A.	1996	thesis	Gendered landscapes: Women, men, and the spatial transformation of urban parks in the United States, 1850-1920		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/gendered-landscapes-women-men-spatial/docview/304275890/se-2?accountid=11531	In the 1890s, a major shift occurred in the location, design, and use of urban parks in the United States. The earlier type (the large landscape park) was several hundred acres in size and was located at or near the city's edge. It emphasized passive forms of recreation, especially the quiet contemplation of nature. The new type (the small playground park) was only a few acres in size and was located in densely populated neighborhoods within the city. The small playground park was designed for active recreation--equipped with ball fields, gymnasiums, and playgrounds for young children.    This study is based upon the premise that gender issues play an important role in the creation and transformation of the urban landscape. Specifically, it the hypothesis that park-making is not a gender-neutral activity. Three major questions are raised: (1) What contributions did women make to the urban park movement in the United States? (2) What role did prevailing beliefs regarding masculinity and femininity play in the design, location, and use of urban parks? (3) To what extent were changes in the landscape of urban parks linked to broader changes in the social relationship between the sexes?    Although other factors may have influenced the spatial transformation of urban parks in the 1890s, this study finds that it was largely the result of a shift in gender relations that occurred around the turn of the century. Based on a critical reading of historical documents (with emphasis on the city of Chicago), the roots of the small playground park can be traced to women-led initiatives to create safe play spaces for children. The earliest public playgrounds were organized by women who belonged either to social settlements (e.g., Chicago's Hull-House) or to women's civic organizations (e.g., the Chicago Woman's Club). Playground initiatives were part of a larger movement known as "municipal housekeeping"--an urban-reform vehicle through which women challenged the Victorian doctrine of separate spheres, gained a more powerful role in urban affairs, and made a lasting imprint on the landscape of American cities.

Using multiple correlations, the performance of one hundred and thirty-five clinic-referred children on the Arithmetic subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) was examined in relation to performance on Verbal, Spatial and Memory dimensions (as measured by the WISC). In addition, a subtyping procedure was used to examine whether the pattern of Arithmetic performance was related to pattern of cognitive abilities. A replication of the preceeding was undertaken on a sample of three hundred and fifteen school-referred children. The qualitative approach involved analysis of errors made on arithmetic-related tasks by eighteen learning disabled children.    The results indicated that the Verbal and/or Memory dimensions consistently contributed to arithmetic performance although the relative contributions of each varied by sex, age and across samples. Qualitative analysis of the performance of children with severely impaired Verbal and Memory abilities was characterized by errors reflecting impaired recollection of basic facts and faulty acquisition of certain mathematical concepts. Contrary to expectations, the Spatial dimension only contributed to the Wechsler Arithmetic subtest for the second sample.    Pattern of cognitive ability had no relationship to the pattern of Arithmetic performance but level of Verbal and Memory abilities differed in relation to pattern of Arithmetic performance.    It was suggested that Spatial ability is necessary to acquire an appreciation of numeration and serves as a basis for the development of mathematical ability but beyond this basis, the degree to which an individual acquires the ability to abstract plays a role in arithmetic performance. Implications and suggestions for future research are briefly presented.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	can't access and see the age but inferred the age is more	3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In addition, this study was designed to examine the difference of some neurocognitive skills for children with ADHD and their unaffected peers using the WISC-R subtests. Method: WISC-R's subtest and IQ scores, and scores of Kaufman's and Bannatyne's categories of the children who were diagnosed with only ADHD were compared with the same scores of the children in the healthy control group (N= 111) and the ADHD with comorbid group (N= 82). Results: It was found that the subtest scores (vocabulary, comprehension, digit span, picture completion, and block design) of the children with only ADHD and ADHD with comorbidity were significantly lower than the healthy group. In addition, object assembly subtest scores of the children with only ADHD were lower than the control group. Subtests of comprehension (Wald = 5.47, df = 1, p=0.05), digit span (Wald = 16.79, df = 1, p=0.001), and picture completion (Wald= 5.25, df= 1, p=0.05) were able to predict ADHD significantly. In this study, the categories of freedom from distractibility (Wald = 8.22, df = 1, p=0.01) and spatial abilities (Wald = 12.22, df = 1, p<0.0001) were also predictive for ADHD. Conclusion/Discussion: Problem-solving abilities in social processes, auditory short-term memories, visual-spatial abilities, and visual configuration abilities of the children with ADHD were lower than their healthy peers. It was thought that in WISC-R's profile analysis, the categories of freedom from distractibility and spatial abilities could be distinctive in ADHD diagnosis.

Cognitive Development	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2020.100980	There is a consensus that spatial language supports spatial reasoning. However, it remains a question of how specific spatial terms (e.g., prepositions) relate to distinct spatial skills that are critical for spatial cognition (e.g., mental transformation). We asked whether 1) preschoolers’ spatial language skills, particularly knowledge of postpositions, were linked to their mental transformation abilities, and 2) other cognitive factors such as reasoning about relations were associated with this link. Turkish-speaking preschool-aged children (Mage = 53 months) completed spatial language (i.e., postposition comprehension and production), spatial reasoning (i.e., mental transformation), relational reasoning, cognitive inhibition, and general vocabulary knowledge tasks. Results showed that older children performed better on all tasks, except the relational reasoning one. Children's mental transformation performance was associated with their postposition knowledge and relational reasoning performance, beyond general vocabulary knowledge and cognitive inhibition. These findings present evidence on the link between spatial language and spatial reasoning from Turkish-learning preschool-aged children and emphasize the role of other cognitive factors such as relational reasoning on mental transformation. © 2020	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	mean age is 53 months >> 36 months	3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Mutation location in the dystrophin gene, have been associated with neuropsychological functioning in DMD. Purpose: We investigated temporal changes in the neuropsychological functioning of DMD subjects, hitherto understudied. Methods: Subjects with suspected DMD were enrolled according to the ethical guidelines. Genetic confirmation by Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification was carried out to identify pathogenic deletion or duplication in dystrophin gene. Intellectual and neuropsychological functioning was assessed by using standardized batteries. Investigated neuropsychological domains included visual, verbal and working memory, selective and sustained attention, executive functioning, verbal fluency, and visuo-constructive and visuo-spatial abilities. The assessments were carried out at baseline and followed for one time point in 30 cases. Result: The follow-up assessment revealed that neuropsychological functioning did not worsen with time. Improvements were seen in block designing task (p = 0.050), serial positioning primacy effect (p = 0.002), Stroop incongruent task (p = 0.006), visual long-term memory (p = 0.003) and attention (p = 0.001). DMD cases with mutation location affecting short dystrophin isoform (Dp140) also showed improvement in these domains. Conclusion: No temporal alterations were found in DMD subjects, though improvements in few domains were observed. Neuropsychological rehabilitation may be useful in improving the quality of life in DMD subjects. © 2020 Indian Academy of Neurosciences (IAN).	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The experimental group received a program aimed at improving  representation and transformation of visuospatial information, whereas the control  group received a substitute program. All children were administered mental rotation  tests before and after an intervention program and a Global-Local Processing  Strategies test before the intervention. The results revealed that initial gender  differences in spatial ability disappeared following treatment in the experimental  but not in the control group. Gender differences were moderated by strategies used  to process visuospatial information. Intervention and processing strategies were  essential in reducing gender differences in spatial abilities.

Each subject was asked to make a decision regarding the side on which a stick figure stimulus held a ball. Regression analyses were used to compare reaction time and accuracy scores among the groups. As predicted, reaction time scores from fastest to slowest were displayed by groups in the following order: control < LD < DS. Although control and LD subjects were more accurate in mental rotation performance than DS subjects, the control subjects were only marginally better than the LD subjects (p < 06). Mental rotation presentations were further broken down into upright and rotated categories. The control group had quicker reaction times than the LD group in both of these categories. In accuracy analyses, the control group and the LD group performed similarly at the upright angles. However, at rotated angles there was a trend for the control group to be more accurate than the LD group (p <. 07). LD individuals surpassed DS individuals’ performance at upright angles but not at rotated angles. We concluded that although LD children performed mental rotation problems more slowly than normal children, they were not necessarily less accurate. Further- • more, our data indicated that LD subjects had difficulties comparable to those of DS individuals on spatial transformation problems. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Mental rotation and dichotic listening tasks were administered to three groups of children: control (C), learning disabled (LD), and Down syndrome (DS). Significant differences were found in reaction time and accuracy measures in mental rotation. Although the DS group lacked a systematic reaction time function, all three groups produced similar accuracy functions: each group appeared to demonstrate difficulty at equivalent angular disorientations. Dichotic listening resulted in performance differences only when the DS group was compared to the C and LD groups: discrepant language processing was not demonstrated between the C and LD groups. Conclusions could not be reached regarding the impact of language lateralization on spatial task performance. Inconsistencies of neuropsychological measurements are discussed; the topic of mental rotation is explored in depth. Generalizations regarding performance outcomes are limited to a behavioral level.

Many studies have found a correlation between STEM skills and spatial ability. A meta-analysis of studies (as reported by Hawes et al. (in Davis (ed), Spatial reasoning in the early years: Principles, assertions, and speculations, Routledge, New York, 2015) reported that interventions to teach spatial skills resulted in significant improvement, approximately doubling the number of people with spatial skills associated with being an engineer. Most educational programs lack a focus on spatial skills, especially in early years when children are developing their spatial sense of the world and building a foundation for later, more complex, spatial skills. Little research exists showing what young children do when allowed to explore materials with little or no adult direction. This qualitative study was designed to address that gap and provide evidence of spatial skills in young children, specifically toddlers (12–36 months old). A variety of common household materials were set out during free play time, and educators provided minimal guidance while children played. Trained videographers recorded for 10 h (twice a week for 1 h over a 5-week period). Video was open coded for spatial actions children displayed with the materials. The initial codes were then reviewed for common themes and compared to those found in previous studies. Results show that toddlers demonstrated a wide range of spatial skills without educator direction and stayed engaged for long periods of time. Based on these results, implications are presented for educators to support spatial development. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.	ASK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		5	5	1	NA	5	0	0	1

In Expt 1 the subjects named a simple line drawing, and in Expt 2 they named a word appearing in a rectangle. The distracting word (i) was a semantic associate of the target stimulus, (ii) was graphemically similar to the name of the target, (iii) was phonemically similar to the name of the target, (iv) was unrelated in meaning, orthography and phonology, or (v) was replaced with an unpronounceable letter string. Three groups of subjects were tested. Skilled adult readers were compared with two groups of children. Matched groups of children were used, with similar ages (9–12 years old) and non‐verbal spatial abilities, but dissimilar reading ages. All groups of subjects showed semantic interference and graphemic priming from the distractor word in Expt 1, and the children showed phonemic priming. In Expt 2, only the poor readers showed semantic interference, and no groups showed graphemic or phonemic effects. 1984 The British Psychological Society	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Perception	https://doi.org/10.1068/p240891	Mental rotation tasks have been used to probe the mental imagery both of sighted and of visually impaired people. People who have been blind since birth display a  response pattern which is qualitatively similar to that of sighted people but tend  to respond more slowly or with a higher error rate. It has been suggested that  visually impaired people code the stimulus and its (or their own) motion in a  different way from sighted people-in particular, congenitally blind people may  ignore the external reference framework provided by the stimulus and surrounding  objects, and instead use body-centred or movement-based coding systems. What has not  been considered before is the relationship between different strategies for  tactually exploring the stimulus and the response pattern of congenitally blind  participants. Congenitally blind and partially sighted children were tested for  their ability to learn and recall a layout of tactile symbols. Children explored  layouts of one, three, or five shapes which they then attempted to reproduce. On  half the trials there was a short pause between exploring and reproducing the  layouts. In an aligned condition children reproduced the array from the same  position at which they had explored it; in a rotated condition children were asked  to move 90 degrees round the table between exploring and reproducing the layout.  Both congenitally blind and partially sighted children were less accurate in the  rotated condition than in the aligned condition. Five distinct strategies used by  the children in learning the layout were identified. These strategies interacted  with both visual status and age. We suggest that the use of strategies, rather than  visual status or chronological age, accounts for differences in performances between  children.

In this research the cognitive and executive functions of non-institutionalized Colombian school children with CD were compared with normal school children, all between 6 and 12 years-old. Materials and methods: We used a case-control design. The cases were participants who met the diagnostic criteria for CD (n=39) and controls who did not meet these criteria (n=39), according to reports of a professional of the participants' institution, and a structured interview for childhood psychiatric syndromes. The two groups were selected from educational institutions, and there were no differences in age, school grade, or socioeconomic level. The IQ was reviewed, as well as the presence of other mental disorders, serious physical illnesses, and more serious neurological signs. The cognitive and executive functions were evaluated using a child neuropsychological test battery. Results We found that participants with CD had significantly lower scores in construction abilities, perceptual abilities (tactile, visual and auditory), differed in verbal memory, differed in visual memory, language (repetition, expression and understanding), meta-linguistic abilities, spatial abilities, visual and auditory attention, conceptual abilities, verbal and graphic fluency, and cognitive flexibility. The same differences were found between males, except in repetition, whereas girls showed fewer differences, thus the cognitive and executive performance was poorer in males with CD than in females, especially in verbal and linguistic-related functions. Conclusions Children with CD could show generalized cognitive and executive deficits. These deficits seem to be more frequent in boys than in girls with CD. © 2013 Asociación Colombiana de Psiquiatría.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This situation led us to investigate and show, through an experimental model, the importance of the psychomotor education in the acquisition of the mathematical skills. Our goal is to foster and support each child's aspiration in achieving better and better results in the field of personal autonomy and in improving his/her motor, social, emotional and cognitive competences. The project: The experimental group and the control group are composed each of 16 children of 6 years of age, 12 boys and 4 girls. Both groups were submitted to tests for motor skills and mathematical knowledge in the beginning and at the end of the project. The difference between the two groups is that the experimental group practiced regular psychomotor activities all through the length of our project. The project started in February and ended in June 2009. During this time, the experimental group practiced psychomotor activities for two hours, twice a week. The control group did not practice any organized (structured) psychomotor activity. The choice of the control group was casual. Results: Our experimental research wanted to demonstrate the importance of the psychomotor learning in the development of mathematical logic skills. Revising the data, we notice the limited improvement registered in the control group and the remarkable improvement reached by the experimental group. The project led all the students of the experimental group to improve both their motor skills and the mathematical ones. The proposed psychomotor activities definitely helped every student to develop and to strengthen his/her visual-spatial skills, key-abilities in calculating, both mentally and in writing. Conclusions: With this experimental project we were able to demonstrate that the psychomotor education has a great influence not only on a proper development of the individual's motor skills, but also on his/her acquisition ofmathematic skills. The "idea" of number is an abstract concept and the ideas about "equal numbers" and "different numbers" are more and more abstract. The ability to perceive the concept of "numerousness" results from - as many other conceptual and logic skills do - from an interaction with the world around us. The concept of "numerousness" can come out as a result of the manipulation of objects through action and movement.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In order to see which component processes differentiated between a group of high standard test performers and a group of low standard test performers, these students were presented with an experimental task (Mumaw. 1981) based on an information processing model. The results were in general very sinilar to the results of adult university students who were tested by Mumaw (1981). Speed differentiation between the present groups was only found for obviously negative ( no response) items and speed variables correlated much lower with standard test performance than error percentages. Errors in positive f>es' response) and negative items were only weakly correlated. This suggests-as is indicated by Mumaw ai least two separate sourccs of processing inefficiency. In positive items Ss who had a low standard test score, performed significantly lower on the items that required maximum search and rotation processes. In negative items (which had the strongest relationship with standard tesi performance) large diflcrcnccs between the two groups were found on the category in which only one element was a mismatch (Neg-I items).

Neuroreport	https://doi.org/10.1097/WNR.0000000000000038	People with developmental dyslexia have been shown to have both behavioral and physiological differences when compared with healthy individuals, specifically when  looking at the parietal cortex. Reading and writing deficits are well documented,  but other cognitive deficits in dyslexia are not as well known. To investigate  spatial deficits in children with developmental dyslexia we used a mental rotation  test with three types of stimuli (letters, animals, and objects that look like  letters) while simultaneously recording electroencephalographs. Behaviorally, it was  found that dyslexic children took more time than nondyslexic children to solve the  'letter' and 'object' stimuli and that the dyslexic children had a slower mental  rotation speed when solving 'letter' stimuli. The electroencephalographic data  demonstrated more negative amplitude modulations for the dyslexic group in the left  hemisphere at the time epochs: 200-300, 600-700, 700-800, 800-900, and 900-1000 ms  and in the right hemisphere for the time epoch 600-700 and 900-100 ms. In addition,  hemispheric group differences were found on the basis of stimuli for the time epoch  600-700 ms in which the processing of letters was lateralized to the left hemisphere  for both groups, but the object stimuli was lateralized to the left for nondyslexic  and to the right for dyslexic children. These differences support the idea that the  behavioral differences found between dyslexic and nondyslexic children may be  because of both differences in the early processing of the stimuli and perhaps in  the mental rotation itself.

Psychoneuroendocrinology	https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4530(94)00076-x	The relative contribution of organizing and activating effects of sex hormones to the establishment of gender differences in behaviour is still unclear. In a group of  35 female-to-male transsexuals and a group of 15 male-to-female transsexuals a large  battery of tests on aggression, sexual motivation and cognitive functioning was  administered twice: shortly before and three months after the start of cross-sex  hormone treatment. The administration of androgens to females was clearly associated  with an increase in aggression proneness, sexual arousability and spatial ability  performance. In contrast, it had a deteriorating effect on verbal fluency tasks. The  effects of cross-sex hormones were just as pronounced in the male-to-female group  upon androgen deprivation: anger and aggression proneness, sexual arousability and  spatial ability decreased, whereas verbal fluency improved. This study offers  evidence that cross-sex hormones directly and quickly affect gender specific  behaviours. If sex-specific organising effects of sex hormones do exist in the  human, they do not prevent these effects of androgen administration to females and  androgen deprivation of males to become manifest.

However, most studies have focused on lexicalized expressions and have only examined performance at one particular point in time, without examining how performance changes over development. The current study examined the comprehension of novel metaphor and metonymy in individuals with ASDs from a large age range, using both a cross-sectional (Experiment 1) and longitudinal design (Experiment 2). Performance in the ASD group was lower compared to typically developing (TD) controls, across all ages. Importantly, the results from Experiments 1 and 2 showed that, although chronological age was not a good predictor for performance of either novel metaphor or metonymy in the cross-sectional design, performance improved when longitudinal data was considered. Correlations between vocabulary knowledge, visuo-spatial abilities and figurative language comprehension abilities were also explored. © 2018 Van Herwegen and Rundblad.

Method: PubMed, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and ERIC were searched for studies reporting on executive functions in children born preterm/low birthweight and term controls born in 1990 and later, assessed at a mean age of 4 years or higher. Studies were included if five or more studies reported on the same executive function measures. Results: Thirty-five studies (3360 children born preterm/low birthweight, 2812 controls) were included. Children born preterm/low birthweight performed 0.5 standardized mean difference (SMD) lower on working memory and cognitive flexibility and 0.4 SMD lower on inhibition. SMDs for these executive functions did not significantly differ from each other. Meta-regression showed that heterogeneity in SMDs for working memory and inhibition could not be explained by study differences in gestational age, sex, age at assessment, or year of birth. Interpretation: Children born preterm/low birthweight since 1990 perform half a SMD below term-born peers on executive function, which does not seem to improve with more recent advances in medical care or with increasing age. What this paper adds: Children born preterm/low birthweight perform below term-born children on core executive functions. Lower gestational age or male sex are not risk factors for poorer executive functions. Executive function difficulties in children born preterm/low birthweight remain stable across childhood. Executive function difficulties are similar for children born recently and children born in earlier eras. © 2019 The Authors.

Aggression and antisocial behavior have also been studied from the perspective of executive functions (EFs), the higher-order cognitive abilities that affect other cognitive processes, such as social cognitive processes. The main goal of the present study is to provide insight into the relation between EFs and SIP in adolescents with severe behavior problems. Because of the hierarchical relation between EFs and SIP, we examined EFs as predictors of SIP. We hypothesized that, first, focused attention predicts encoding and interpretation, second, inhibition predicts interpretation, response generation, evaluation, and selection, and third, working memory predicts response generation and selection. The participants consisted of 94 respondents living in residential facilities aged 12–20 years, all showing behavior problems in the clinical range according to care staff. EFs were assessed using subtests from the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Test battery. Focused attention was measured by the Flanker task, inhibition by the GoNoGo task, and working memory by the Visual Spatial Sequencing task. SIP was measured by video vignettes and a structured interview. The results indicate that positive evaluation of aggressive responses is predicted by impaired inhibition and selection of aggressive responses by a combination of impaired focused attention and inhibition. It is concluded that different components of EFs as higher-order cognitive abilities affect SIP. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2020.04.034	Individuals with sequence-space synesthesia (SSS) perceive sequences like months, days and numbers in certain spatial arrangements. Several cognitive benefits have  been associated with SSS, such as enhanced mental rotation, more vivid visual  imagery and an advantage in spatial processing. The current study aimed to further  investigate these cognitive benefits, focusing on spatial navigation skills, to  explore if their enhanced sensitivity to spatial relations is reflected in enhanced  navigational performance. Synesthetes were distinguished from controls by means of a  questionnaire, a consistency test and drawings. A virtual Morris Water Maze (MWM)  task with two allocentric and two egocentric navigation conditions was used to  assess spatial navigation abilities. For the allocentric tasks, participants had to  use object cues to find a hidden platform and for the egocentric tasks, they had to  use their own position as a reference. Results showed that synesthetes performed  significantly better compared to controls on the allocentric and egocentric tasks  that reflected real life situations more accurately. However, this significant  result was only found for the time taken to find the platform and not for the length  of the path that was taken. In exploratory analyses, no significant relations were  found between task performance and the specific features of the manifestation of  each individual's synesthesia. Our hypothesis that synesthetes with the ability to  mentally rotate their spatial arrangements would perform better on the allocentric  task was not confirmed. Results add to the growing body of literature concerning the  cognitive benefits of SSS and are consistent with the possibility that enhanced  spatial navigation skills emerge from generally enhanced visuospatial abilities in  SSS.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00107	This study evaluates boy-girl differences in 3D mental rotation in schoolchildren aged 7-12 years and the relation to arithmetic performance. A dedicated new task was  developed: The Mental Rotation Task - Children (MRT-C). This task was applied to a  large sample of 729 children. At the age of 7- to 9-years, a sex difference was  found in the number of correct judgments made on the MRT-C. Boys performed better  than girls. A closer look at the distribution of boys and girls in this age group  showed that boys were overrepresented in the top performance quartile, whereas girls  were overrepresented in the lowest performance quartile. A second finding was that  higher mental rotation performance was significantly correlated to better  mathematical achievement. This finding was done for boys, but not for girls. This  correlation underscores the important role that spatial processing plays in  mathematical achievement and has implications for school practice.

Neuropsychologia	https://doi.org/10.1016/s0028-3932(99)00130-x	When bisecting lines, an important number of brain damaged patients tend to place their bisection marks in the hemispace ipsilateral to their lesion. Biases have also  been reported in normal adults. In vertical bisection both patients and normal  subjects present with upward shifts, although a downward displacement may occur  eventually. Surprisingly, little is known on line bisection (LB) in normal or brain  damaged children. A total of 650 subjects, aged 7-12 years, performed a horizontal  and vertical LB task with their preferred hand. Asymmetry indices (AIs) were used to  measure directional bias. Unsigned AIs served to evaluate accuracy and mastery of  the LB skill. In vertical bisection a general and significant upward bias was found,  whereas in horizontal bisection subject (gender, handedness, utilized hand, age) and  stimulus variables (orientation, length, position) yielded significantly different  AIs. Although with increasing age significantly increasing accuracy was observed,  none of the participating children mastered LB to mathematical precision.  Differences in IQ-level and attention test score did not yield significantly  different AIs. Impact from reading proficiency could not be demonstrated. It is  suggested that stimulus length effect results are compatible with the Halligan and  Marshall [Halligan, P., and Marshall, J. Toward a principled explanation of  unilateral neglect. Cognitive Neuropsychology, 1994, 11, 167-206] model of  hemispatial neglect. Moreover, data may support the hypothesis of greater  hemispheric specialization of visuo-spatial skills in boys than in girls.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Molecular psychiatry	https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.mp.4001999	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, combined type (ADHD-CT) is associated with spatial working memory deficits. These deficits are known to be subserved by  dysfunction of neural circuits involving right prefrontal, striatal and parietal  brain regions. This study determines whether decreased right prefrontal, striatal  and parietal activation with a mental rotation task shown in adolescents with  ADHD-CT is also evident in children with ADHD-CT. A cross-sectional study of 12  pre-pubertal, right-handed, 8-12-year-old boys with ADHD-CT and 12 pre-pubertal,  right-handed, performance IQ-matched, 8-12-year-old healthy boys, recruited from  local primary schools, was completed. Participants underwent functional magnetic  resonance imaging while performing a mental rotation task that requires spatial  working memory. The two groups did not differ in their accuracy or response times  for the mental rotation task. The ADHD-CT group showed significantly less activation  in right parieto-occipital areas (cuneus and precuneus, BA 19), the right inferior  parietal lobe (BA 40) and the right caudate nucleus. Our findings with a child  cohort confirm previous reports of right striatal-parietal dysfunction in  adolescents with ADHD-CT. This dysfunction suggests a widespread maturational  deficit that may be developmental stage independent.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

This research examined the presence of this dissociation in children. Participants between 8 and 12 years of age, divided over three age groups (i.e., 65 children from 7.5 to 9 years old, 75 children from 9 to 10.5 years old, and 77 children from 10.5 to 12 years old) performed a battery of object and viewer transformation tasks. Analysis of variance showed that performance improved with age on the individual object and viewer transformation tasks, with the largest effects between 10.5 and 12 years of age. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses to test the dissociation of object and viewer transformation ability over the different age groups revealed that in children under 10.5 years of age object and viewer transformation ability could not be differentiated. A dissociation between object and viewer transformation ability was shown between 10.5 and 12 years of age. This period of specialization of spatial abilities may be a particularly interesting time window for identifying spatial talents and providing spatial training and intervention. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Sex and SES differences are observed in the engagement in such spatial play activities at home, which relate to individual differences in spatial performance. The current study investigated the effects of explicitly providing spatial play activities in the school setting on different types of spatial ability. We presented 8- to 10-year-old children with a short and easy-to-adopt classroom intervention comprising a set of different spatial play materials. The design involved a pretest-posttest comparison between the intervention group (n = 70) and a control group without intervention (n = 70). Effects were examined on object transformation ability (i.e., a paper-and-pencil mental rotation and paper folding task) and viewer transformation ability (i.e., a hands-on 3D spatial perspective-taking task). Results showed specific effects: there were no differences between the intervention and control group in progress on the two object transformation tasks. Substantial improvements were found for the intervention group compared to the control group on the viewer transformation task. Training progress was not related to sex and socioeconomic background of the child. These findings support the value of spatial play in the classroom for the spatial development of children between 8 and 10 years of age.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01114	Sex differences in spatial ability are a seriously debated topic, given the importance of spatial ability for success in the fields of science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and girls' underrepresentation in these domains.  In the current study we investigated the presence of stereotypic gender beliefs on  spatial ability (i.e., "spatial ability is for boys") in 10- and 12-year-old  children. We used both an explicit measure (i.e., a self-report questionnaire) and  an implicit measure (i.e., a child IAT). Results of the explicit measure showed that  both sexes associated spatial ability with boys, with boys holding more male  stereotyped attitudes than girls. On the implicit measure, boys associated spatial  ability with boys, while girls were gender-neutral. In addition, we examined the  effects of gender beliefs on spatial performance, by experimentally activating  gender beliefs within a pretest-instruction-posttest design. We compared three types  of instruction: boys are better, girls are better, and no sex differences. No  effects of these gender belief instructions were found on children's spatial test  performance (i.e., mental rotation and paper folding). The finding that children of  this age already have stereotypic beliefs about the spatial capacities of their own  sex is important, as these beliefs may influence children's choices for spatial  leisure activities and educational tracks in the STEM domain.

Interventions for treating hemispatial neglect may be categorized as either top-down or bottom-up processing. The aim of top-down approaches is to train the person to voluntarily compensate for their neglect. Such approaches require awareness of the disorder and a high level of active participation by the patient. Differently, bottom-up approaches are based on manipulation of a patient’s sensory environment and so require less awareness of behavioral bias. In line with the latter, it is conceivable that elastic therapeutic taping applied to the left neck surface may provide bottom-up inputs that reduce hemispatial neglect symptoms. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of therapeutic neck taping on visuo-spatial abilities, neck motion, and kinesthetic sensibility in chronic stroke patients with hemispatial neglect. Materials and Methods: After randomization, 12 chronic stroke patients with hemispatial neglect received 30 consecutive days of real (treatment group) or sham (control group) neck taping. The outcomes were as follows: Stars Cancellation Test; neck active range of motion; Letter Cancellation Test; Comb and Razor Test; Cervical Joint Position Error Test evaluated before and after one month of taping. Results: Between-group comparison showed significant differences only for the Cervical Joint Position Error Test after treatment (p = 0.009). Conclusions: Our preliminary findings support the hypothesis that neck taping might improve cervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility in chronic stroke patients with hemispatial neglect. Further studies are needed to strengthen our results and better investigate the effects of elastic therapeutic taping on visuo-spatial abilities in stroke patients with hemispatial neglect. © 2019 by the authors.

Evolutionary psychologists have explained these patterns by arguing that an increase in spatial ability facilitated navigation, which allowed range expansion in pursuit of additional mating and hunting opportunities. This study evaluates this hypothesis in a population with navigational demands similar to those that faced many of our ancestors, the Twe and Tjimba of northwestern Namibia. Twe and Tjimba men have larger visiting ranges than women and are more accurate in both spatial (mental rotations) and navigational (accuracy pointing to distant locations) tasks. Men who perform better on the spatial task not only travel farther than other men, but also have children with more women. These findings offer strong support for the relationship between sex differences in spatial ability and ranging behavior, and identify male mating competition as a possible selective pressure shaping this pattern. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the hypothesis argues that estrogens constrain travel during key reproductive periods by depressing women’s spatial-cognitive ability. Limiting travel reduces exposure to the dangers and caloric costs of navigating long distances into unfamiliar environments. Our study evaluates a collection of predictions drawn from the fertility and parental care hypothesis among the Twe and Himba people living in a remote region of Namibia. We find that nursing mothers travel more than women at any other stage of their reproductive career. This challenges the assumption that women limit travel during vulnerable and energetically demanding reproductive periods. In addition, we join previous studies in identifying a relationship between spatial ability and traveling among men, but not women. If spatial ability does not influence travel, hormonally induced changes in spatial ability cannot be used as a mechanism to reduce travel. Instead, it appears the fitness consequences of men’s travel is a more likely target for adaptive explanations of the sex differences in spatial ability, navigation, and range size. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

While a brief version of the Systemizing Quotient (SQ) has been proposed, there is a need to assess its psychometric properties. This study assessed factorial and construct validity of an 8-item version of the SQ on a sample of 627 participants. A single-factor latent variable model with a single correlated error term showed adequate fit in a confirmatory factor analysis. This model also demonstrated metric invariance across genders when controlling for an effect of age on item responses. Reliability was acceptable, α = .72. As further evidence for construct validity, SQ scores showed expected relationships with mental rotation performance, trait anxiety, childhood extroversion, childhood agreeableness, and gender. Overall, the results indicated good psychometric properties for the brief version of the SQ, suggesting that this scale could be useful when researchers require a systemizing measure that is minimally burdensome to complete.

This could in part be due to the lack of age-appropriate and reliable tests. In this study, adult versions of multiple-choice tests measuring three different spatial ability categories were adapted for use with 9-year-old children. Sex differences of 0.6 to 0.8 and 0.4 standard deviation units were found in mental rotation and spatial perception, respectively, indicating that reliable sex differences in spatial ability are present in prepubertal children. A small (0.2) and nonsignificant difference appeared in spatial visualization. These effect sizes and their distribution across categories are similar to meta-analytic results based on adolescent and adult data. Analyses of test intercorrelations showed that the shared variance among tests was higher in boys than in girls, suggesting that spatial ability is a more unified trait in boys as compared to girls, in whom spatial abilities are more heterogeneously organized.

Cognitive function was assessed using three core tests from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for children-II edition and additional tests measuring learning, short-term memory, reasoning, verbal and visuo-spatial abilities, attention and concentration. Data on the parents' socioeconomic status, education, occupation and income were collected. Results: According to WHO definitions, 3.5% of the children were overweight/obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) >+1SD) and 27% underweight (BMI<-2SD). Compared to normal children, overweight/obese children scored higher in tests of learning/long-term retrieval, reasoning and verbal ability (unadjusted p<0.05 for all). All the Cognitive Test scores increased with increase in BMI and skinfold thickness, (unadjusted β=0.10-0.20 SD; p<0.05 for all). The effects, though attenuated, remained mainly signi ficant after adjustment for age, sex and socioeconomic factors. Similar associations were found for waist circumference and percentage body fat. Conclusions: In this Indian population, in which obesity was uncommon, greater adiposity predicted higher cognitive ability. These associations were only partly explained by socioeconomic factors. Our findings suggest that better nutrition is associated with better cognitive function, and that inverse associations between adiposity and cognitive function in high-income countries reflect confounding by socioeconomic factors.

Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition	https://doi.org/10.6133/apjcn.032016.07	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Animal studies have demonstrated poor cognitive outcomes in offspring in relation to maternal vitamin D deficiency before and/or during  pregnancy. Human studies linking maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy with  offspring cognitive function are limited. We aimed to test the hypothesis that lower  maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy is associated with poor offspring  cognitive ability in an Indian population. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Cognitive  function was assessed in children from the Mysore Parthenon birth cohort during  childhood (age 9-10 years; n=468) and adolescence (age 13-14 years; n=472) using 3  core tests from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for children and additional tests  measuring learning, long-term retrieval/ storage, short-term memory, reasoning,  verbal fluency, visuo-spatial ability, and attention and concentration. Maternal  serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was measured at 30±2 weeks of gestation.  RESULTS: During pregnancy 320 (68%) women had 'vitamin D deficiency' (serum  25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration <50 nmol/L). Girls scored better than boys in  tests of short-term memory, reasoning, verbal fluency, and attention (p<0.05 for  all). Maternal vitamin D status (low as well as across the entire range) was  unrelated to offspring cognitive function at both ages, either unadjusted or after  adjustment for the child's current age, sex, maternal age, parity, season at the  time of blood sampling, gestational age, the child's birth and current size,  socio-economic status, parents' education, maternal intelligence and home  environment. CONCLUSIONS: In this population, despite a high prevalence of vitamin D  deficiency during pregnancy, there was no evidence of an association between  maternal vitamin D status and offspring cognitive function.

The Journal of nutrition	https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.118075	Folate and vitamin B-12 are essential for normal brain development. Few studies have examined the relationship of maternal folate and vitamin B-12 status during  pregnancy and offspring cognitive function. To test the hypothesis that lower  maternal plasma folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations and higher plasma  homocysteine concentrations during pregnancy are associated with poorer  neurodevelopment, 536 children (aged 9-10 y) from the Mysore Parthenon birth cohort  underwent cognitive function assessment during 2007-2008 using 3 core tests from the  Kaufman Assessment Battery, and additional tests measuring learning, long-term  storage/retrieval, attention and concentration, and visuo-spatial and verbal  abilities. Maternal folate, vitamin B-12, and homocysteine concentrations were  measured at 30 +/- 2 wk gestation. During pregnancy, 4% of mothers had low folate  concentrations (<7 nmol/L), 42.5% had low vitamin B-12 concentrations (<150 pmol/L),  and 3% had hyperhomocysteinemia (>10 micromol/L). The children's cognitive test  scores increased by 0.1-0.2 SD per SD increase across the entire range of maternal  folate concentrations (P < 0.001 for all), with no apparent associations at the  deficiency level. The associations with learning, long-term storage/retrieval,  visuo-spatial ability, attention, and concentration were independent of the parents'  education, socioeconomic status, religion, and the child's sex, age, current size,  and folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations. There were no consistent associations of  maternal vitamin B-12 and homocysteine concentrations with childhood cognitive  performance. In this Indian population, higher maternal folate, but not vitamin  B-12, concentrations during pregnancy predicted better childhood cognitive ability.  It also suggests that, in terms of neurodevelopment, the concentration used to  define folate deficiency may be set too low.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Strict inclusion criteria ensured the unilaterality of the lesion. Fifty-one subjects were included in this study, 28 with right hemiplegia (14 male and 14 female) and 23 with left hemiplegia (15 male and 8 female). These two groups were compared to a control group (15 male and 15 female) who were chosen to match the subjects on age at testing, full scale IQ and socioeconomic status.    Subjects were studied to determine the effects of early unilateral hemispheric lesions on lateralized higher cerebral functions, and compensation due to neuroplasticity in the reorganization of these functions. The influence of potentially interacting variables, such as sex, familial sinistrality, severity of the cerebral lesion and intervention was also investigated.    Right hemiplegic subjects, who have left hemisphere lesions, were found to have significantly prolonged latencies on a test of complex syntactic interpretation (Active - Passive Test) as compared to Controls. They also demonstrated significantly poorer performance on the Object Assembly, Coding tests and the Performance IQ of the WISC-R, as well as the Raven's Progressive Matrices and the Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration (all considered right hemisphere functions) than the Controls. Left hemiplegics generally performed better on verbal tasks, and poorer on visual-spatial tasks than the Controls, but differences were not statistically significant. No main effects for sex, familial sinistrality seizures, therapy or severity of the physical handicap, as measured by the function of the affected hand, could be demonstrated. Neurodevelopmental delay and problems during pregnancy emerged as important predictors of cognitive outcome measures. Birth asphyxia was significantly correlated with seizures.    The left-right maturation gradient of the two hemispheres could be responsible for the unexpected results in the right hemiplegics. Injury to the left hemisphere may result in transfer of language functions to the less mature (more plastic) right hemisphere at the expense of visual-spatial skills. With right-sided lesions, visual-spatial skills are not transferred to the left hemisphere which is more mature and less plastic. Language functions are not affected, and the damage is partially compensated for by right intrahemispheric reorganization. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

A detailed scoring scheme provides insight into early spatial processing and offers information beyond a basic accuracy score. Second, the relation of spatial assembly to early mathematical skills was evaluated. Spatial skill independently predicted a significant amount of the variability in concurrent mathematical performance. Finally, the relation between spatial assembly skill and socioeconomic status (SES), gender, and parent-reported spatial language was examined. While children's performance did not differ by gender, lower SES children were already lagging behind higher SES children in block assembly. Furthermore, lower SES parents reported using significantly fewer spatial words with their children. © 2013 Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

We investigated whether socioeconomic status (SES) influenced children’s processing of shape names and whether differences in processing were predictive of later spatial skills. Three-year-olds (N = 79) with mothers of varying education levels participated in an eye-tracking task that required them to look at named shapes. Lower SES children took longer to fixate target shapes and spent less time looking at them than higher SES children. Gaze variables measured at age 3 were predictive of spatial skills measured at age 5 even though the spatial measures did not require shape-related vocabulary. Early efficiency in the processing of shape names may contribute to the development of a foundation for spatial learning in the preschool years.

Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development	https://doi.org/10.1111/mono.12280	Understanding the development of spatial skills is important for promoting school readiness and improving overall success in STEM (science, technology, engineering,  and mathematics) fields (e.g., Wai, Lubinski, Benbow, & Steiger, 2010). Children use  their spatial skills to understand the world, including visualizing how objects fit  together, and can practice them via spatial assembly activities (e.g., puzzles or  blocks). These skills are incorporated into measures of overall intelligence and  have been linked to success in subjects like mathematics (Mix & Cheng, 2012) and  science (Pallrand & Seeber, 1984; Pribyl & Bodner, 1987). This monograph sought to  answer four questions about early spatial skill development: 1) Can we reliably  measure spatial skills in 3- and 4-year-olds?; 2) Do spatial skills measured at 3  predict spatial skills at age 5?; 3) Do preschool spatial skills predict mathematics  skills at age 5?; and 4) What factors contribute to individual differences in  preschool spatial skills (e.g., SES, gender, fine-motor skills, vocabulary, and  executive function)? Longitudinal data generated from a new spatial skill test for  3-year-old children, called the TOSA (Test of Spatial Assembly), show that it is a  reliable and valid measure of early spatial skills that provides strong prediction  to spatial skills measured with established tests at age 5. New data using this  measure finds links between early spatial skill and mathematics, language, and  executive function skills. Analyses suggest that preschool spatial experiences may  play a central role in children's mathematical skills around the time of school  entry. Executive function skills provide an additional unique contribution to  predicting mathematical performance. In addition, individual differences,  specifically socioeconomic status, are related to spatial and mathematical skill. We  conclude by exploring ways of providing rich early spatial experiences to children.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	chapter of monograph	SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		3	5	0	3	3	0	0	1

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2014.02.012	Early mathematics achievement is highly predictive of later mathematics performance. Here we investigated the influence of executive function (EF) and spatial skills,  two generalizable skills often overlooked in mathematics curricula, on mathematics  performance in preschoolers. Children (N=44) of varying socioeconomic status (SES)  levels were assessed at 3 years of age on a new assessment of spatial skill (Test of  Spatial Assembly, TOSA) and a vocabulary measure (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test,  PPVT). The same children were tested at 4 years of age on the Beery Test of  Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) as well as on measures of EF and mathematics. The  TOSA was created specifically as an assessment for 3-year-olds, allowing the  investigation of links among spatial, EF, and mathematical skills earlier than  previously possible. Results of a hierarchical regression indicate that EF and  spatial skills predict 70% of the variance in mathematics performance without an  explicit math test, EF is an important predictor of math performance as prior  research suggested, and spatial skills uniquely predict 27% of the variance in  mathematics skills. Additional research is needed to understand whether EF is truly  malleable and whether EF and spatial skills may be leveraged to support early  mathematics skills, especially for lower SES children who are already falling behind  in these skill areas by 3 and 4 years of age. These findings indicate that both  skills are part of an important foundation for mathematics performance and may  represent pathways for improving school readiness for mathematics.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01635	Recent studies show that Theory of Mind (ToM) has implications for children's social competences and psychological well-being. Nevertheless, although it is well  documented that children overall take advantage when they have to resolve cognitive  problems together with a partner, whether individual difference in ToM is one of the  mechanisms that could explain cognitive performances produced in social interaction  has received little attention. This study examines to what extent ToM explains  children's spatial performances in a dyadic situation. The sample includes 66 boys  and girls between the ages of 5-9 years, who were tested for their ToM and for their  competence to resolve a Spatial task involving mental rotation and spatial  perspective taking, first individually and then in a dyadic condition. Results  showed, in accordance with previous research, that children performed better on the  Spatial task when they resolved it with a partner. Specifically, children's ToM was  a better predictor of their spatial performances in the dyadic condition than their  age, gender, and spatial performances in the individual setting. The findings are  discussed in terms of the relation between having a conceptual understanding of the  mind and the practical implications of this knowledge for cognitive performances in  social interaction regarding mental rotation and spatial perspective taking.

A specific neuropsychological profile with a dissociation between language (relatively preserved) and visuo-spatial abilities (more seriously impaired) has been hypothesised in these children. Memory abilities of these patients have not been adequately investigated, although they may substantially contribute to better understanding their neuropsychological profile. The present study aimed at investigating verbal and spatial memory in patients with WS (N = 16). Their performance was compared with that of normally developing children on tasks of verbal and spatial span and immediate and delayed recall of verbal and visuoperceptual materials. Memory abilities of WS children appear to be characterised by defective visuo-spatial memory, both in the short-term and long-term domain, and a dissociation between normal short- but deficient long-term verbal learning. Results are interpreted by supporting the thesis that intellectual disability reflects the defective functioning of a complex system in which some cognitive competencies may be disrupted more than others.

Studies from different laboratories, for example, have demonstrated a complex neuropsychological profile in people with Down syndrome (DS), with atypical development in the cognitive and linguistic domains (for a review see Vicari et al., 2004; Vicari, 2006). However, a quite different pattern is often reported in other syndromes such as Williams syndrome (WS). This is another genetic condition, less frequent but equally characterized by MR and typified by a number of severe medical anomalies, such as facial dysmorphology and abnormalities of the cardiovascular system (Bellugi et al., 1999). Differently from DS, WS children often show marked impairment in certain spatial abilities (especially praxic-constructive) and relative preservation of both productive and receptive language, at least concerning the phonological elements (Vicari et al., 2004). Within the neuropsychological approach to MR, the study of memory and learning is particularly relevant. In fact, altered development of the memory function can seriously interfere with adequate maturation of general intellectual abilities, and thus with the possibility of learning and modifying behavior on the basis of experience. This chapter is dedicated to reviewing the neuropsychological literature and recent experimental studies on memory and learning development in people with DS, reporting their memory capacities and deficits. Consistent with a neuropsychological approach, distinct memory profiles can be traced to the characteristics of the DS brain development and architecture. © Cambridge University Press 2011.

Developmental medicine and child neurology	https://doi.org/10.1017/S0012162206000272	This study aimed at investigating the possible dissociation between visual-object and visual-spatial working memory (WM) in individuals with Williams syndrome (WS)  and Down syndrome (DS). Four study groups were included: WS group (10 males, 5  females) with a mean chronological age (CA) of 19 years 8 months (SD 6y 1mo) and a  mean mental age (MA)of 6 years 11 months (SD 1y 5mo); WS comparison group (7 males,  8 females) comprised of typically developing children with a mean CA of 6 years 10  months (SD 10mo) and a mean MA of 6 years 11 months (SD 8mo)matched as a group with  the participants with WS on the basis of mental age; DS group (11 males, 7 females)  with a mean CA of 15 years 10 months (SD 5y 8mo) and a mean MA of 5 years 2 months  (SD 8mo); and DS comparison group (10 males, 8 females) with a mean CA of 5 years  and 1 month (SD 7mo)and a mean MA of 5 years 2 months (SD 8mo) selected to match the  DS group on the basis of mental age. They were all administered tests that explored  visual perception (Visual Perception Test - Subtest 4 and Line Orientation tests),  visual imagery (imaging the colour of objects and the tail length of well-known  animals), spatial imagery (mental rotation of visually presented or verbally evoked  objects), and WM for visual-object and visual-spatial information. Individuals with  WS exhibited specific difficulties in the visual-spatial, but not the visual-object,  WM task. Instead, people with DS showed reduced performance in both tests. However,  whereas the observed deficit in individuals with DS persisted when perceptual  abilities were taken into account, the deficit in individuals with DS was  compensated when their scores were adjusted for performance on perceptual tasks.  These results support the hypothesis of a dissociation within the sketch-pad slave  system in the WM model and reinforce the view of intellectual disability as a  non-unitary condition.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00490	Spatial navigation is an adaptive skill that involves determining the route to a particular goal or location, and then traveling that path. A major component of  spatial navigation is spatial reorientation, or the ability to reestablish a sense  of direction after being disoriented. The hippocampus is known to be critical for  navigating, and has more recently been implicated in reorienting in adults, but  relatively little is known about the development of the hippocampus in relation to  these large-scale spatial abilities in children. It has been established that,  compared to school-aged children, preschool children tend to perform poorly on  certain spatial reorientation tasks, suggesting that their hippocampi may not be  mature enough to process the demands of such a task. Currently, common techniques  used to examine underlying brain activity, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are not suitable for examining  hippocampal development in young children. In the present paper, we argue instead  for the use of eyeblink conditioning (EBC), a relatively under-utilized,  inexpensive, and safe method that is easy to implement in developing populations. In  addition, EBC has a well defined neural circuitry, which includes the hippocampus,  making it an ideal tool to indirectly measure hippocampal functioning in young  children. In this review, we will evaluate the literature on EBC and its relation to  hippocampal development, and discuss the possibility of using EBC as an objective  measure of associative learning in relation to large-scale spatial skills. We  support the use of EBC as a way to indirectly access hippocampal function in typical  and atypical populations in order to characterize the neural substrates associated  with the development of spatial reorientation abilities in early childhood. As such,  EBC is a potential, simple biomarker for success in tasks that require the  hippocampus, including spatial reorientation.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Cognitive research: principles and implications	https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-020-00220-x	BACKGROUND: Anyone who has ever found themselves lost while driving in an unfamiliar neighborhood or forgotten where they parked their car can appreciate the importance  of being able to navigate their environment. Navigation, or wayfinding, is a  large-scale spatial ability that involves keeping track of the relative positions of  objects and features in space, which allows for determining the path to a goal  location. Early experiences shape spatial skill development, and research finds sex  differences in spatial behaviors from preschool through adulthood, with males  consistently outperforming females. The basis for sex differences in spatial  aptitude is still debated, but explanations include differences in childhood spatial  experience, the use of strategies for solving large-scale spatial problems, and  spatial anxiety. The current study seeks to understand childhood wayfinding factors  that may influence sex and individual differences in wayfinding strategies and  wayfinding anxiety in adulthood. METHOD: One hundred fifty-nine undergraduate  psychology students reported their childhood wayfinding experience (i.e., time spent  outside, distance traveled), current use of wayfinding strategies (i.e., route  strategy, orientation strategy), and current wayfinding anxiety and general anxiety  levels. RESULTS: Independent samples t tests revealed that, compared with females,  males reported spending more time outside and traveling farther distances as  children, having less current wayfinding anxiety and route strategy use, and having  more current orientation strategy use. Mediation analyses found that distance  traveled, but not time spent outdoors, during childhood mediated sex differences in  route strategy use and wayfinding anxiety in adults, even when controlling for  general anxiety. Furthermore, when controlling for participant sex and general  anxiety, current wayfinding anxiety mediated the relationship between distance  traveled during childhood and route strategy use in adults. CONCLUSION: The current  findings provide potential environmental explanations for sex and individual  differences in large-scale spatial behaviors, including wayfinding. Specifically,  sex differences in early wayfinding experience may explain why males and females  develop different strategies for navigating and different levels of wayfinding  anxiety. Furthermore, regardless of sex, allowing children to explore and navigate  their outdoor environments away from home may help lessen their fears about  navigating and, in turn, improve the strategies they choose to traverse unfamiliar  territories.

The hemispherotomy (when five years of age) was followed by immediate and persistent disappearance of the seizures and withdrawal of the treatment. The transfer of right hemispheric functions to the left hemisphere occurred very early; the child's development was examined in relation to the restoration of these functions and the age at surgery. The early surgical intervention and the plasticity of the brain - along with an intensive cognitive rehabilitation - seem to be important in determining the favorable global cognitive outcome. Visuo-spatial abilities and multi-modal integration of these functions with memory, attention and language have been the most critical domains and are recently in progress. The rapidity of processing complex tasks is particularly lacking. This seems to be the expression of the defective development of the Central Executive System. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Journal of affective disorders	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2014.01.024	BACKGROUND: Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a depressive disorder characterised by persistent low and/or irritable mood and has been identified as a major risk factor  for developing major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD and DD have been associated with  executive function difficulties of working memory and attention. Little is known  about how executive function networks in the brain are affected in children and  adolescents with MDD and even less in DD. This study used fMRI and two spatial  working memory paradigms to investigate associated brain function in young people  with DD and an age-, gender- and IQ- matched typically developing group. METHODS:  Nineteen male patients with DD (mean age 11.2±1.5 years) diagnosed according to  DSM-IV criteria and 16 typically developing boys (mean age 10.5±1.1 years) performed  a mental rotation and a delay-match to sample (DMTS) task while undergoing fMRI. All  participants were medication-naïve at the time of testing. RESULTS: Compared to  typically developing young people, the DD group showed less activation in left  frontal regions including left ventro- and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (PFC)  during mental rotation. Medial frontal regions including dorsomedial PFC, anterior  cingulate cortex and frontal pole also showed relatively reduced activation. During  the DMTS task patients showed significantly more activation in the right precuneus  and posterior cingulate cortex. LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study with a  small sample limiting the generalizability of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The results  complement previous findings in adults with MDD that have shown differential  activation of left PFC regions during working memory tasks. Additionally, altered  function of cortical midline structures in young patients with DD was identified.  This supports findings in children, adolescents and adults with MDD suggesting that  the pathophysiology of depressive disorders extends to DD as a risk factor for MDD  and exhibits continuity over the lifespan.

Study design: Forty-six subjects aged 3-18 years with cystinosis underwent cognitive testing to determine intelligence, visual-spatial abilities, and visual-motor skills. An age-matched control group (n = 85; age 2-22 years) underwent the same tests. Age at diagnosis and age at initiation of treatment with cysteamine were recorded at the time of testing. Results: Patients with cystinosis treated at or after age 2 years (late-treatment group) scored significantly lower on verbal, performance, and full-scale IQ measures, as well as on a test of visual-spatial skills, compared with patients treated before age 2 years (early-treatment group) and controls. Both groups of subjects with cystinosis demonstrated impaired visual-motor skills compared with controls, with no difference between the early-treatment and late-treatment groups. Conclusion: Early treatment with cysteamine appears to improve intellectual function in patients with nephropathic cystinosis. However, the lack of improvement in visual-motor function with early cysteamine treatment suggests possibly different mechanisms underlying visual-motor performance compared with other areas of cognition in this disorder.

database	Viswanathan, Leela	2007	thesis	Postcolonial planning: The Alternative Planning Group and the transformation of social planning in Toronto at the turn of the 21st century		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/postcolonial-planning-alternative-group/docview/304782355/se-2?accountid=11531	My dissertation is an interdisciplinary critique of social planning at the turn of the twenty-first century in Toronto, Canada.  Postcolonial Planning contributes to the field of urban studies by examining socio-spatial knowledge of cities at the intersection of globalization, multiculturalism, and planning discourses. This is an intimately detailed case study of the Alternative Planning Group (APG), a collective of four social planning organizations among groups of Chinese, continental African, Latino-Hispanic, and South Asian communities in Toronto. My research expands planning scholarship by investigating an approach to planning that is politicized, and that is practiced, experienced, and situated within and among immigrant and racialized groups in Toronto. I argue that the APG's efforts constitute a new approach to planning—what I term "postcolonial planning"—that challenges and attempts to transcend the neoliberal transformation of Toronto, the colonial histories of immigrant groups and legacies imposed upon these groups in the city, federal official multiculturalism policy, and city government diversity management practices.   My dissertation draws from my eight years of personal and professional experience in working with the APG and from my empirical research conducted over a six-month period in 2005. The research includes focused discussions with APG leaders and twenty-five in-depth interviews with individuals who have been engaged in some way with the APG's activities since 1998.   My empirical research identifies three elements to a postcolonial planning in Toronto; these are: (1) planning as collective practice that challenges dominant planning practices; (2) a critical examination of multiculturalism and diversity; and (3) a struggle through contestation and containment for an identity-citizenship connection. I show that Toronto is the location of social-spatial transformation, and immigrants and racialized groups are part of that transformation. This transformation is not simply based on the changing demographics due to immigration; it is due to the active participation of groups in transforming the terms of their engagement with the city and City government. I conclude that postcolonial planning is an emergent planning practice in Toronto, based on knowledge that is situated in the Alternative Planning Group's communities, and in their shared histories of immigration and social marginalization.

Journal of learning disabilities	https://doi.org/10.1177/002221949002300111	A substantial body of research confirms higher verbal ability in normally achieving females and higher visual-spatial and mathematical abilities in normally achieving males. However, the specific nature of these differences varies by age, specific measure, magnitude, and variability within the groups. Re-analysis of earlier research showed that, although differences in visual-spatial ability were larger than verbal ability differences, gender differences did not account for more than 1% to 5% of the group variance. In the population with learning disabilities (LD), research must be interpreted cautiously because LD samples were drawn mainly from the system-identified population and may reflect selection bias. Findings indicate that system-identified females with LD are lower in IQ, have more severe academic achievement deficits in some aspects of reading and math, and are somewhat better in visual-motor abilities, spelling, and written language mechanics than males with LD. In mathematics, however, it is difficult to document consistent differences in computational skills in the elementary school ages. More consistent findings, however, indicate superiority in mathematical reasoning in males with LD. A limited number of studies on research-identified samples indicate that findings from studies of school-identified LD samples must be interpreted cautiously because females with LD identified in the schools may not be representative of females with LD in general.

Difficulties to acquire these central skills can lead to severe consequences for an individual’s well-being and nation’s economy. In the present review, we describe our current broad understanding of the functional and structural brain organization that supports the development of numbers and arithmetic. The existing evidence points towards a complex interaction among multiple domain-specific (e.g., representation of quantities and number symbols) and domain-general (e.g., working memory, visual–spatial abilities) cognitive processes, as well as a dynamic integration of several brain regions into functional networks that support these processes. These networks are mainly, but not exclusively, located in regions of the frontal and parietal cortex, and the functional and structural dynamics of these networks differ as a function of age and performance level. Distinctive brain activation patterns have also been shown for children with dyscalculia, a specific learning disability in the domain of mathematics. Although our knowledge about the developmental brain dynamics of number and arithmetic has greatly improved over the past years, many questions about the interaction and the causal involvement of the abovementioned functional brain networks remain. This review provides a broad and critical overview of the known developmental processes and what is yet to be discovered. © 2021, The Author(s).	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

The model incorporates multivariate genetic and environmental influences, cultural transmission, assortative mating, and environmental influences shared by offspring, and it permits the estimation of genetic and environmental correlations. The model is applied to data from nuclear families, MZ twin pairs, and DZ twin pairs in which at least one child was diagnosed as being reading disabled and to data from control families and twins. Three cognitive ability measures (Reading, Coding Speed, and Spatial Ability) were analyzed simultaneously. Results indicate that genetic influences are moderate, with significant genetic correlations among characters. Cultural transmission is negligible, as are the environmental correlations.

There is no evidence for sibling shared environmental influences; however, there are significant twin shared environmental effects for each measure but not between measures. © 1986 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

A method is presented for applying the analytical technique of path analysis to general multivariate models of familial resemblance. In path models formulated using this approach, variables are defined as column vectors, path coefficients are defined as matrices of path coefficients, and correlations are defined as matrices of correlations. By applying a few simple rules for multivariate path analysis, general multivariate expected correlations or covariances can be derived from a path diagram that is essentially as simple as a univariate diagram which can be used to analyze any number of variables.    The method is used to formulate a multivariate model of familial resemblance for the analysis of data obtained from nuclear families, monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. The model incorporates multivariate genetic and environmental influences, cultural transmission, assortative mating, sibling shared environment, and twin shared environment, and permits estimation of genetic and environmental correlations. The model is applied to data from 122 nuclear families with a reading-disabled child and from 34 MZ twin pairs and 29 DZ pairs, at least one member of which was diagnosed as being reading disabled; and data from 122 control nuclear families, 30 control MZ twin pairs, and 14 control DZ pairs. Three composite cognitive ability measures (Reading, Coding Speed, and Spatial ability) were analyzed simultaneously. Correlational structure between groups does not differ. In order to approximate multivariate normality more closely, population parameters were estimated using a weighted pooling of data from reading-disabled and control subjects and their family members. Resulting parameter estimates and tests of successively more parsimonious models indicate that genetic influences are moderate, with significant genetic correlations among characters. Cultural transmission is negligible, as are the environmental correlations. Assortative mating is significant only for the Reading measure. There is no evidence for sibling shared environmental influences, but there are significant special twin shared environmental correlations for each measure, but not between measures.

The goal of the present authors was to verify whether the child with WS displayed a cognitive profile which is unique to the syndrome. Several tests designed to assess visuo-perceptual, visuo-motor, linguistic and memory abilities were administered to both children when they were 10.9 years old. Compared to his sister, the boy with WS displayed a homogeneous developmental delay in both non-verbal and verbal abilities. He achieved a level of performance similar to his sister only in facial recognition, phonological word fluency and memory for phonologically similar words. Furthermore, despite the overall delayed performance of the boy, both the twins displayed a cognitive profile characterized by strength in lexical comprehension and relative weakness in visuo-motor abilities.

To determine the principles underlying infants' tendency to shift gaze to the exiting side before the object arrives, occluder width, oscillation frequency, and motion amplitude were manipulated resulting in occlusion durations between 0.20 and 1.66 s. Through these manipulations, we were able to distinguish between several possible modes of behavior underlying 'predictive' actions at occluders. Four such modes were tested. First, if passage-of-time determines when saccades are made, the tendency to shift gaze over the occluder is expected to be a function of time since disappearance. Second, if visual salience of the exiting occluder edge determines when saccades are made, occluder width would determine the pre-reappearance gaze shifts but not oscillation frequency, amplitude, or velocity. Third, if memory of the duration of the previous occlusion determines when the subjects shift gaze over the occluder, it is expected that the gaze will shift after the same latency at the next occlusion irrespective of whether occlusion duration is changed or not. Finally, if infants base their pre-reapperance gaze shifts on their ability to represent object motion (cognitive mode), it is expected that the latency of the gaze shifts over the occluder is scaled to occlusion duration. Eye and head movements as well as object motion were measured at 240 Hz. In 49% of the passages, the infants shifted gaze to the opposite side of the occluder before the object arrived there. The tendency to make such gaze shifts could not be explained by the passage of time since disappearance. Neither could it be fully explained in terms of visual information present during occlusion, i.e. occluder width. On the contrary, it was found that the latency of the pre-reappearance gaze shifts was determined by the time of object reappearance and that it was a function of all three factors manipulated. The results suggest that object velocity is represented during occlusion and that infants track the object behind the occluder in their 'mind's eye'.

Individual differences in intelligence, spatial ability, strategy selection biases, and gender are all associated with proficiency in mental rotation. Interventions and activities that develop and improve mental rotation skills also increase success in the STEM and related domains. Thus, intellectually gifted students interested in these domains need opportunities to develop their mental rotation skills and spatially gifted students need opportunities to develop their skills in the STEM domains. Parents, teachers, and programs for the gifted should provide these opportunities and increase emphasis on developing spatial abilities, generally, and mental rotation, in particular, for our gifted children. © 2013 Copyright The Roeper Institute.

M.	2013	journalArticle	Learning anatomy enhances spatial ability.	Anatomical sciences education	https://doi.org/10.1002/ase.1346	Spatial ability is an important factor in learning anatomy. Students with high scores on a mental rotation test (MRT) systematically score higher on anatomy  examinations. This study aims to investigate if learning anatomy also oppositely  improves the MRT-score. Five hundred first year students of medicine (n = 242,  intervention) and educational sciences (n = 258, control) participated in a pretest  and posttest MRT, 1 month apart. During this month, the intervention group studied  anatomy and the control group studied research methods for the social sciences. In  the pretest, the intervention group scored 14.40 (SD: ± 3.37) and the control group  13.17 (SD: ± 3.36) on a scale of 20, which is a significant difference (t-test, t =  4.07, df = 498, P < 0.001). Both groups show an improvement on the posttest compared  to the pretest (paired samples t-test, t = 12.21/14.71, df = 257/241, P < 0.001).  The improvement in the intervention group is significantly higher (ANCOVA, F =  16.59, df = 1;497, P < 0.001). It is concluded that (1) medical students studying  anatomy show greater improvement between two consecutive MRTs than educational  science students; (2) medical students have a higher spatial ability than  educational sciences students; and (3) if a MRT is repeated there seems to be a test  effect. It is concluded that spatial ability may be trained by studying anatomy. The  overarching message for anatomy teachers is that a good spatial ability is  beneficial for learning anatomy and learning anatomy may be beneficial for students'  spatial ability. This reciprocal advantage implies that challenging students on  spatial aspects of anatomical knowledge could have a twofold effect on their  learning.

Thirty-six effect sizes from published and unpublished studies examining the influence of time constraints were retrieved. Results showed that gender differences in mental rotation are significantly larger when the task is administered with time constraints compared to when such constraints are absent. In addition, the magnitude of gender differences was linearly related to the amount of time available for test completion. These findings were not related to the age or the year of birth of participants in the retrieved studies. The results are discussed with regard to their implications for explanations of gender differences in mental rotation and cognitive abilities in general. © 2010 Psychonomic Society, Inc.

Furthermore, it has been argued that the male advantage in spatial abilities can be explained by a sex difference in visual-spatial working memory. Therefore, sex differences in visual-spatial working memory have important implication for research, theory, and practice, but they have yet to be quantified. The present meta-analysis quantified the magnitude of sex differences in visual-spatial working memory and examined variables that might moderate them. The analysis used a set of 180 effect sizes from healthy males and females drawn from 98 samples ranging in mean age from 3 to 86 years. Multilevel meta-analysis was used on the overall data set to account for non-independent effect sizes. The data also were analyzed in separate task subgroups by means of multilevel and mixed-effects models. Results showed a small but significant male advantage (mean d = 0.155, 95 % confidence interval = 0.087-0.223). All the tasks produced a male advantage, except for memory for location, where a female advantage emerged. Age of the participants was a significant moderator, indicating that sex differences in visual-spatial working memory appeared first in the 13-17 years age group. Removing memory for location tasks from the sample affected the pattern of significant moderators. The present results indicate a male advantage in visual-spatial working memory, although age and specific task modulate the magnitude and direction of the effects. Implications for clinical applications, cognitive model building, and experimental research are discussed. © 2016, Psychonomic Society, Inc.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

The present study sought to answer the following questions: Do the same children struggle with numeracy year after year? What skills do children with numeracy difficulties lack? What underlying factors support numeracy achievement? What are the early indicators of numeracy difficulties? The results indicated that the majority of fourth grade children with numeracy difficulties experienced similar difficulties in previous years, indicating a stability of functioning in this area. Furthermore, working memory and mathematical background knowledge were found to have a robust relationship with numeracy achievement and numeracy difficulties, whereas visual-spatial ability, short-term memory, processing speed, and phonological processing did not demonstrate a reliable relationship with numeracy. Together, these results indicate that working memory and math background knowledge are involved in numeracy development in children from first to fourth grade and that across this time period, children with numeracy difficulties struggle with tasks that require complex numerical processing. Educational implications are discussed.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Methods: Using data from 218 mother-child dyads from the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, we examined prenatal and childhood (3 and 8 years) serum concentrations of four PFAS and inattention, impulsivity, and visual spatial abilities. At 8 years, we used the Conners’ Continuous Performance Test-II to assess attention and impulse control and the Virtual Morris Water Maze (VMWM) to measure visual spatial abilities. Results: In multiple informant models, there was no evidence to indicate that prenatal or childhood PFAS are associated with attention. However, there was an inverse association between prenatal ln-perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and errors of commission (β = −2.0, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] −3.8, −0.3). Ln-perfluorononanoate (PFNA) at 3 years was associated with longer (poorer) VMWM completion times of 3.6 seconds (CI 1.6, 5.6). However, higher concurrent concentrations of ln-perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) (β = −2.4 s, 95% CI −4.4, −0.3) were associated with shorter (better) times. Higher prenatal PFHxS was positively associated with percentage of traveling distance in the correct quadrant (β = 4.2%, 95% CI 0.8, 7.7), indicating better performance. Conclusion: Findings were mixed for prenatal and childhood PFAS concentrations and visual spatial abilities. There is not enough evidence to support that PFAS are associated with visual spatial abilities as assessed by the VMWM or CPT-II measures of inattention or impulsivity in children at age 8 years. © 2018	ASK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		5	3	0	3	3	0	0	1

The Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, a prospective birth cohort (2003–2006, Cincinnati, OH), was used to examine prenatal and childhood PBDEs and visual spatial abilities in 199 children. PBDEs were measured at 16±3 weeks gestation and at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 years using gas chromatography/isotope dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry. We used the Virtual Morris Water Maze to measure visual spatial abilities at 8 years. In covariate-adjusted models, 10-fold increases in BDE-47, −99, and −100 at 5 years were associated with shorter completion times by 5.2 s (95% Confidence Interval [CI] −9.3, −1.1), 4.5 s (95% CI −8.1, −0.9), and 4.7 s (95% CI −9.0, −0.3), respectively. However, children with higher BDE-153 at 3 years had longer completion times (β=5.4 s, 95% CI −0.3, 11.1). Prenatal PBDEs were associated with improved visual spatial memory retention, with children spending a higher percentage of their search path in the correct quadrant. Child sex modified some associations between PBDEs and visual spatial learning. Longer path lengths were observed among males with increased BDE-47 at 2 and 3 years, while females had shorter paths. In conclusion, prenatal and postnatal BDE-28, −47, −99, and −100 at 5 and 8 years were associated with improved visual spatial abilities, whereas a pattern of impairments in visual spatial learning was noted with early childhood BDE-153 concentrations. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Child development		A chronometric mental rotation paradigm was applied to examine manipulation of visual imagery in early adolescence in relation to age, sex, mental rotation ability  (measured psychometrically), and socioeconomic background. Fifth- and seventh-grade  boys and girls from middle and lower socioeconomic backgrounds viewed  tachistiscopically letters of the alphabet presented at 0 degrees, 60 degrees, 120  degrees, and 180 degrees of rotation and were asked to judge whether the letter was  forward or backward. In one condition, children were given no information about the  test letter, and in the other, advance visual information about its identity and  orientation was provided. With age, children became more skillful at rotating and  were more likely to show evidence of using the advance information as a visual  image. There were no sex differences. Socioeconomic differences were more pronounced  in the fifth than the seventh grade.

Patients performed less well than controls on word fluency, perception of left and right, visuo‐motor co‐ordination, visual memory and motor learning. They also showed a higher incidence of left‐ear advantage on a dichotic listening test for phonemic stimuli than did controls. There was no clear evidence for a specific deficit in spatial ability in the patients tested.

Those maturing late were more lateralized for speech than those maturing early. Sex differences in mental abilities, it is argued, reflect differences in the organization of cortical function that are related to differential rates of physical maturation.

These two types of movements both involve rotation, but differ on a number of components. Here, we break down action and gesture into components—feeling an object during rotation, using a grasping handshape during rotation, tracing the trajectory of rotation, and seeing the outcome of rotation—and ask, in two studies, how training children on a mental rotation task through different combinations of these components impacts learning gains across a delay. Our results extend the literature by showing that, although all children benefit from training experiences, some training experiences are more beneficial than others, and the pattern differs by sex. Not seeing the outcome of rotation emerged as a crucial training component for both males and females. However, not seeing the outcome turned out to be the only necessary component for males (who showed equivalent gains when imagining or gesturing object rotation). Females, in contrast, only benefitted from not seeing the outcome when it involved producing a relevant motor movement (i.e., when gesturing the rotation of the object and not simply imagining the rotation of the object). Results are discussed in relation to potential mechanisms driving these effects and practical implications.

Methods: Headache status was determined at age 26 (migraine, tension-type headache [TTH], headache-free control subjects) according to International Headache Society criteria, and data relating to cognitive and academic performance from ages 3 to 26 years were analyzed. Results: Study members diagnosed with migraine were subtly but significantly impaired, compared with those with TTH and headache-free control subjects, on tests of verbal ability (especially language reception) from ages 3 to 13, independent of headache history. Performance on other tasks, including reading, arithmetic, motor, and spatial ability, was normal. The association between migraine and verbal functioning also appeared to impact on later academic success. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the poorer verbal performance was unlikely to have resulted from cumulative attacks and may be due to developmental factors beginning in utero.

Perceptual and motor skills	https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.1992.74.2.599	This research explored ways gifted children with learning disabilities perceive and recall auditory and visual input and apply this information to reading, mathematics, and spelling. 24 learning-disabled/gifted children and a matched control group of normally achieving gifted students were tested for oral reading, word recognition and analysis, listening comprehension, and spelling. In mathematics, they were tested for numeration, mental and written computation, word problems, and numerical reasoning. To explore perception and memory skills, students were administered formal tests of visual and auditory memory as well as auditory discrimination of sounds. Their responses to reading and to mathematical computations were further considered for evidence of problems in visual discrimination, visual sequencing, and visual spatial areas. Analyses indicated that these learning-disabled/gifted students were significantly weaker than controls in their decoding skills, in spelling, and in most areas of mathematics. They were also significantly weaker in auditory discrimination and memory, and in visual discrimination, sequencing, and spatial abilities. Conclusions are that these underlying perceptual and memory deficits may be related to students' academic problems.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Front. Educ. Conf. FIE	https://doi.org/10.1109/FIE.2010.5673182	Spatial reasoning and visualization skills are critical skills for Computer Science, Engineering, and Technology (CSET) students. The Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualizations of Rotations (PSVT:R) is considered the "gold standard" of spatial assessments and is a paper-and-pencil test that requires the mental rotation of three-dimensional connected cubes. Consistently, results on this test show sex differences, with men performing better than women. Spatial cognition is more than just mental rotation, however, and CSET education needs a variety of assessment tools and methods. In this session, participants will engage in a variety of spatial reasoning and visualization problems to expand their understanding of this area. We will explore different ways to assess spatial skills and consider the complex interactions of context, resources, and multiple strategies. By reviewing the literature on how children develop spatial understanding, CSET faculty can expand the options they consider when designing learning opportunities and assessment methods for college students. Another thread woven throughout this session is the consideration of differential performance of subgroups on various tests of spatial skills. The PSVT:R and tests like it often show sex differences and SES differences in performance, especially under timed-response conditions. In this session, we will consider potential explanations for these differences and outline some open areas for research. © 2010 IEEE.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

The Journal of genetic psychology	https://doi.org/10.1080/00221325.1990.9914617	This study explored the relationship between illegitimate birth and cognitive development among 513 boys on probation. Prior research has shown that being part of  a single-parent household leads to diminished verbal capacities and often puts a  child in greater danger of abuse and neglect. Frequent abuse is thought to lead to  the enhancement of visual and spatial skills relative to verbal skills through a  process of "frozen watchfulness". I hypothesized that illegitimate boys from  one-parent homes would have greater verbal-performance discrepancy scores than would  boys from other combinations of birth status and family structure. These boys had  the lowest verbal IQ and highest performance IQ scores and, hence, the largest  discrepancy. These boys also suffered the highest degree of abuse and neglect of all  four birth status/family structure combinations studied.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, clinical use of these immunotherapies is not effective, because the vaccination is administered too late. At 1 month of age, 100 μL of Aβ3-10-KLH peptide (vaccine, 2 μg/μL) was subcutaneously injected into the neck of an amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1/tau transgenic (3×Tg-AD) mouse model. Aβ3-10-KLH peptide was re-injected at 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 months of age. Serum levels of Aβ antibody were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while spatial learning and memory ability were evaluated by Morris water maze. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect total tau with HT7 and phosphorylated tau with AT8 (phosphorylation sites Ser202 and Thr205) and AT180 (phosphorylation site Thr231) antibodies in the hippocampus. In addition, western blot analysis was used to quantify AT8 and AT180 expression in the hippocampus. The results showed that after vaccine injection, mice produced high levels of Aβ antibody, cognitive function was significantly improved, and total tau and phosphorylated tau levels were significantly reduced. These findings suggest that early active immunization with Aβ3-10-KLH vaccine can greatly reduce tau phosphorylation, thereby mitigating the cognitive decline of 3×Tg-AD mice.

There were a total of 120 10-12 year old students. Thirty students had been diagnosed as dyslexic in Taiwan (T.W. dyslexia) and thirty students had been diagnosed as dyslexic in Hong Kong (H.K. dyslexia). Overall, 30 of the Taiwanese participants (T.W. normal) and 30 of the Hong Kong participants (H.K. normal) had received no special education. Dyslexic individuals were diagnosed by the doctors' clinical determination. The material was designed using Autodesk 3ds Max. The participants rotated 3D figures by themselves to find a ball. The results indicated that there was very little difference between dyslexic and normal students. However, the most significant difference between dyslexic and normal student was answering speed, especially in the combined data and the male data. An one-way ANOVA test indicated that in terms of rate and answering speed there was no difference between the H.K. and the T.W. dyslexics. Similar results were also found for the students with normal reading abilities in T.W. and H.K. The criterions for defining the visuo-spatial abilities of dyslexia students appear to be similar in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In addition, there is no difference between students' visuo-spatial abilities even though Chinese literacy instructions differed in the two areas. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Among various cognitive skills, spatial skills are considered a strong predictor of children's future math and reading performance. This study examined the relations between Chinese kindergarteners’ spatial skills and their subsequent math and reading achievement in second grade. Spatial skills (spatial perception, spatial visualization, and mental rotation), vocabulary, working memory, self-regulation ability, and academic competencies of 182 Chinese children were assessed in their last year of kindergarten. Follow up tests were then conducted on the children's academic competencies in math and reading in second grade. After controlling for demographics and a range of early domain-general and academic skill variables in a multilevel model, the unique associations between the children's early spatial skills and their academic achievement in second grade were assessed. The results showed that the children's spatial visualization ability in kindergarten was positively related to their math and reading performance in second grade. The children's spatial perception ability was also positively associated with their math performance in second grade. No association was found between early mental rotation and academic performance in second grade. Overall, the findings suggest that early spatial skills may have long-term effects on children's academic achievement in primary school. The effects need to be understood in the Chinese sociocultural context. The implications of the findings are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

It is not known whether reducing exposure is associated with improved intelligence. objective: We aimed to determine whether reducing As exposure is associated with improved child intellectual outcomes. Methods: Three hundred three 10-year-old children drinking from household wells with a wide range of As concentrations were enrolled at baseline. In the subsequent year, deep community wells, low in As, were installed in villages of children whose original wells had high water As (WAs ≥ 50 μg/L). For 296 children, intelligence was assessed by WISC-IV (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th ed.), with a version modified for the study population, at baseline and approximately 2 years later; analyses considered standardized scores for both Full Scale IQ and Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indices. Creatinine-adjusted urinary arsenic (UAs/Cr), blood As (BAs), and blood manganese (BMn) were assessed at both times. results: UAs/Cr concentrations declined significantly by follow-up for both the high (≥ 50 μg/L) and low (< 50 μg/L) WAs subgroups. At baseline, adjusting for maternal age and intelligence, plasma ferritin, head circumference, home environment quality, school grade, and BMn, UAs/Cr was significantly negatively associated with Full Scale IQ, and with all Index scores (except Processing Speed). After adjustment for baseline Working Memory scores and school grade, each 100-μg/g reduction in UAs/Cr from baseline to follow-up was associated with a 0.91 point increase in Working Memory (95% CI: 0.14, 1.67). The change in UAs/Cr across follow-up was not significantly associated with changes in Full Scale IQ or Index scores. conclusions: Installation of deep, low-As community wells lowered UAs, BAs, and BMn. A greater decrease in UAs/Cr was associated with greater improvements in Working Memory scores, but not with a greater improvement in Full Scale IQ. © EPA/National Geographic Channel/Alamy.

However, no research to date has attempted to understand which specific features in these games tap into players' spatial ability or how individual player differences interact with these game features. This knowledge is crucially important as a first step towards understanding what makes these games effective and why, especially for subpopulations with lower spatial ability such as women and girls. We present the first empirical study analyzing the relationship between spatial ability, specific game features, and individual player differences using a custom-built computer game. Twenty children took a pretest of spatial skills and then played our game for 2 hours. We found that spatial ability pretest scores predicted several player behaviors related to in-game tasks involving 3D object construction and first person navigation. However, when analyzed by gender, girls' pretest scores were much less predictive of player behavior. © 2017 ACM.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Those with low spatial skill often struggle in introductory college-level STEM coursework and drop out of STEM majors. Fortunately, spatial skills are quite malleable. Video games present a particularly promising way of training spatial skills; certain commercial video games, such as Medal of Honor, Portal 2, and Tetris, have been empirically shown to improve players' spatial skills after just a few hours of training [3, 4, 5], and video games provide a motivational advantage over other forms of spatial skill training interventions since they are designed to be fun. However, other commercial games, such as the "brain-training" game Lumosity, seem to have no effect on players' spatial skills [5]. It is not clear what makes some games effective and others ineffective at spatial skill training, which makes it difficult to design game-based spatial skill training interventions to improve students' STEM proficiency and retention.Prior work studying the effectiveness of game-based spatial skill training interventions is also limited by the fact that it does not take the their motivational appeal to their target audience into account - the main advantage games have over other kinds of training interventions. Low spatial skill students, who are disproportionately female, stand the most to gain from spatial skill training interventions through improved proficiency in STEM coursework, but are not targeted in the design or evaluation of spatial skill training games.In this dissertation, I present a data-driven, player-centric approach to designing spatial skill training video games that contributes to our understanding of what game features may contribute to a game's effectiveness at training spatial skills and its motivational appeal to its critical target audience of low spatial skill students. First, I explain the design of Homeworld Bound, a game I designed as a testbed for evaluating the ability of different spatial game features to tap into players' spatial skills and demonstrate its effectiveness as a training intervention for children. In my first study, I demonstrate my data-driven approach to evaluating the effectiveness of specific game features at tapping into players' spatial skills by analyzing the relationship between player performance and spatial skill in Homeworld Bound. My results reveal that most of the levels in Homeworld Bound successfully tap into players' spatial skills and provide insights about how to fix the levels that do not.In my second study, I take a player-centric approach to designing the player experience of spatial skill training games, investigating how demographic factors and gaming habits, preferences, and motivations predict spatial skill in young adults. I use my findings to develop a set of recommendations for designing spatial skill training games that appeal to low spatial skill young adults specifically. I then present a revised and improved version of Homeworld Bound, Homeworld Bound: Redux, and demonstrate how I incorporated my findings from my data-driven and player-centered research studies to improve the game's ability to tap into players' spatial skills and its motivational appeal for low spatial skill young adults. Finally, I present the results of a controlled training study I conducted in a large introductory STEM course for non-majors to evaluate the training effectiveness and motivational appeal of Homeworld Bound: Redux for low spatial skill college students. While I found no training effects of Homeworld Bound: Redux compared to alternative training programs after 70 minutes of training, I found that performance on certain levels of the game was correlated with spatial skill and that low spatial skill students were more intrinsically motivated to play the game than to complete a non-game spatial skill training intervention.My findings in this dissertation contribute a deeper understanding of what features influence a game's effectiveness at training spatial skills and motivating low spatial skill students to play it. These findings can be used to inform the design of more effective and motivating spatial skill training interventions in the future to promote the development of skills critical for pursuing STEM majors and careers.

Participants consisted of 361 diagnostically heterogeneous children between the ages 6 through 8 years inclusive who were assessed on a comprehensive neuropsychological battery of tests in the Windsor-Detroit region. CWFT-R performance of the 7- and 8-year-old clinic-referred children was compared to a 7- and 8-year-old sample of normal children, who had been utilized in previous research. Using partial correlations to control for age effects, the data of the 361 clinic-referred children were subjected to Principal Components Analysis, which generated a 3-factor solution accounting for 55% of the total variance. Correlations between the CWFT-R and measures of verbal ability, phonological processing, nonverbal problem-solving and visual-spatial skills were examined.    Results were discussed in terms of the influence of developmental maturation on cognitive abilities, and the observed differential relationship between various neuropsychological ability domains.

The British journal of educational psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12304	BACKGROUND: Preschoolers' knowledge of the principle of static equilibrium is an important research focus for understanding children's science content knowledge.  Hitherto studies have mainly used behavioural observation with small samples. Thus,  extending these studies with a validated test instrument is desirable. AIMS: The aim  was to validate an instrument (the Centre-of-Mass Test), which is concerned with  preschoolers' knowledge of the principle of static equilibrium, using item response  theory. In Study 1, the construct structure was tested, and in Study 2, its  relationship with stabilities of symmetrical blocks, figural reasoning, figural  perception, mental rotation, level of interest, self-concept, motivation, and  language capacity was investigated. SAMPLES: A total of 217 five- and six-year-old  children participated in Study 1 and 166 five- and six-year-old children in Study 2.  METHODS: All tests were administered as paper-pencil picture tests in groups and  single interviews. RESULTS: In Study 1, the Centre-of-Mass Test's conformity with a  1PL-testlet model with an overall knowledge of static equilibrium and with two  subtests, estimation of stable and unstable constructions, was confirmed. Using a  95% binomial distribution, children were categorized into three knowledge  categories: geometrical-centre, centre-of-mass, and undifferentiated knowledge. In  Study 2, knowledge of the principle of static equilibrium showed positive  correlations with figural perception and reasoning, language capacity, and  estimation of the stabilities of symmetrical objects. CONCLUSIONS: The  Centre-of-Mass Test measures knowledge of the principle of static equilibrium as a  unidimensional construct and mirrors preschoolers' estimations found in previous  studies. The acquisition of a more sophisticated static equilibrium knowledge is  related to spatial knowledge and language capacity.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Each participant completed two spatial tasks and a survey assessing favored spatial activities across five categories (computers, toys, sports, music, and art) and three developmental periods (early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence). The first phase of analysis determined the percentage of favorite activities by category and developmental period; the second phase examined how participants with the highest scores on each spatial measure differed in their experiences. Findings showed that certain activities (e.g., playing video games and soccer) tended to reemerge across periods and be linked to strong spatial skills. Implications for nurturing high achievers' potential to succeed in spatially demanding careers are discussed. © The Author(s) 2012.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In previous studies, coal permeability is normally measured as a function of gas pressure under the conditions of constant effective stresses, uniaxial strains and constant confining pressures. In all these experiments, an equilibrium state between coal matrix and fracture is normally assumed. This assumption has essentially excluded the effect of matrix–fracture interactions on the evolution of coal permeability. In this study, we hypothesize that the current equilibrium assumption is responsible for the discrepancy between theoretical expectations and experimental measurements. Under this hypothesis, the evolution of coal permeability is determined by the effective stress gap between coal matrix and fracture. This hypothesis is tested through an experiment of CO2 injection into a coal core under the constant effective stress. In this experiment, the effective stress in the fracture system is unchanged while the effective stress in the matrix evolves as a function of time. In the experiment, the coal permeability was measured continuously throughout the whole period of the experiment (~ 80 days). The experimental results show that the core expands rapidly at the beginning due to the gas injection-induced poroelastic effect. After the injection, the core length remains almost unchanged. But, the measured permeability declines from 60 to 0.48 μD for the first month. It rebounds slowly for the subsequent 2 months. These results indicate that the effective stress gap has a significant impact on the evolution of coal permeability. The switch of permeability from the initial reduction (the first 30 days) to rebound (the subsequent 50 days) suggests a transition of matrix deformation from nearby the fracture wall to further away area. These findings demonstrate that the evolution of coal permeability is primarily controlled by the spatial transformation of effective stresses between matrix and fracture. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

Much less  is known about gender difference in approximate arithmetic. Given that approximate  arithmetic is closely associated with visuospatial processing, which shows a male  advantage we hypothesized that males would perform better than females in  approximate arithmetic. In two experiments (496 children in Experiment 1 and 554  college students in Experiment 2), we found that males showed better performance in  approximate arithmetic, which was accounted for by gender differences in spatial  ability.

Psychological science	https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797611427168	Studies have shown that female children, on average, consistently outperform male children in arithmetic. In the research reported here, 1,556 pupils (8 to 11 years  of age) from urban and rural regions in the greater Beijing area completed 10  cognitive tasks. Results showed that girls outperformed boys in arithmetic tasks  (i.e., simple subtraction, complex multiplication), as well as in  numerosity-comparison, number-comparison, number-series-completion, choice reaction  time, and word-rhyming tasks. Boys outperformed girls in a mental rotation task.  Controlling for scores on the word-rhyming task eliminated gender differences in  arithmetic, whereas controlling for scores on numerical-processing tasks (number  comparison, numerosity estimation, numerosity comparison, and number-series  completion) and general cognitive tasks (choice reaction time, Raven's Progressive  Matrices, and mental rotation) did not. These results suggest that girls' advantage  in arithmetic is likely due to their advantage in language processing.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Approximately 275 students from three public high schools participated in the study. Scores from the Space Relations subtest of the Differential Aptitude Test (Bennett, Seashore, & Wesman, 1982) were used to determine the spatial ability of each student. Three treatment groups were used. In the first, concrete objects were used to model the problems, but only the teacher manipulated the objects. In the second group, perspective drawings took the place of manipulatives. The third group used the same manipulatives as the first group, but each student manipulated the models.    A researcher-designed posttest was used to evaluate achievement in the unit. After approximately 1 month, a retention test was given. Each test consisted of four subtests--describing a locus in the plane, describing a locus in space, recognizing the intersection of loci in the plane, and recognizing the intersection of loci in space.    On the first subtest of the posttest, describing a locus in the plane, students with high spatial ability in the perspective drawing group outperformed their counterparts in the teacher manipulative group. On describing a locus in space, students in the student manipulative group scored higher than those in the teacher manipulative group.    On recognizing the intersection of loci in the plane, females with high spatial ability had higher achievement scores than males with high spatial ability. For students with low spatial ability, male students outperformed female students. Recognizing intersections of loci in space produced many interaction effects. For students with high spatial ability, the perspective drawing group scored significantly higher than either manipulative group. For students with medium spatial ability, the perspective drawing group outperformed the student manipulative group. Among males, the perspective drawing group outperformed the student manipulative group. Again, the females with high spatial ability had higher achievement scores than the comparable males.    Although high spatial ability was associated with high achievement on all of the subtests of both the posttest and the retention test, the retention test yielded little additional information. However, on recognizing intersections in the plane, females in the student manipulative group outscored females in the teacher manipulative group.

It presented in detail the argument that many chemical contaminants in the environment interfere with the biological function of hormones by blocking, mimicking, displacing, or acting through a variety of other mechanisms to subvert their natural roles. Although the argument rested primarily on observations in wildlife and on laboratory experiments, its cogency for human health was undeniable: the same chemicals and hormones are found in humans. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include many types of substances encompassing many different chemical structures acting through diverse biological mechanisms to exert their effects. The latter include estrogenic, androgenic, and anti-estrogenic anti-androgenic effects, and altered thyroid function. Although disorders of reproductive function first brought these agents to our attention, their potential to interfere with brain development is now seen as at least equally significant for public health. All twelve of the chemicals listed as persistent organic pollutants, the "dirty dozen," which were the subject of a global treaty to abolish their use, earned their labels, in part, because of their potency as endocrine disruptors. This list contained the following organochlorine compounds: dioxins, furans, PCBs, DDT, hexachlorobenzene, chlordane, toxaphene, dieldrin, aldrin, endrin, heptachlor, and mirex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2003) has published exposure data for 116 chemicals from NHANES 1999-2000. The data include statistics on the distribution of blood or urine levels for each environmental chemical. All have been shown, directly or indirectly, to modify endocrine function. They include:*Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)*Dioxins, furans, and coplanar PCBs*Non-coplanar PCBs*Phytoestrogens (e.g., soy)*Selected organophosphate pesticides*Organochlorine pesticides*Carbamate pesticides*Herbicides*Pest repellents and disinfectants*Metals (lead, mercury, cadmium)*Cotinine (nicotine metabolite)*Phthalates. This list illustrates a crucial principle: we now carry in our bodies a broth of chemicals to which our forebears were never exposed. Although we seek, by a variety of maneuvers, to isolate the contributions of individual agents in our research, we cannot totally extract them from this baseline confounding. We do not know which combinations are additive, which antagonistic, or which are synergistic. It challenges logic to accept the proposition that the sum of their biological effects is zero, the assumption that underlies the setting of current exposure standards. Hormones and Toxicology: Endocrine systems serve an essential function: they enable signals from a specific organ to evoke a dynamic, coordinated response in a distant target tissue. Their role, generally, is to maintain homeostasis. In some instances, however, the signal originates outside the body. This possibility is the core issue generating concerns about endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Three properties of EDCs claimed particular force. One arose from the roles played by hormones in fetal development. As we already knew from our experience with lead, mercury, alcohol, and other chemicals, exposure levels that exert minimal or transient effects in adults can produce lasting damage during development. Many toxic chemicals pass easily from mother to fetus and from breast milk to the neonate. The second concern arose from the tendency of many endocrine disruptors to persist in the environment because they resist degradation, bioaccumulate in the food chain as they ascend predator levels, and are stored in the body's fat depots, where they are slowly metabolized and excreted; the half-life in humans of the prototypical dioxin, tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin or TCDD, is 7 to 10 years. When fat is mobilized during pregnancy or lactation, the fetus or neonate may be exposed to substantially elevated levels. Other EDCs, such as phthalates, are so ubiquitous in the environment that exposure is constant although their half-lives may range from weeks to months. The third property generating concern was the geographical mobility of such agents. Arctic species, such as polar bears, are heavily contaminated with chemicals generated far from the original sites of discharge into the environment (Skaare et al., 2002). The contaminants are carried to the arctic by global weather patterns and by the toxic loads in the bears' customary prey. Hormones occupy a crucial role during development. Hormonal mechanisms act as arbiters of brain structure and neurochemistry. Gonadal hormones direct and modulate the processes underlying sexual differentiation of the brain. Thyroid hormones regulate neuronal and glial proliferation as well as cell migration and differentiation. Glucocorticoids play essential roles in several aspects of normal brain development, especially through their enduring effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its role in behavior. Basic research in neuroendocrinology provides the basis both for these linkages and for the health concerns evoked by EDCs. Because endocrine disruption is such a new aspect of environmental toxicology, however, our current knowledge of its scope and manifestations in human populations remains scattered. And, because of our incomplete grasp of these properties, this chapter provides a basic window on the EDC issue rather than a comprehensive survey of its role in human health. Much of it, necessarily, will come from animal experiments and observations in wildlife. We will cover only a few chemical classes, some of the implications of which for humans have at present to be hypothesized rather than confirmed. Furthermore, the mechanistic relevance of some EDCs to neurobehavioral toxicity has not been established; dioxin, for example, probably exerts such toxic effects by mechanisms apart from its hormonal effects. Perhaps the main reason EDCs became the subjects of such profound unease is their implications for human reproductive function, especially in males. Falling sperm counts (see Swan et al., 2000), along with rising rates of testicular cancer, cryptorchidism, and hypospadias, have generated questions about the possible contribution of environmental chemicals to these trends. Sharpe and Skakkebaek (1993) first proposed such a link. In 2003, Skakkebaek (2003) advanced the hypothesis more directly:There is evidence that poor semen quality, testicular cancer, undescended testes and hypospadias are symptoms of one underlying entity, testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS), which may be increasingly common due to adverse environmental influences. Experimental and epidemiological studies suggest that TDS is the result of disruption of embryonal programming and gonadal development during fetal life. Sources of endocrine disruptors abound. They can be found in the form of pesticides, such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides used in agriculture, from where, as now recognized, they drift into homes or pollute drinking water supplies. They can leach out of plastic containers holding intravenous fluids or even food and water (the alkylphenols). They are present in can linings and in dental sealants (Bisphenol A). They have been found in toys that young children place into their mouths (phthalates). Dispersed into aquatic environments, they can contaminate fish. Table I is a list of the more prominent disruptors already identified and their primary hormonal targets. Neurobehavioral Toxicity as an Issue: Unambiguous connections between EDCs and human neurobehavioral function exist primarily for the PCBs, as described in the chapter by Vreugdenhil and Weisglas-Kuperus in this volume. The paucity of extensive human data on EDCs compels us to rely on animal models to gauge the relevance for human function. Yet, although hormones govern much of brain development and behavior, the literature devoted to neurobehavioral endpoints and EDCs, even for animal models, is dismayingly sparse. And, even for those, few have explored effects based on complex behavioral repertoires and brain morphometry. Fewer still have featured exposure levels consistent with those measured in human populations. Schantz and Widholm (2001), in a discussion of these issues, noted the wide gaps in our knowledge of how EDCs influence cognitive function. Links between impaired endocrine function and behavioral disorders are hardly a novel phenomenon. Sexual differentiation of the brain, for example, is known to be guided primarily by the actions of gonadal hormones (Fig. 1). Disturbing the appropriate balance of these hormones during development by exogenous agents is documented to produce morphological, neurochemical, and behavioral abnormalities. This delicate balance is persuasively illustrated by the behavioral correlates of the genetic virilizing disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Females with this disorder, which exposes them to high levels of androgens during gestation as well as postnatally, exhibit behavioral patterns indicating both masculinization and defeminization (Berenbaum, 1999). For example, as children, they tend to show male preferences for toys; they are more aggressive than normal girls; they show greater spatial abilities than normal girls; and they are less interested in feminine appearance. Over a broad range of behaviors, development becomes more prototypically male because of a shift in the balance of gonadal hormones. Vreugdenhil and Weisglas-Kuperus, in their chapter in this book, note a similar but less extreme tendency correlated, in girls, with PCB/dioxin exposure.

The study also investigated whether these training experiences had an effect on self-efficacy.    Subjects were 105 high ability 9 and 10 year old children, from a suburban middle-class elementary school. Subjects were administered pre-tests including a revised form of the Vandenberg and Kuse (1978) Mental Rotations Test (MRT), the space relations subtest of the Differential Aptitude Test, fifth edition (DAT), and a researcher-prepared measure of self-efficacy adapted from the Schunk (1981) self-efficacy scale (SE).    Students in the treatment group participated in ten forty-minute training sessions, over a four week period. Lessons involved the exploration and construction of three-dimensional figures using Polydron materials. Students in the comparison group participated in a regular textbook unit on three dimensional geometry, with no hands-on experiences. Following the training sessions, post-tests identical in form to pre-tests, were administered to all students.    Pre-test performance for all three dependent variables yielded significant gender differences at the .05 alpha level. Post-test results showed significant differences favoring the treatment group for all three dependent variables. Among subjects in the treatment group, no significant gender differences were apparent for any of the three dependent variables. Among subjects in the comparison group, gender differences persisted for the MRT and the SE, but no gender differences were apparent for the DAT.    Results indicate that training with hands-on materials can have a positive effect on performance in mental rotation, spatial visualization, and self-efficacy. Results did not support the amelioration of gender differences, however, trend analysis suggests that further research including longer training periods should be conducted.

In this research we sought to further understand psychobiological processes associated with the development of hemispheric specialization by examining and comparing familial influences on hand preference in two closely related macaque species: rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) and pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). The results of our study indicate contrasting patterns of familial influence on hand preference in each species. For the rhesus macaque we found a positive correlation in the direction of hand preference between mothers and their juvenile offspring, and for the pigtailed macaque we found a negative mother-offspring correlation in the direction of hand preference. Fathers did not contribute significantly to the direction of hand preference in either species. There was a trend toward a positive correlation for strength and consistency of hand preference between parents and offspring in rhesus macaques but not in pigtailed macaques. These findings indicate that maternal influences on offspring hand preference vary between closely related primate species and lead us to question the generalizability of universal single-factor theories used to explain intergenerational transmission of hand preference in humans.

Student's spatial literacy, based on various national and international assessment results, indicates that even though there have been gains in U.S. scores over the past decade, overall performance, including those specific to spatial skills, are still below proficiency. Existing studies focused on the potential of virtual learning environment technology to reach students in a variety of academic areas, but a need still exists to study specifically the phenomenon of using Google Earth as a potentially more useful pedagogical tool to develop spatial literacy than the currently employed methods.   The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which graphicacy achievement scores of students who were immersed in a Google Earth environment were different from students who were provided with only two-dimensional instruction for developing spatial skills. Situated learning theory and the work of Piaget and Inhelder's Child's Conception of Space provided the theoretical grounding from which this study evolved. The National Research Council's call to develop spatial literacy, as seen in Learning to Think Spatially , provided the impetus to begin research.   The target population (N = 84) for this study consisted of eighth grade geography students at an upper Midwest Jr. High School during the 2009-2010 academic year. Students were assigned to the control or experimental group based on when they had geography class. Control group students ( n = 44) used two-dimensional PowerPoint images to complete activities, while experimental group students (n = 40) were immersed in the three-dimensional Google Earth world for activity completion. Research data was then compiled and statistically analyzed to answer five research questions developed for this study.   One-way ANOVAs were run on data collected and no statistically significant difference was found between the control and experimental group. However, two of the five research questions yielded practically significant data that indicates students who used Google Earth outperformed their counterparts who used PowerPoint on pattern prediction and spatial relationship understanding.

Correlation of three mnestic, three verbal and three visual-spatial skills, and six activities of daily living (ADL) with counts of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in frontal, parietal, temporal, and hippocampal cortices of both hemispheres were calculated. The skill to copy a cube correlates exclusively with the severity of Alzheimer changes in the right parietal cortex, the skill to recall visually presented and named objects with right hippocampal changes. In addition, the skills of spatial orientation, calculation, and finger position imitation correlate exclusively with right hemispheric changes. The skill of temporal orientation correlates more with the left, alternating hand movements with the right hemisphere, and naming and other verbal skills equally with changes in both hemispheres. Six of the nine cognitive skills correlate best with hippocampal changes, while ADL correlate best with parietal and not significantly with hippocampal changes. Global clinical dementia ratings as well as global pathological scores are insufficient to explain the deficits in variably severe cortical changes, and they are not adequate parameters for counselling patients, their relatives, or coaching staff in nursing homes.

For example, rotation may be guided by processes that also prime one to see results of a specific motor action. We directly test the hypothesis by means of a dual-task paradigm in which subjects perform the Cooper–Shepard mental rotation task while executing an unseen motor rotation in a given direction and at a previously-learned speed. Four results support the inference that mental rotation relies on motor processes. First, motor rotation that is compatible with mental rotation results in faster times and fewer errors in the imagery task than when the two rotations are incompatible. Second, the angle through which subjects rotate their mental images, and the angle through which they rotate a joystick handle are correlated, but only if the directions of the two rotations are compatible. Third, motor rotation modifies the classical inverted V-shaped mental rotation response time function, favoring the direction of the motor rotation; indeed, in some cases motor rotation even shifts the location of the minimum of this curve in the direction of the motor rotation. Fourth, the preceding effect is sensitive not only to the direction of the motor rotation, but also to the motor speed. A change in the speed of motor rotation can correspondingly slow down or speed up the mental rotation.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD	https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-2012-110935	Impaired cognitive function associated with use of anticholinergic drugs may be partly attributed to underlying physical illness and exposure to factors that  increase the risk of some physical disorders such as low socioeconomic status (SES)  and less education. To estimate the extent of cognitive impairment and risk of  progress to dementia associated with anticholinergic drug use and to estimate  confounding by gender, APOE, family history of dementia, lower SES, less education,  and lower childhood mental ability, we recruited 281 volunteers at age 77-78 without  overt dementia who had taken part in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932. Clinical  histories, use of medications, self reported frequency of emotional symptoms and  standardized tests of cognitive function were obtained. With and without adjustment  for age and childhood IQ, there were significant between-group differences in tests  of non-verbal reasoning and spatial ability. During 10 year follow-up, progress to  overt dementia was not associated with anticholinergic drugs use on recruitment but  female gender and a history of dementia in parent or sibling were associated with  dementia. We concluded that anticholinergic drug use in this narrow age range sample  was linked to cognitive impairment but not to subsequent dementia.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Mental rotation was defined as the capacity to imagine and anticipate movement of objects or drawings of geometric forms without actual physical manipulation. Relationships were sought between performance on mental rotation tasks and (1) severity of language learning disability and (2) specific patterns of language abilities.    The sample was comprised of 15 LLD and 15 normal subjects (3 girls and 12 boys each) aged 6 years, 6 months to 8 years, 9 months (LLD M = 7 $-$ 7, Normals M = 7 $-$ 5). On a nonlinguistic IQ measure, with no requirements for use of mental rotation (Columbia Mental Maturity Scale), scores ranged from 88 to 107 (LLD M = 96, Normals M = 99). Language skills of all subjects were measured by the total Language Quotient (LQ) (LLD M = 72, Normals M = 101) and the 5 subtests of the Test of Language Development-Primary (TOLD-P). For the normals, the LQ was 85 or higher, with no subtest score below 8. For the LLDs the LQ was below 85 or lower with a minimum of a 10 standard score point difference between the LQ and IQ scores, with the IQ being higher. Two of the 5 subtest scores were 7 or lower.    Subjects were presented with three mental rotation tasks consisting of items from the Revised Minnesota Paper Form Board Test, Thurstone's Primary Mental Abilities Test, and Kuhlmann-Finch Space Test.    The results of separate analysis of covariance (controlling for perceptual discrimination of the task designs) indicated a significant difference between the groups based on accuracy but not speed of rotation. Thse results implied that for the LLDs there was a nonlinguistic cognitive deficit affecting mental rotation that could not be attributed to perceptual skill, or to response speed.    There was a relationship between severity of language learning disability and accuracy on mental rotation tasks. Mental rotation ability was found to be related to vocabulary development and to syntactical and morphological abilities in expressive and receptive language. Significant relationships between age and rotational accuracy scores suggested that mental rotation skill were still developing.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

In children mental rotation can be trained by extensive repetition of the task, but the improvement seems to rely on the retrieval of previously learned stimuli. We assumed that due to the close relation between mental and manual rotation in children a manual training should improve the mental rotation process itself. The manual training we developed indeed ameliorated mental rotation and the training effect was not limited to learned stimuli. While boys outperformed girls in the mental rotation test before the manual rotation training, we found no gender differences in the results of the manual rotation task. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Developmental neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1080/87565640701539626	We investigated the mental rotation ability of children with spina bifida, a malformation of the spinal cord due to a neural tube defect, and how it is  influenced by a manual rotation training. In comparison to a healthy control group  these children showed longer reaction times and a higher number of errors in a  computer-based mental rotation test. Furthermore, a manual rotation training was  applied. The spina bifida group benefited considerably from the manual rotation  training. The training effect was not limited to stimuli learned in the training.  While the children with spina bifida showed a lower speed of mental rotation than  their healthy peers in the mental rotation pretest, the two groups did not differ in  their mental rotation speed in the posttest.

Early childhood has been shown to be a very important time in a child's development of spatial skills and it is also known that certain types of interventions can help children develop higher levels of spatial ability. However, teaching young children comes with unique challenges, such as Developmentally Appropriate teaching and open-ended instruction and play. We propose that an Intelligent Tutoring System might be useful to address these challenges and present an initial research plan to design one to teach young children spatial skills in a Developmentally Appropriate, open-ended play-based manner. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Professional applications of GIS have been in place since the 1980's, but only recently has GIS gained significant attention in the K–12 classroom. Students using GIS are able to manipulate and query data in order to solve all manners of spatial problems. Very few studies have examined how this technological innovation can support classroom learning. In particular, there has been little research on how experience in using the software correlates with a child's spatial cognition and his/her ability to understand spatial relationships.    This study investigates the strategies used by middle school students to solve a wayfinding (route-finding) problem using the ArcView GIS software. The research design combined an individual background questionnaire, results from the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking (GALT) test, and analysis of reflective think-aloud sessions to define the characteristics of the strategies students' used to solve this particular class of spatial problem. Three uniquely different spatial problem solving strategies were identified. Visual/Concrete Wayfinders used a highly visual strategy; Logical/Abstract Wayfinders used GIS software tools to apply a more analytical and systematic approach; Transitional Wayfinders used an approach that showed evidence of one that was shifting from a visual strategy to one that was more analytical.    The triangulation of data sources indicates that this progression of wayfinding strategy can be correlated both to Piagetian stages of logical thought and to experience with the use of maps. These findings suggest that GIS teachers must be aware that their students' performance will lie on a continuum that is based on cognitive development, spatial ability, and prior experience with maps. To be most effective, GIS teaching strategies and curriculum development should also represent a progression that correlates to the learners' current skills and experience.

Participants were 400 four-year olds from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds. Children's patterning and numerical ability were assessed by means of individual tasks. The patterning tasks assessed their performance on three patterning activities (i.e., extending, translating, and identifying the pattern's structure) for two types of patterns (i.e., repeating and growing). The numerical measure included a set of eight well-known numerical tasks. We additionally controlled for individual differences in spatial ability and visuospatial working memory. Results indicated an effect of both activity and patterning type on children's patterning performance, as well as an interaction between both. Furthermore, children's performance on four out of six patterning tasks uniquely contributed to their numerical ability above age, spatial ability, and visuospatial working memory. These findings support the importance of specific pattern types and patterning activities in the early stage of children's mathematical development and give directions for further educational practices. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The British journal of educational psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12329	BACKGROUND: Early patterning competence has recently been identified as an important precursor of mathematical development. Whereas the focus of this research has been  on children's ability regarding repeating patterns, children might also differ in  their spontaneous attention to patterns. AIMS: The present study aimed to explore 4-  to 5-year olds' Spontaneous Focusing On Patterns (SFOP) and its association with  their patterning and mathematical ability. SAMPLE: Participants were 378 children  (M(age)  = 4 years 10 months; 191 boys) from 17 preschools. METHODS: Spontaneous  Focusing On Patterns was measured with a construction task in which children had to  build a tower with 15 blocks of three different colours. The constructions of the  children were grouped into three categories (i.e., pattern, random, and sorting). We  additionally administered tasks assessing their patterning ability, mathematical  ability, spatial ability, and visuospatial working memory. RESULTS: When building a  tower, 37% of the preschoolers spontaneously created a pattern, 49% made a random  construction, and 14% sorted the blocks per colour. Preschoolers who spontaneously  created a pattern had better patterning and mathematical ability than children in  the random group. Group differences in patterning ability and spatial skills  accounted for the difference in mathematical ability. CONCLUSIONS: The current data  suggest that children's spontaneous attention to patterns is an important component  of their mathematical ability. Children's spontaneous pattern constructions may  provide opportunities to discuss and practice patterns in preschool settings or at  home, but more research is required to further analyse the role of SFOP in early  mathematical development.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13490	The present study aimed to analyze the direction of the associations between repeating patterning, growing patterning, and numerical ability. Participants were  410 children who were annually assessed on their repeating patterning, growing  patterning, and numerical ability, at ages 4, 5, and 6 years (i.e., spring 2017,  2018, and 2019). A cross-lagged panel model identified bidirectional associations  between all three abilities from ages 4 to 5 years while taking into account spatial  skills. From ages 5 to 6 years, both patterning abilities predicted later numerical  ability, but the reverse was no longer true. Associations between performances on  both pattern types also disappeared. Results highlight the unique associations  between repeating patterning, growing patterning, and numerical ability, above  spatial skills.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

However, diagnostic criteria have not yet been defined for NVLD. As a result, children with the disability are often under-identified. Some discrepancies exist in current theories of NVLD, and this study aimed to address some of the discrepancies and aid in identifying possible diagnostic criteria. In particular, this study examined motor speed and tactile perception in children and adolescents with NVLD.   This investigation reviews existing literature on NVLD, including developmental information, as well as the Rourke model of NVLD (Harnadek, & Rourke, 1994, Rourke, 1993). In addition, empirical evidence is reviewed which suggests that NVLD is related to dysfunction of the right hemisphere of the brain. The relationship between NVLD and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is also described. Finally, a review of the nature of motor speed and tactile perception is provided.   Various psychoeducational and neuropsychological measures were utilized in this study to identify eligible participants. Three groups of participants between the ages of 9 and 14 were identified for this study: (1) Children with suspected NVLD based on deficits in two out of three areas (social perception, mathematics, and visual-spatial skills), (2) Children with significant symptoms of inattention, and (3) Typically developing children. The groups were compared on several neuropsychological measures of motor speed and tactile perception.   The results of this study suggest that measures of motor speed may not be useful in identifying children with NVLD. In addition, although measures of tactile perception may be helpful in diagnosing NVLD, performance on these measures should be considered only in conjunction with other deficits. Finally, measures of the integration of motor speed and tactile perception may not be extremely useful in identifying possible NVLD. Therefore, further research is needed to deliniate potential diagnostic criteria of NVLD, so that children with the disability can be identified and can receive appropriate interventions.

These modalities can provide sub millimetre accuracy, delivering high radiation dose to the tumour and reduced dose to the surrounding normal anatomy. Building a mental model of the size, shape and position of the tumour in relation to the surrounding anatomy and proposed radiation beam direction requires radiotherapy radiographers to have well developed three- spatial visualisation skills. The introduction of the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training (Vertual Ltd, Hull, United Kingdom), an immersive 3-D visualisation platform in 2007, offered the potential for developing new ways of supporting the development of these visualisation skills in pre-registration radiotherapy learners in a simulated environment. Aims: This programme of research aimed to measure the baseline three dimensional spatial visualisation skills of new radiotherapy learners, to compare their performance with new learners in diagnostic imaging, to determine if 3-D visualisation skills could develop over time and to identify those learners most likely to benefit from learning in the virtual environment for radiotherapy training. Methods: This programme of research employed a QUANT + qual mixed model approach with purposive convenience sampling of year one diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy students to develop an online, three-dimensional spatial visualisation test using objects from two traditional paper based spatial visualisation tests for mental rotation and cross sectional visual perception (the pilot phase). The experimental phase employed an online test platform in a controlled, single subject design, longitudinal study using a second cohort of students to determine their 3-D spatial visualisation skill at the start of their pre-registration radiography programme and to track any change over three additional time points during an 18-month period between the start of year one and the end of year two. For the radiotherapy cohort, the relationship between baseline spatial visualisation skill and patient positioning performance was investigated using a simulated treatment delivery task conducted within the Virtual Environment for Radiotherapy Training. Results: The pilot phase comparison of performance scores for the paper based and online versions of the three-dimensional spatial visualisation test did not produce statistically significant differences, suggesting that a move to an online test platform would not disadvantage any participant. Results from the experimental phase (study four) identified that the baseline 3-D spatial visualisation skill of 54 pre-registration learners in radiotherapy (n = 15) and diagnostic imaging (n = 39) could be measured and performance classified as being low, intermediate or high at the start of their radiography education. Across both pathways, 13 participants (24%) were identified as having low skill, 36 (67%) were intermediate and 5 (9%). Performance gains were observed in the growth trajectory for mean spatial visualisation test score over the 18 month time period for both pathways. Analysis of performance in the mental rotation and cross section subcomponents indicated that one third of all participants might benefit from additional support in mental rotation or perception of cross sections. For the radiotherapy positioning task, correlations between task performance metrics for task completion time, number of equipment adjustments and set up accuracy and baseline demonstrated a weak positive relationship meaning that the results were inconclusive. Conclusions and contributions to knowledge: The measurement of 3-D spatial visualisation subcomponent performance as a surrogate for accurate patient positioning and beam alignment has provided an enhanced understanding of baseline visualisation skill. Analysis of these subcomponents, with an emphasis on patterns of incorrect answers, in addition to overall performance score provides a method for identifying those individuals with less well-developed skills. These are the learners who may have difficulty with mental model and relationship building and would benefit from the additional support of focused tutorials with personalised spatial visualisation syllabus activities. This enhanced understanding will provide opportunities for the development of the spatial visualisation syllabus beyond the often opportunistic, and ad-hoc structure of clinical practice and a one-size fits all approach to campus based simulation and visualisation activities.

This study aimed to provide a greater understanding of motor imagery ability in children with hemiplegia using the hand rotation task. Three groups of children, aged 8-12 years, participated: right hemiplegia (R-HEMI; N= 21), left hemiplegia (L-HEMI; N= 19) and comparisons (N= 21). All groups conformed to biomechanical limitations of the task, supporting the use of motor imagery, and all showed the expected response-time trade-off for angle. The general slowing of responses in the HEMI groups did not reach significance compared to their peers. The L-HEMI group were less accurate than the comparison group while the R-HEMI group were more variable in their performance. These results appeared to be linked to functional level. Using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite, children were classified as low or normal functioning - of the seven classified as low function, six were in the L-HEMI group. Accuracy was lower in the low function subgroup, but this failed to reach significance with an adjusted critical value. However, there was a strong correlation between function level and mean accuracy. This indicates that motor imagery performance may be more closely linked to function level than to the neural hemisphere that has been damaged in cases of congenital hemiplegia. Function level may be linked to the site or extent of neural damage or the level of cortical reorganisation experienced and more attention should be paid to neural factors in future research. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Child: care, health and development	https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00688.x	AIM: This study aimed to test the internal modelling deficit (IMD) hypothesis using the mental rotation paradigm. BACKGROUND: According to the IMD hypothesis, children  with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have an impaired ability to  internally represent action. Thirty-six children (18 DCD) completed four tasks: two  versions of a single-hand rotation task (with and without explicit imagery  instructions), a whole-body imagery task and an alphanumeric rotation task. RESULTS:  There was partial support for the hypothesis that children with DCD would display an  atypical pattern of performance on the hand rotation task, requiring implicit use of  motor imagery. Overall, there were no significant differences between the DCD and  control groups when the hand task was completed without explicit instructions, on  either response time or accuracy. However, when imagery instructions were  introduced, the controls were significantly more accurate than the DCD group,  indicating that children with DCD were unable to benefit from explicit cuing. As  predicted, the controls were also significantly more accurate than the DCD group on  the whole-body task, with the accuracy of the DCD group barely rising above chance.  Finally, and as expected, there was no difference between the groups on the  alphanumeric task, a measure of visual (or object-related) imagery. CONCLUSIONS: The  inability of the DCD group to utilize specific motor imagery instructions and to  perform egocentric transformations lends some support to the IMD hypothesis. Future  work needs to address the question of whether the IMD itself is subgroup-specific.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Specifically, it explored whether children with varying degrees of motor impairment differed in their ability to perform motor imagery tasks. Fourty-two children scoring below the 15th percentile on the Movement ABC were split into two groups - DCD severe (DCD-S), scoring on or below the 5th percentile, and DCD mild (DCD-M), scoring from the 6th to 15th percentiles - and compared to 21 age matched controls. Participants performed two motor imagery tasks - hand (performed without and with specific imagery instructions) and whole-body rotation. The results demonstrated that children in the DCD-S group had a generalized motor imagery deficit in that they were less accurate across tasks than controls (and the DCD-M group on the hand task) and showed little benefit when given specific imagery instructions. The DCD-M group appeared capable of performing simpler motor imagery transformations, but were less successful as task complexity increased. Unlike the DCD-S group, the DCD-M group did show some benefit from specific imagery instructions with increases in accuracy on the hand task. These results suggest that a motor imagery deficit does exist in many children with DCD but that its presentation can vary - factors such as the individual child's level of motor impairment and task complexity appear to be linked to the profile of deficits observed, which could explain the inconsistent findings of previous studies. Although this study lends support to the theory that a deficit in internal modeling is an underlying problem for children with DCD, still more research is required to develop the theory further. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Cochrane database of systematic reviews	https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD003495.pub2	BACKGROUND: Secretin is a gastro-intestinal hormone which has been presented as an effective treatment for autism based on anecdotal evidence. OBJECTIVES: To determine  if intravenous secretin:1. improves the core features of autism (social interaction,  communication and behaviour problems); 2. improves the non-core aspects of behaviour  or function such as self injurious behaviour;3. improves the quality of life of  affected individuals and their carers; 4. has short term and long term effects on  outcome; 5. causes harm. SEARCH STRATEGY: Results of electronic searches of CENTRAL,  MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, HealthStar and Sociofile (1998 - March  2005) were independently examined by two authors. Reference lists of trials and  reviews were searched; experts and trialists were contacted to find unpublished  studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of intravenous secretin  comparing secretin with a placebo treatment in children or adults diagnosed with  autism spectrum disorders, where at least one standardised outcome measure was  reported. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria. All  outcome data were continuous. Where trials used cross-over designs, analysis was  conducted on results from first treatment phase, allowing combined analysis with  parallel design trials. Where standardised assessment tools generated scores as  outcome measures, comparisons were made between means of these scores. Where  baseline means were reported, differences between treatment and control were  determined to assess possible bias. Where mean change from baseline was reported,  this was used in preference to post-treatment scores for meta-analyses or forest  plots. As meta-analysis was possible for only one outcome (Childhood Autism Rating  Scale), it was impossible to use sensitivity or subgroup analyses to assess impact  of study quality, clinical differences in the intervention, or clinically relevant  differences between groups, such as age or presence of gastrointestinal symptoms.  MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-five established standardised outcome measures were reported to  assess core features of autism, communication, behaviour, visio-spatial skills,  affect and adverse events within fourteen included studies. No more than four  studies used any one outcome measure similarly. Outcomes were reported between three  and six weeks. RCTs of efficacy of secretin in autism have not shown improvements  for core features of autism. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that single  or multiple dose intravenous secretin is effective and as such it should not  currently be recommended or administered as a treatment for autism. Further  experimental assessment of secretin's effectiveness for autism can only be justified  if methodological problems of existing research can be overcome.

The purpose of this investigation was to combine the study of personal characteristics and early socialization factors with typicalness of career choice and achievement in a study of active professional women. The study was designed to collect information on the subject's current status as well as her memories of childhood experiences. Three variables were selected for assessing current status: cognitive (verbal and spatial) ability, sex typing and achievement motivation. Instruments used for this component of the study were: the Vocabularly and Block Design subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, and Atkinson's measure of achievement motivation.    Two major career fields, medicine and law, were selected for the study. Four categories within each field were established according to two criteria:  (a) level of career success, and (b) typicalness of the occupation for females. The four categories within each field ranged from very atypical (high success in an atypical career) to very traditional occupations for females. Ten subjects were selected for each job category for a total of 80 subjects.    It was expected that women in atypical, relative to those in typical, professions would (a) score higher on both the verbal and spatial intellectual measures, (b) score relatively higher on the spatial measure, (c) show a lower degree of traditional female sex typing, and (d) score higher in achievement motivation. It was expected that within categories 1 and 2, law and medicine would show different patterns of verbal and spatial ability with a higher performance on the Vocabulary subtest for lawyers and a higher performance on the spatial measure for physicians. It was also expected that the high success category would show a higher level of cross-sex typing and score higher in achievement motivation than other subjects.    A questionnaire developed in conjunction with the study was used to tap four aspects of the subject's childhood experiences: her personal characteristics, characteristics of her parents, memory of her parents' childrearing practices, and play materials and activities during childhood.    Findings and Conclusions. Subjects in atypical, relative to those in typical, careers were found to score higher on cognitive measures, psychological masculinity, and, in law, achievement motivation. Childhood experiences of women in atypical career included: a higher level of education than their siblings, a greater likelihood of being a first born or only child, greater personal unhappiness during adolescence, more highly educated parents, and a greater likelihood of father's employment in a managerial or professional job category. Subjects in atypical categories (1 and 2) were less likely to have been required to perform housekeeping tasks during adolescence and the nature of their responsibility was more likely to have been nontraditional. Differences were reported for preferred and available play materials and activities. Subjects in atypical careers preferred sports activities and table games and were less likely to report having owned a doll, while subjects in typical careers were more likely to have preferred playing house as a play activity. Interview data reiterated these basic themes of the subjects preference for, and parental tolerance of, nontraditionally feminine activities and familial support of diverse achievement efforts.

Fifty-six children between 3- to 10-years-old completed a comprehensive battery of cognitive tasks that tapped 8 components of visual-spatial functioning. Results demonstrate that task complexity and age interact across the majority of visual-spatial sub-domains, with visual-spatial competencies increasing linearly with age. Examination of acquisition rates showed that after 8 years of age children are capable of performing each measure significantly better than chance. Gender-age-related findings suggest males demonstrate superior visual-spatial mental rotation skills only until 9-10 years of age, than females begin to surpass males. Visual-spatial cognition and mathematical performance was also investigated in typical children. Children's visual-spatial mental rotation and manipulation and visual-spatial directionality abilities were positively correlated with mathematical performance.

Part I reviews the evidence for a biological basis for behavioural sex differences. It concludes that the superior visuo-spatial ability of boys may be under genetic control and that their greater propensity for physical activity might be associated with androgen levels. Part II assesses whether consistent differences in the social environments of boys and girls could cause sex-role differences. It suggested that mothers worked to the motto—'Boys will be boys, but girls must be little ladies'. The most influential psychological theories are reviewed in Part III5 to assess the extent to which they can explain the early development of sex-roles. The main conclusions from the first three parts take the form of recommendations for a different approach to the psychological study of young children. Part IV reports two experiments based mainly in the laboratory which attempt to follow these recommendations. The first developed a methodology and concluded tentatively that the way in which a mother treats her second child aged 18–24 months depends on the sex of her first born. Those with an elder son were more likely to try to emphasised their son's achievements. The main experiment, studying mothers with first or second born children aged 1/2–2 years, was designed to amplify the results of the first. It showed that both boys and their mothers avoided play with 'feminine' toys; that mothers showed more evidence of trying to display their sons' achievements, regardless of the sex, or existence of, an elder sibling; that mothers with a first born boy touched the toys more than others; and that if the children could speak they could identify the sex of pictured people, but that the girls in particular showed a male bias in their responses.

Handling resulted in increased activity, decreased CORT levels, and impaired spatial learning ability. Isolation failed to alter activity levels, impaired spatial ability, and increased CORT levels in females, and reduced them in males. Combining the two manipulations produced no changes in behavior or CORT levels. The results are discussed in terms of altering the manner in which the animals respond to environmental challenges.

Developmental medicine and child neurology	https://doi.org/10.1017/s001216220400129x	Recent studies show that children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have difficulties in generating an accurate visuospatial representation of an  intended action, which are shown by deficits in motor imagery. This study sought to  test this hypothesis further using a mental rotation paradigm. It was predicted that  children with DCD would not conform to the typical pattern of responding when  required to imagine movement of their limbs. Participants included 16 children with  DCD and 18 control children; mean age for the DCD group was 10 years 4 months, and  for controls 10 years. The task required children to judge the handedness of  single-hand images that were presented at angles between 0 degrees and 180 degrees  at 45 degrees intervals in either direction. Results were broadly consistent with  the hypothesis above. Responses of the control children conformed to the typical  pattern of mental rotation: a moderate trade-off between response time and angle of  rotation. The response pattern for the DCD group was less typical, with a small  trade-off function. Response accuracy did not differ between groups. It was  suggested that children with DCD, unlike controls, do not automatically enlist motor  imagery when performing mental rotation, but rely on an alternative object-based  strategy that preserves speed and accuracy. This occurs because these children  manifest a reduced ability to make imagined transformations from an egocentric or  first-person perspective.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1
database	Wilson, R.G.	1990	thesis	Gender differences in intelligence personality and primary mental abilities among Irish children (BL)		https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/gender-differences-intelligence-personality/docview/301525813/se-2?accountid=11531	Approximately 1200 children from the Irish Republic were tested for verbal and spatial ability and attainment in Irish (taught as a second language), personality traits of psychoticism, neuroticism, extraversion and attitude towards learning foreign languages. The findings are discussed in four parts.1. Females performed better on the verbal tests and Irish test. Males did not perform significantly better on any of the cognitive tests. The female superiority at Irish increased until the age of 11 and then decreased again with progression through secondary school. The finding that females were consistently better than males at Irish is inconsistent with official examination statistics which indicate that males out perform females. It is suggested that males may be more motivated to excel at Irish due to the fact that it is associated with Irish culture. As males tend to be more aggressive than females, they could tend to play a more active role in political issues. The Irish attainment was the only test where there was a marked change in magnitude of sex difference with age. It is suggested that this is related to maturation differences.2. Factor analysis reveals the existence of three separate primary abilities: Verbal, Spatial and Foreign Language. The three abilities, although distinct, correlate moderately with each other, which indicates that they are related. The results indicate that foreign language ability is a separate primary.3. Females had a significantly higher N score and had a significantly more positive attitude towards learning second languages, and males had a significantly higher P score. The personality measures were not strongly related to the cognitive measures. There were low but positive correlations between attitude towards foreign language learning and the total score obtained in the Irish test. Attitude towards learning foreign languages also had low but significant correlations with some of the other cognitive tests eg English Spelling and Verbal Fluency Test. Age does not appear to influence personality measures during this period of childhood and adolescence.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

A linear increase in response time with rotation angle emerged at 6-years, suggesting that spatial properties are represented in children’s mental images. Moreover, 6-, 8-, and 10-year-olds, but not 4-year-olds or adults, took longer to respond to rotated stimuli pairs when gravity information was incongruent with the direction of rotation rather than congruent. Overall, findings suggest that in contrast to adults’, 6- to 10-year-olds’ mental rotation performance was penetrated by top-down information. This research (a) provides insight into the format of young children’s mental images and (b) shows that children’s mental rotation performance is penetrable by top-down influences. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

PloS one	https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0171762	The development and relation of mental scanning and mental rotation were examined in 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-year old children and adults (N = 102). Based on previous findings  from adults and ageing populations, the key question was whether they develop as a  set of related abilities and become increasingly differentiated or are unrelated  abilities per se. Findings revealed that both mental scanning and rotation abilities  develop between 4- and 6 years of age. Specifically, 4-year-olds showed no  difference in accuracy of mental scanning and no scanning trials whereas all older  children and adults made more errors in scanning trials. Additionally, the minority  of 4-year-olds showed a linear increase in response time with increasing rotation  angle difference of two stimuli in contrast to all older participants. Despite  similar developmental trajectories, mental scanning and rotation performances were  unrelated. Thus, adding to research findings from adults, mental scanning and  rotation appear to develop as a set of unrelated abilities from the outset.  Different underlying abilities such as visual working memory and spatial coding  versus representing past and future events are discussed.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Group differences were apparent, with a key finding that the LI group was observably slower than both typical groups in mental rotation and arithmetic, and also slower than the typical monolingual group in odd man out, pattern matching, and form completion. Overall, the response time (RT) increased equivalently across groups as task difficulty increased. Chronological age and perceptualmotor speed contributed to task performance, especially for the shorter tasks. RT trajectories across the 6-year age span showed that task RT decreased with age, but with greater variability for longer tasks that may also be more vulnerable to the effect of experience. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.

This paper compares the usual method, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), with another method, hierarchical linear modeling with random coefficients (HLM). The analyses used available response time (RT) data from studies of perceptual-motor, cognitive, and language skills of LI and chronological-age-matched (CA) groups. The data set included RT measures from 25 studies investigating 20 different tasks (e.g., auditory detection, mental rotation, and word recognition tasks). OLS and HLM analyses of the RT data yielded very different results. OLS supported general slowing for the LI groups, and indicated that they were significantly slower than CA groups across studies by an overall estimate of 10%. HLM indicated a larger average extent of LI slowing (18%). However, the variability around this average was much greater than that yielded by OLS, and the extent of slowing was not statistically significant. Importantly, HLM showed a significant difference in the RT relation between LI and CA groups across studies, indicating that study-specific slowing, rather than general slowing across studies, was present. A separate HIM analysis of two types of language tasks, picture naming and word recognition, was performed. Although the extent of slowing was equivalent across these tasks, the slowing was minimal (2%) and not significant. Methodological limitations of each analysis to assess general slowing are highlighted.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

In this future, code provides the “brush” that enables the expression of artistic ideas and mathematical structures in digital and digitally-fabricated mediums. This educational idea is motivated by (1) literature supporting the position that visual thinking and spatial reasoning significantly impact STEAM disciplines, and (2) Piaget's theory of cognitive development in which children, in the concrete operational stage, solve problems relating to physical objects (i.e., they learn-by-making). A project is then described involving the creation of a 3D artifact we call a Wunderlich cube — a mathematical artifact that embodies numerous spatial reasoning puzzles. An understanding of the properties of the Wunderlich cube is developed through manual construction using LEGO®, mathematical analysis, computational thinking, coding, and 3D printing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP	https://doi.org/10.1097/00004703-200004000-00004	This study examined skill differences at 5 years of age for very preterm children who were or were not cooperative with developmental testing at 3 years of age. All  children born between 1986 and 1991 who were less than 30 weeks of gestation were  followed prospectively. Two hundred one children were seen at both the 3- and 5-year  assessments. Of the 201 children, 24 (11.9%) who had been uncooperative in the  assessment at 3 years were seen at 5 years. Uncooperative children were matched to a  group of cooperative children for sex, gestation, and/or birth weight. Nonparametric  analyses revealed that scores on the Binet Pattern Analysis (p < .01) and the Bead  Memory (p < .01) subtests were significantly different between the groups. The  uncooperative children scored significantly more often in the at-risk range for  tests of minor neurological dysfunction (MND; p < .01) compared with cooperative  matched controls. The authors speculate that in very preterm children, uncooperative  behavior shown at 3 years of age associated with poor visual/spatial skills and a  high level of MND at 5 years of age may reveal children at risk for the development  of nonverbal learning disabilities.

The roles of gender and affective factors are also unclear. This study examined the correlations between counting ability, mental transformation, and targeting accuracy in 182 Hong Kong preschoolers, and whether these relationships were weaker at higher spatial anxiety levels. Both spatial abilities related with counting similarly for boys and girls. Targeting accuracy also mediated the male advantage in counting. Interestingly, spatial anxiety moderated the space-math links, but differently for boys and girls. For boys, spatial abilities were irrelevant to counting at high anxiety levels; for girls, the role of anxiety on the space-math link is less clear. Results extend the evidence base of the space-math link to include an extrinsic spatial ability (targeting accuracy) and have implications for intervention programmes. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Much evidence of a space-math link in adolescent and adult samples and for intrinsic spatial abilities. What does this study add? Extended the space-math link to include both intrinsic and extrinsic spatial abilities in a preschool sample.

Archives of Sexual Behavior	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-012-9997-4	Influences of prenatal androgen exposure on human sex-typical behavior have been established largely through studies of individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). However, evidence that addresses the potential confounding influence of parental socialization is limited. Parental socialization and its relationship to sex-typical toy play and spatial ability were investigated in two samples involving 137 individuals with CAH and 107 healthy controls. Females with CAH showed more boy-typical toy play and better targeting performance than control females, but did not differ in mental rotations performance. Males with CAH showed worse mental rotations performance than control males, but did not differ in sex-typical toy play or targeting. Reported parental encouragement of girl-typical toy play correlated with girl-typical toy play in all four groups. Moreover, parents reported encouraging less girl-typical, and more boy-typical, toy play in females with CAH than in control females and this reported encouragement partially mediated the relationship between CAH status and sex-typical toy play. Other evidence suggests that the reported parental encouragement of sex-atypical toy play in girls with CAH may be a response to the girls' preferences for boys' toys. Nevertheless, this encouragement could further increase boy-typical behavior in girls with CAH. In contrast to the results for toy play, we found no differential parental socialization for spatial activities and little evidence linking parental socialization to spatial ability. Overall, evidence suggests that prenatal androgen exposure and parental socialization both contribute to sex-typical toy play. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Archives of sexual behavior	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-019-1415-8	Children's play preferences are highly gender-typed. At the same time, much research revolves around spatial and social skills that sometimes show male and female  advantages, respectively. There is evidence that play with masculine toys is  associated with better spatial skills and emerging evidence suggests that play with  feminine toys is associated with better social skills. However, several research  gaps limit current knowledge on these aspects of gender development. First, the  study of childhood gender development has been largely Eurocentric; second, the link  between gender-typed play and social skills development is not well supported. We  tested 644 5-year-old Hong Kong Chinese children on five gender-typed skills, play  preferences, and parental gender socialization. The pattern of gender differences  was remarkably similar to those in the West. Boys preferred masculine toys more than  girls and were better at mental transformation and targeting accuracy, while girls  preferred feminine (and neutral) toys more than boys and were better at empathy and  were less aggressive, although there was no significant gender difference in  comforting skill. There was little evidence that these gender differences varied  with socioeconomic status (parental income and education). Play correlated with some  outcomes in expected ways. This is in contrast to parents' gender socialization,  which showed some expected differences by child gender but minimally correlated with  children's skills. These findings shed light on the generalizability of current  knowledge on early gender differences and may facilitate gender developmental  research outside the West. Although the study did not test the direction of effects,  they substantiate the growing discourse on gender-typed play as an important  learning mechanism.

There has been no comprehensive analysis, however, of how studies based on spatial reasoning interventions may lead to improvements in students’ mathematics learning in school classroom environments. This article considers 18 studies selected from a combined systematic literature review of 133 studies, from Scopus and Education Research Complete (ERC) using PRISMA, and 23 studies recommended by the research team from bibliographies of major international research centres with a spatial reasoning dedication. This combination approach has allowed a synthesis of research and practice in an analytical way, assisting construction of a framework for spatial reasoning interventions for consideration in developing core knowledge and skills within the primary school mathematics curriculum. The findings highlight the importance of designing and evaluating spatial reasoning programs for primary school children in order to improve students’ mathematics classroom learning, including evidence from standardized tests, as they progress through the school system. The article supports the need for further research on interventions that provide sustainable school-based spatial reasoning programs. © 2020, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8624.00437	Possession of a "theory of mind" (ToM)--as demonstrated by an understanding of the false beliefs of others--is fundamental in children's cognitive development. A key  question for debate concerns the effect of language input on ToM. In this respect,  comparisons of deaf native-signing children who are raised by deaf signing parents  with deaf late-signing children who are raised by hearing parents provide a critical  test. This article reports on two studies (N = 100 and N = 39) using "thought  picture" measures of ToM that minimize verbal task-performance requirements. These  studies demonstrated that even when factors such as syntax ability, mental age in  spatial ability, and executive functioning were considered, deaf late signers still  showed deficits in ToM understanding relative to deaf native signers or hearing  controls. Even though the native signers were significantly younger than a sample of  late signers matched for spatial mental age and scores on a test of receptive sign  language ability, native signers outperformed late signers on pictorial ToM tasks.  The results are discussed in terms of access to conversation and extralinguistic  influences on development such as the presence of sibling relationships, and suggest  that the expression of a ToM is the end result of social understanding mediated by  early conversational experience.

Domains analysed included cognition and executive function, social and emotional well-being, adaptive behaviour, academic achievement, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Method: Twenty-one participants (10 males, 11 females) ranged in age from 14 to 17 years (mean 15y 4.8mo, SD 8.4mo). Twenty had biventricular repairs. All were classified as New York Heart Association class I. Measures included: Wechsler Intelligence and Achievement scales; Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, Second Edition; California Verbal Learning Test – Children's Version; Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function; Conners, Third Edition; Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition; Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition; Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure; and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Results: Outcomes were significantly lower (p≤0.01) than population norms for processing speed, mathematical achievement, attention, and visual–spatial ability. Participants reported more frequent learning problems but more positive family relations. HRQoL was significantly lower across most domains by self- and parent-proxy report. Interpretation: Individuals with CHD may experience difficulties across a range of domains. These findings emphasize the importance of comprehensive screening, early intervention, and long-term follow-up, as deficits may extend into young adulthood.

FASD is often conceptualized as static and permanent, but interventions that capitalize on brain plasticity and critical developmental windows are emerging. We present a long-term follow-up study evaluating the neurodevelopmental effects of choline supplementation in children with FASD 4 years after an initial efficacy trial. Methods: The initial study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of choline vs. placebo in 2-5-year-olds with FASD. Participants include 31 children (16 placebo; 15 choline) seen 4 years after trial completion. The mean age at follow-up was 8.6 years. Diagnoses were 12.9% fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), 41.9% partial FAS, and 45.1% alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder. The follow-up included measures of intelligence, memory, executive functioning, and behavior. Results: Children who received choline had higher non-verbal intelligence, higher visual-spatial skill, higher working memory ability, better verbal memory, and fewer behavioral symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder than the placebo group. No differences were seen for verbal intelligence, visual memory, or other executive functions. Conclusions: These data support choline as a potential neurodevelopmental intervention for FASD and highlight the need for long-term follow-up to capture treatment effects on neurodevelopmental trajectories.

The interdisciplinary team structured the workshops to facilitate computer skill development as well as social interaction. Qualitative analysis involved thematic analysis of transcripts from focus groups with parents and grandparents. The two key themes that emerged were as follows: (i) reframing expectations (parental efficacy and creating a safe environment) and (ii) building intergenerational bridges among parents, children, siblings, and grandparents.

Regression and cluster analyses were used to identify dyslexic groups in a sample of 416 school children followed longitudinally from age eight to age thirteen. Concordance between the two methods at age eight was high, 95% of the dyslexics identified by regression were identified by cluster analysis. At age thirteen concordance was lower between the two techniques, with 67% of those identified by regression also identified by cluster analysis. Using each technique, three separate groups of dyslexics were identified. A stable group who were identified as dyslexic at both ages, a transient group who were identified as dyslexic only at age eight and a 'late developing' group who were identified as dyslexic at age thirteen but not at age eight. Six factors were derived from a cognitive and neuropsychological battery. These were interpreted as measuring: Visual and auditory memory and motor skills, Handedness, Spatial ability. Sequencing ability, Memory and Left right discrimination. Performance on three of these factors: Sequencing, Left-right discrimination and Visual-perceptual memory, differentiated the dyslexics and controls and contributed significantly to both the concurrent and future prediction of reading achievement. Results of a two factor (dyslexic vs non-dyslexic by Time) multivariate analysis of variance indicated that the reading performance of dyslexics, defined by both techniques, improved at a faster rate than that of controls over the five year period.  Dyslexic readers, however, did not approach the levels of performance of the non dyslexics at either age. For measures of spelling and Verbal IQ, the rate of development was found to be similar for both groups. Prediction of later reading achievement was found to be as accurate as current prediction. Stepwise multiple regression equations indicated that at age eight a subset of cognitive variables and age accounted for 45%, 39%, 41% and 53%, respectively, of the variance in Schonell Reading, Schonell Spelling, Neale Accuracy and Comprehension. At age thirteen, the same variables, excluding age and including a measure of attention, accounted for 44% of the variance in Schonell Reading and 44% in Schonell Spelling. The best predictor of later reading was prose reading at age eight. When this measure was included in the analysis, the other cognitive variables contributed only small amounts of additional variance.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Nets are one way to connect three-dimensional shapes and their two-dimensional representations and are a common focus of geometry curricula. Thirty-four students at year 6 (upper primary school) were interviewed on two occasions about their anticipation of whether or not given nets for the cube- and square-based pyramid would fold to form the target solid. Vergnaud’s (Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 17(2), 167–181, 1998, Human Development, 52, 83–94, 2009) four characteristics of schemes were used as a theoretical lens to analyse the data. Successful schemes depended on the interaction of operational invariants, such as strategic choice of the base, rules for action, particularly rotation of shapes, and anticipations of composites of polygons in the net forming arrangements of faces in the solid. Inferences were rare. These data suggest that students need teacher support to make inferences, in order to create transferable schemes. © 2017, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568439	Paper folding is a common activity in East Asian kindergartens, but its potential value to early spatial skills have not been empirically explored. This study aims to  investigate whether and how paper folding skills can predict spatial ability (SA) in  the early years. Altogether 101 preschoolers (N(girl) = 45, M (age) = 4.54, SD =  0.75) were randomly sampled from two Hong Kong kindergartens and invited to complete  the map-use and the paper folding tasks. The paper folding task taps two levels of  children's paper folding skills: Basic Folding Skill (BFS) and Advanced Folding  Skill (AFS). The parents reported the demographic information and their involvement  in spatial activities at home. The results indicated the following: (1) there was a  significant age-related increase in the paper folding performance; (2) child age  could significantly predict both BFS (β = 0.551, p < 0.001) and AFS (β = 0.627, p <  0.001), while parental involvement could only predict BFS (β = 0.246, p < 0.001);  (3) after controlling for confounders, paper folding skills could significantly  predict SA as measured by the map-use task; (4) BFS was found to mediate the  relationship between parental involvement and SA. The educational implications of  these findings are also discussed.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

An explorative study	Current Psychology	https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-020-01190-5	It is well known that sports and mathematical abilities are related to spatial abilities, also a relation between sport and mathematical abilities is assumed. However, the relation between all three aspects has not been investigated until now. Therefore, the main goal of the study is to examine the relationship between sport, spatial and mathematical ability in elementary school aged children. 50 boys and 42 girls from third grade solved spatial and sport tasks, which can be differentiated into the following: intrinsic-dynamic, intrinsic-static and extrinsic-static. Furthermore, their performances in mathematical (separated into numerical/arithmetical and geometrical) abilities were analyzed. The results showed significant correlations between the static spatial and sporting activities. This correlation is due to the strong correlation within the group of girls. Furthermore, a good performance in the intrinsic-spatial ability was related to a high geometrical ability of the children, especially in boys. However, the geometrical ability could not be predicted by sport abilities. © 2020, The Author(s).	SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		AE	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Journal of physiology, Paris	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphysparis.2013.03.012	The main mechanisms of children's imitative exchanges with peers are highlighted here through a developmental approach taking into account the importance of  rhythmicity and synchrony. We focused on spontaneous motor imitation to describe a  playful dynamic that is paradoxical: in the experience of play in which roles are  not clearly distributed, mutual discovery of the self and others gradually arises.  From an integrative perspective, this form of interaction, produced by positional  reversal and turn taking, is apprehended through two axis. On the temporal plan, it  can be considered as a rhythmic pattern with repetition and synchrony. Moreover,  these mutual exchanges between the self and others challenge visuo-spatial abilities  in children who must be able to change their reference point through an operation of  mental rotation. Based on this description of the intersubjective experience  produced through a succession of spatial and symbolic viewpoint changes, a  developmental model of empathy is offered and discussed. According to this model,  the capacity of empathy has two dimensions, emotional and cognitive, and is  understood as a process involved in child development. In this article, we propose  that empathy is more than the "mere" capacity of decentration corresponding to the  acquisition of a theory of mind. It involves an individual in relationship with  others and who has the ability to integrate perspectives.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

Increasing evidence shows that regular Baduanjin (a traditional Chinese mind-body exercise) training is beneficial in improving physical function and cognitive ability in the older adults. The primary aim of this trial is to observe the effect of Baduanjin on physical and cognitive functions in older adults with CF. Methods and analysis In this prospective, outcome assessor-blind, two-arm randomised controlled trial, a total of 102 participants with CF will be recruited and randomly allocated (1:1) into the Baduanjin training or usual physical activity control group. The control group will receive health education for 30 min at least once a month. Based on health education, participants in the Baduanjin exercise group will receive a 24-week Baduanjin training with 60 min per session and 3 sessions per week, while those in the usual physical activity control group will maintain their original lifestyle. Primary outcomes (frailty index and global cognitive ability), body composition, grip force, balance, fatigue, specific cognitive domain, including memory, execution and visual spatial abilities, and life quality of secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline, and at 13 and 25 weeks after randomisation, while the structural and functional MRI will be measured at baseline and 25 weeks after randomisation. The mixed linear model will be conducted to observe the intervention effects. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the ethics committee of the second people's hospital of Fujian province (Approval no. 2018-KL015).

However, little is known about the predictors of individual differences in the growth trajectory of spatial ability. Children's interest in learning activities plays a significant role in their ability development in literacy, math, and science. Therefore, the current study explored the role of children's interest in spatial activities in their spatial ability development. We hypothesized that children's interest in spatial activities would positively predict both the initial level and subsequent growth rate of spatial ability. The spatial ability of 197 Hong Kong preschool children (mean age = 52.72 months and SD = 3.30 months in the first wave of spatial ability assessment [Time 1]) was assessed four times over a two-year period, using a visual–spatial skills task. Their mothers ranked the children's interest in various activities from 1 (most interested) to 13 (least interested) at Time 1. A growth curve analysis was performed to examine the relationships between interest in spatial activities at Time 1 and initial level and subsequent growth of spatial skills, controlling for parents’ expectations concerning spatial development, children's interest in art activities, and demographics. The results showed that children's interest in spatial activities significantly predicted their spatial ability growth (β = 0.252, p =. 042), explaining 5.7% of the variance in growth, but was unrelated to the initial level of spatial skills. This finding highlights the importance of preserving and enhancing young children's interest in spatial activities, among other activities, for the development of their spatial abilities. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, the current study conducted a meta-analysis of 73 studies, with 263 effect sizes to explore the relationship between spatial and mathematical ability. Furthermore, we explored potential factors that moderate this relationship. Results showed that the relationship between mathematical and spatial ability was not simply linear. Specifically, logical reasoning had a stronger association with spatial ability than numerical or arithmetic ability with spatial ability. Intrinsic-dynamic, intrinsic-static, extrinsic-dynamic, extrinsic-static spatial ability, and visual–spatial memory showed comparable associations with mathematical ability. The association between spatial and mathematical ability showed no differences between children, adolescents, and adults and no differences between typically developing individuals and individuals with developmental disabilities. The implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		2	3	0	2	2	0	0	1

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2019.04.020	How do children place numbers on a line where only the endpoints are marked? Previous researchers have shown that the differential estimation patterns on the  number line task reflect different strategies used by children. What factors  influence their transition from less efficient to more efficient strategies?  Children in Grade 1 (n = 66) and Grade 2 (n = 80) completed a 0-100 number line task  at two time points of the school year. Their ordinal skills (i.e., number ordering)  and spatial skills (i.e., mental rotation) were also measured. A latent transition  analysis revealed two types of profiles. Children showing a variable profile were  more accurate at estimating the numbers that are close to the endpoints and the  middle of the line than other numbers, and their performance did not fit any of the  linear, exponential, or logarithmic functions. In contrast, children showing a  uniform profile were accurate across all target numbers (i.e., linear performance).  Children's verbal strategy reports provided support for the latent profile  classification; children showing a uniform profile were more likely to use  relational strategies, suggesting they were considering the number line as a whole,  whereas children showing a variable profile were more likely to count from one of  the three common reference points (i.e., endpoints or the imagined midpoint).  Transition between the variable and uniform profiles was predicted by children's  ordinal skills, suggesting that children need to understand the ordinal associations  among numbers to refine their solution strategies on the number line task.

Three- to five-year-old children (N = 84) participated in 1 session of either sequential training (e.g., what comes before and after the number 5?) or non-numerical spatial training (i.e., decomposition of shapes). Children who received sequential training showed near transfer to a number ordering task and far transfer to a number line task. Furthermore, these children showed more improvement on the version of the number line task where a midpoint reference was presented (i.e., at 5) than on the version without a midpoint. Before the training, the midpoint reference did not enhance performance. In contrast, although children who received non-numerical spatial training showed near transfer to a 2-D mental transformation task, they did not show transfer to number ordering or number line tasks, even though spatial skills were correlated with performance on these tasks. These results support the view that knowledge of sequential relations among successive numbers is an important aspect of children’s early numeracy knowledge in tasks that require ordinal understanding of numbers from 1 to 10 and support the educational importance of developing numerical activities that enhance children’s understanding of these relations.

The research is based on the importance of map to preschoolers to test 4-5-year-old children (in Beijing)'s existing map experience, map-making and map-reading ability through interviewing and experiment referring to current research in China and abroad. It is aiming at studying Chinese preschoolers' mapping ability and then providing some references on map-education in preschool education. The research is divided into two parts: Test 1: 4-5-year-old children's existing map experiences. The results show that children's related experience and knowledge is in different level from different maps. The 5-year-old children performed better than 4-year-old children obviously. The main way to getting the map experience is family environment and map-related games. "Parents' education" has significant influence on children's map knowledge. However, the map experience in kindergarten is not enough to influent children to notice map. Although the teachers admit the importance of map education they think the current map-related activity is so little that individual differences of map ability is visible. Test 2: experimental study on map-making and map-reading ability. Each age group is divided into A and B d2 teams randomly. Every team has to do map-making and map-reading tasks but in opposite order. The subjects are provided to 2 maps that one is color map combining representation and geometry messages, the other is more abstract, black and white map showing geometry message only. What is more, the experiment adds rotation paradigm: 0and 180°angle. It can be assumed through the results that map-making and map-reading ability has huge development between 4 and 5 years old. However, there is no gender difference in them. Specifically, 5-year-old children have mastered map-making ability in some degree whereas 4-year-old children have not. However, each age group has progress in second map-making task significantly, especially 4 age group. It shows that map-making experience can increase children's map-making ability well. In map-reading task, 5-year-old children can do well in 0°angel using both maps. They can find the object quickly and accurately. And they can understand color map in 180°angel better then geometry map. 4-year-old children can understand color map in 0°angel only. The 3 other maps are too difficult to them. It shows that 4-year-old children rely on representation message mainly to read map otherwise 5-year-old children can combine representation and geometry message together to read map but their mental rotation ability need develop more deeply.

To investigate whether blind individuals localize sound in space better than sighted individuals, we tested the auditory ability of adolescent blind individuals using a sound lateralization method. The interaural time difference discrimination thresholds of blind individuals were statistically significantly shorter than those of blind individuals with residual vision and controls. These findings suggest that blind individuals have better auditory spatial ability than individuals with visual cues; therefore, some perceptual compensation occurred in the former. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

The present study aimed to determine whether playing a spatiallydemanding, fast-paced videogame improves mental rotation skills in a sample of older adults without prior gaming experience. Older adults (n = 17) played an action videogame ( Crazy Taxi™) at home, for a total of 60 hours. Mental rotation skills were assessed prior to training (baseline), immediately after training (post-test), and three months following post-test (follow-up). Results of the Crazy Taxi group were compared to those of a spatial-skills training group (inSight™, n = 18), and a no-contact control group (n = 19). Consistent with study hypotheses, Crazy Taxi participants evidenced more efficient mental rotation skills at follow-up. Mental rotation ability has been linked with generalized visuospatial processing speed, as well as real-world skills like wayfinding. Future work should examine whether videogame benefits to mental rotation skills translate to improvements in these real-world outcomes.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

[Subjects] The participants of this study comprised 21 university rugby players (42 legs). [Methods] The motor imagery capacity of the subjects was evaluated using mental rotation and various motor exercises. The subjects were followed up 6 months after the measurements were taken, and the hamstring strain occurring in the intermittent period was investigated. [Results] Seven legs of 6 players (7/ 42, 16.7%) showed symptoms of hamstring strain within 6 months. In addition, all these subjects had medial hamstring injury that had occurred in a non-contact fashion. A significant difference was observed in the reaction time between the strain and non-strain groups for identifying photographs of the plantar view of the foot at an orientation of -90°. Furthermore, a cutoff value of 2.48 sec for this reaction time could predict hamstring strain by discriminant analysis.

The subjects walked, with the guidance of the experimenter, on a path  which had 45, 90, or 135 degree right or left angle turn at its middle point. At the  end point of each path, the subjects walked back alone to find the starting point of  the path. The trials were repeated 12 times. The adult group made less angular error  in the direction of movement when they walked back alone, though other performance  measures scarcely showed any indications of development of the ability. The  subjects' verbal reports concerning their problem solving methods revealed that many  of them were using the starting point as an anchor while they were walking. The data  obtained were evaluated with reference to the earlier data for the sighted [Yamamoto  & Tatsuno's (1984) data]. Some points of agreement and disagreement with the  argument of put forward by Juurmaa (1973) and the present results concerning the  development of spatial ability, were also discussed.

Subjects revealed less angle  errors and less distance errors than in the previous experiment, but they did not  show any change in the percentage of "longer turns" at the third pont. The subjects'  trails of walking changed from the nonlinear to the linear types as a function of  age. Differences in the three performance measures and the developmental changes in  the walking-trails of children were discussed, the latter with reference to the  developmental transition of the spatial ability from the route to the survey types.

It was considered that the sequential comprehension was necessary for solving the reversal task, and the comprehensive understanding was necessary for solving the detour task. Half of the subjects passed the route with remarkable landmarks. Six 1 : 11 years old children were also added in this experiment. The results showed that landmarks improved subject's performance in the reversal task and had no effect on the detour task; performances in both tasks were developed. Analysis for the course walked by subjects showed negative effect of landmarks.

Method: The male mice(3-month-old) were divided into four groups, the control group, the model group, the 2 periods of EA treatment group and the 3 periods of EA treatment group, six mice in each group, the control group consisted of the wild type mice, the other three groups consisted of APP / PS1 double transgenic mice. Acupuncture at "Baihui" and "Shenshu" acupoints of the treatment groups, then apply 2Hz, 2mA for 15 minutes, once a day, 7 days a period, a day break between two periods. Morris water maze test was conducted to observe the learning, memory and spatial exploration ability. The expressions of APP, IDE and BACE1 in Parietal lobe and temporal lobe of cortex were analyzed by Western Blot, and the expression of SP in cortex was detected by immunohistochemistry. Result: Behavioral test showed that, the escape latency and the search path of the model group were significantly longer than that of the control group (P<0.05). the number of crossing platforms was significantly lower (P<0.0001). However, compared with model group, the escape latency and the search path of the treatment group were significantly shortened (P<0.05), the number of crossing platforms were significantly increased (P< 0.01). Compared with the 2 periods of electro-acupuncture treatment group, the escape latency and the search path of the 3 periods of electro- acupuncture treatment group were also significantly shortened (P<0.05), the number of crossing platforms was also significantly increased (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical results showed that there was no SP in the Parietal lobe and temporal lobe of cortex of the control group, the number of SP in the 3 periods of electro- acupuncture treatment group was significantly decreased (P<0.01) comparing with the model group. The results of Western and Blot showed that, comparing to the control group, the model group had more contents with APP, BACE1 in the Parietal lobe and temporal lobe of cortex(P<0.0001), and less IDE(P<0.0001). However, comparing to the model group, the two treatment groups had less contents with APP, BACE1(P<0.05, P<0.001), and more contents with IDE(P<0.05, PP<0.01), the 3 periods of electro-acupuncture treatment group had less contents with APP and BACE1(P<0.01)than the 2 periods of electro-acupuncture treatment group. Conclusion: Electro- acupuncture can improve the learning, memory and spatial exploration abilities of APP / PS1 double transgenic AD model mice. In addition, electro-acupuncture may regulate the content of Aβ by affecting the expression of APP, BACE1 and IDE in cortex, thereby reducing the formation and deposition of SP. © 2018, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01938	Spatial skills significantly predict educational and occupational achievements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). As early interventions for  young children are usually more effective than interventions that come later in  life, the present meta-analysis systematically included 20 spatial intervention  studies (2009-2020) with children aged 0-8 years to provide an up-to-date account of  the malleability of spatial skills in infancy and early childhood. Our results  revealed that the average effect size (Hedges's g) for training relative to control  was 0.96 (SE = 0.10) using random effects analysis. We analyzed the effects of  several moderators, including the type of study design, sex, age, outcome category  (i.e., type of spatial skills), research setting (e.g., lab vs. classroom), and type  of training. Study design, sex, and outcome category were found to moderate the  training effects. The results suggest that diverse training strategies or programs  including hands-on exploration, visual prompts, and gestural spatial training  significantly foster young children's spatial skills. Implications for research,  policy, and practice are also discussed.	ASK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	review about spatial intervention in children, maybe check sources	SK	0	1	0	0	0	0	0		2	2	1	NA	2	0	0	1

In kindergarten, visual-spatial skills, inhibition, shifting, and working memory were all uniquely associated with concurrent mathematics performance; in first grade, only working memory and visual-spatial skills were significantly related to concurrent mathematics abilities. Furthermore, working memory and visual-spatial skills in kindergarten predicted 19% of the variance in children’s mathematics performance in first grade, beyond the autoregressive effects of mathematics performance in kindergarten as well as demographic variables. Findings highlight the importance of working memory and visual-spatial skills for young Chinese children in mastering mathematics. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Children were tested first in their second year in kindergarten (K2; Time 1 [T1]) and then 12 months later in their third year (K3; Time 2 [T2]). Symbolic numerical skills were assessed using verbal counting, number recognition, number comparison, and written arithmetic tasks, while non-symbolic numerical skills were assessed using dot comparison and non-symbolic calculation tasks. Results from structural equation modeling showed that visual-spatial skills significantly predicted later non-symbolic numerical skills, while phonological short-term memory predicted later symbolic numerical skills. These associations remained even after controlling for the child's age and vocabulary. The findings highlight different constellations of cognitive skills that may be required in the development of young children's symbolic and non-symbolic numerical abilities. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.568638	Spatial language is an important predictor of spatial skills and might be inspired by peer interaction and goal-oriented building behaviors during block play. The  present study investigated the frequency, type and level of children's spatial  language during block play and their associations with the level of block play by  observing 228 young children in classrooms equipped with unit blocks and allowing  free play on a daily basis. The findings showed that during block play, young  children used more words about spatial locations, deictic terms, dimensions, and  shapes and fewer words about spatial features or properties and spatial orientations  or transformations. Spatial locations were used most frequently, and young children  tended to use vertical location words to represent the corresponding location. Most  young children used gestures in conjunction with spatial deictic terms. Among shape  words, tetragon words were frequently used, and the representation of spatial shapes  showed alternatives, collective tendencies and gender differences. The use of  spatial language during the play process had a significant positive correlation with  age, the construction structure, and form of block building.

Journal of experimental child psychology	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2021.105142	Previous literature has revealed that visual-spatial processing is associated with both reading and arithmetic. Yet the strength of their relations and the reasons why  visual-spatial processing contributes to reading and arithmetic remain ambiguous.  The current study focused on two types of visual-spatial skills that recent evidence  has suggested are crucial in children's early reading and arithmetic development:  visual-perceptual and spatial visualization skills. With an interval of 6 months, we  assessed 104 Hong Kong kindergarten children's visual-spatial skills, word reading,  arithmetic performance, and vocabulary knowledge at Wave 1; orthographic awareness,  basic number knowledge, and number line estimation at Wave 2; and Chinese word  reading and arithmetic performance at Wave 3. Correlational analysis showed that  both visual-perceptual and spatial visualization skills were associated with later  Chinese word reading and arithmetic performance. Further mediation analyses revealed  that spatial visualization skills, rather than visual-perceptual skills, contributed  to Chinese word reading via orthographic awareness and also predicted arithmetic  performance through basic number knowledge. However, number line estimation failed  to mediate any relations of visual-spatial skills with children's arithmetic  abilities. The results suggest the importance of visual-spatial processing in  Chinese word reading and mathematics, with spatial visualization contributing to  reading and mathematics for different reasons.

The British journal of educational psychology	https://doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12403	Mental rotation is positively related to arithmetic ability; however, the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. The possible roles of working memory,  place-value concept, and number line estimation in the correlation between mental  rotation and whole-number computation were investigated. One hundred and fifty-five  first-grade students were tested to determine their mental rotation ability,  arithmetic ability, and non-verbal intelligence. One year later, their working  memory, place-value concept, number line estimation, and overall arithmetic ability  were assessed. After controlling for age, gender, and prior arithmetic ability, we  found that mental rotation uniquely predicted arithmetic ability after one year.  Further mediation analyses demonstrated that number line estimation significantly  mediated the relationship between mental rotation and arithmetic ability. In  contrast, neither working memory nor place-value concept significantly mediated the  relationship between mental rotation and arithmetic ability. This study highlights  that mental number line estimation is the most important element explaining the  influence of a dynamic spatial skill, that is, mental rotation, on arithmetic  ability among young Chinese children.

Previous research shows that having well-developed spatial reasoning skills is crucial to the success in the STEM fields. Our game requires the player to create a number of 3D target objects by moving, rotating, and assembling smaller pieces in the right way through a gestural interface. The gestures were designed with enhancing the user experience and effectiveness of learning in mind, by having a congruent mapping between hand gestures and spatial operations. The initial results of the preliminary study we conducted with the children show that the interface has the potential to be used for practicing spatial reasoning skills with the game. We also discuss how the study can lead to the development of a theoretical framework for designing gestural interfaces for educational games that leverage the benefit of embodied interactions.

Developmental neuropsychology	https://doi.org/10.1080/87565641.2021.1913165	Mathematics Learning Disorder (MLD) has been found to be related to impairments in cognitive functions. Spatial ability (SA), which is made up of eight single but  unified elements can be assumed to have a leading part in different areas of math  skills. The first objective of this study was to explore differences in SA factors  in 128 school children of third to sixth grade with and without MLD. The Flexibility  of Closure, Closure Speed, Perceptual Speed, Visualization, Spatial Relation,  Spatial Orientation, Spatial Temporal, and Wayfinding were measured through eight  tasks. The second objective of the study was to explore the SA factors' ability to  predict the performance of MLD participants in three executive functions. The  results revealed that participants with MLD had poorer performance in all the SA  tasks and it took longer to finish the visualization, spatial relation, and spatial  orientation tasks compared to children with typical development (TD). Regression  analysis indicated that some of the SA factors could predict working memory and  cognitive flexibility, but they were unable to predict response inhibition.  Regarding these results, applying SA factors in cognitive rehabilitation programs of  children with MLD seems necessary.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

The neuropsychological tests included  psychomotor speed, visual-spatial ability, language, logical memory, working memory,  and executive function. The results showed that patients with delayed  neuropsychiatric syndrome (DNS) had poorer performance on neuropsychological tasks  than did those with acute CO poisoning at the 1st month and reached almost the same  level as the acute group on the neuropsychological tasks at the 6-month follow-up  assessment. The DNS group had more significant progress on general cognitive  function, psychomotor speed, and visual-spatial ability than did the acute group  after continuous hyperbaric-oxygen therapy.

Sibling correlations and within-sex score distributions were examined for the influence of a major sex-linked gene. Sex-linked influences were most clear on the test of two-dimensional visualization and on an average of the standard scores on all the tests. For those tests best fitting the genetic model, estimates of the frequency of the recessive gene (contributing to good performance) were near 0.45. There was evidence of sex limitation and a small amount of assortative mating, but no evidence of incomplete dominance in females. Environmental or non-sex-linked genetic factors influenced spatial performance but did not systematically improve performance with age. © 1975 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

Verbal skills have typically been found preserved. Findings of specific deficits have led investigators to hypothesize disruption of certain areas of the brain thought to subsume the defective functions, namely, the frontal-limbic-diencephalic system or the right hemisphere. Support for the more parsimonious model of generalized diffuse cerebral dysfunction has been weak due to lack of demonstration of verbal deficits. The repeated finding of intact verbal skills may be due to the use of relatively insensitive measures which generally assess simpler, overlearned verbal abilities, such as vocabulary knowledge.    This research investigated the effects of alcoholism on more complex verbal processes, the skills seemingly most crucial to effective treatment participation, rehabilitation, and adaptive functioning in the world. Sixty chronic alcoholics abstinent one month and 60 nonalcoholic controls matched for age, education, and vocabulary were challenged with tasks requiring higher verbal cognitive processes: analogical reasoning, problem solving, and cognitive flexibility. Despite being equivalent in verbal intelligence, the groups differed significantly in verbal problem solving and analogical reasoning, with alcoholics having relatively more difficulty with analogies of greater complexity and abstraction than controls. A subgroup of 35 alcoholics with a family history of alcoholism accounted for the deficits in higher verbal abilities. The results provide support for the generalized diffuse model of neuro-psychological dysfunction in alcoholics.    Evidence for impairment of verbal learning/memory in alcoholics is confusing due to lack of specification and experimental control of important variables. To begin to disentangle the parameters affecting this ability, difficulty of material was varied in four verbal paired-associate lists presented to the same groups of subjects. The predicted relative impairment of alcoholics with more difficult (less meaningful) material did not occur, nor did the groups' learning curves differ. Simple associative learning may not be sensitive to mild cognitive dysfunction due to alchohol despite manipulating the difficulty of material. The results emphasize the importance of subject and methodological variables in this complex area of research.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Psychological science	https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613478617	Localization of tactile stimuli to the hand and digits is fundamental to somatosensory perception. However, little is known about the development or genetic  bases of this ability in humans. We examined tactile localization in normally  developing children, adolescents, and adults and in people with Williams syndrome  (WS), a genetic disorder resulting in a wide range of severe visual-spatial  deficits. Normally developing 4-year-olds made large stimulus-localization errors,  sometimes across digits, but nevertheless their errors revealed a structured  internal representation of the hand. In normally developing individuals, errors  became exponentially smaller over age, reaching the adult level by adolescence. In  contrast, people with WS showed large localization errors regardless of age and a  significant proportion of cross-digit errors, a profile similar to that of normally  developing 4-year-olds. Thus, tactile localization reflects internal organization of  the hand even early in normal development, undergoes substantial development in  normal children, and is susceptible to developmental, but not organizational,  impairment under genetic deficit.

We examine those studies that set out to describe the nature and number of spatial and mathematical skills and specific connections between these abilities, especially those that included children as participants. We also find evidence of strong spatial-mathematical connections and transfer from spatial interventions to mathematical understanding. Finally, we map out the kinds of studies that could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which spatial and mathematical processing are connected and the principles by which mathematical outcomes could be enhanced through spatial training in educational settings.

Performances on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), McCarthy Scales, Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT), and Das' simultaneous-successive marker tests for 29 LD and 29 Normal children (aged six to eight years) were compared.    Data indicated that Normals scored significantly higher on all tests administered. However, the difference between Full Scale IQ and McCarthy General Cognitive Index (GCI) was eight points. LD's performed significantly lower on ACID profile (Arithmetic, Coding, Information, and Digit Span), and Bannatyne's Conceptual, Sequential, and Acquired Knowledge groupings. Correlational analyses indicated that for Normals, Concepts of Spatial, right brain tests, and simultaneous processing appeared highly related. LD's appeared to have less definitive spatial ability, and use successive processing, left brain, and sequential processing in most if not all learning tasks. On the McCarthy Scales, no support was found for Reynold's left brain groupings. Achievement was unrelated to either simultaneous nor successive processing, a fact which is consistent with Das' factor analytic studies.    Support was found for Kaufman's suggestion to employ neuropsychological theories (Das's model) to investigate exceptional children's performance patterns. As suggested by Kaufman, this study supported previous hypotheses that different concepts (e.g., Bannatyne's groupings) may have differing meanings for different groups of children.

In one group, children handle the experimental device ; in the other group, the device was handled by the experimenter. The results suggest that action supports mental imagery processes at least until the age of 9-10 years. Mental imagery becomes independent from the concrete world about 9-10 years old, when a dynamic and flexible spatial thought is available to children.

Instrumentations: attention measured by the MOXO-CPT, a computerized test, and The Cognitive Modifiability Battery Reproduction of Patterns measured spatial abilities. Measurements were conducted pre- and post-interventions. Results showed fast improvement from pre- to post-intervention, achieved simultaneously in both EFs for the experimental groups only. No differences were found between boys and girls.

Children are attracted to communication by its musical features. This is made evident by studies indicating that children prefer infant-directed songs to infant-directed speech, and that infants move to music more than to speech. Music-making appears to have multiple benefits for young children’s social health and well-being. Music-making, and often specifically music training, has been linked to improvement of cognitive skills in children, but the route through which this takes place is under investigation. Music training has also been related to improvement in spatial abilities, literacy and numeracy skills. Music environments must provide a safe and supportive environment, which can enable children to experiment, engage in risk-taking and move beyond their levels of ability. The adult needs to be well-attuned to the child’s musical play, otherwise the adult’s responses could cause the play to stop or cause frustration to the children. © 2020 Sue Robson.

Conf. Proc. Ser.	https://doi.org/10.1145/3453892.3453893	This article proposes a novel approach for augmenting generative adversarial network (GAN) with a self-supervised task in order to improve its ability for encoding video representations that are useful in downstream tasks such as human activity recognition. In the proposed method, input video frames are randomly transformed by different spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation and shearing or temporal transformations such as shuffling temporal order of frames. Then discriminator is encouraged to predict the applied transformation by introducing an auxiliary loss. Subsequently, results prove superiority of the proposed method over baseline methods for providing a useful representation of videos used in human activity recognition performed on datasets such as KTH, UCF101 and Ball-Drop. Ball-Drop dataset is a specifically designed dataset for measuring executive functions in children through physically and cognitively demanding tasks. Using features from proposed method instead of baseline methods caused the top-1 classification accuracy to increase by more then 4%.

Toddlers’ understanding of shapes	Infant Behavior and Development	https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infbeh.2016.12.002	Using the intermodal preferential looking paradigm, two-year-old children's ability to discriminate valid (typical and atypical) squares, rectangles, triangles, and circles from invalid distractors was examined. The cognitive and environmental factors that might predict this ability were also investigated. Two-year-old children (N = 33) were able to discriminate squares, triangles, and circles, but not rectangles. No significant cognitive or environmental predictors of this ability were found. The results suggest that the ability to shape discriminate at age two is under considerable development and that other factors may be responsible for children's ability to discriminate shapes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Pragmatic advantages are seen in high mobility during computer-based learning due to a high portability of mobile devices and an easy online access to learning applications at places in and outside classrooms. From a psychological perspective, it is of special interest to examine how different modes of interaction with learning materials (e.g. through apps on tablets) affect performance and motivation. For example, touch screens can afford rather natural gestures and embodied interaction. For various contexts, the use of gestures to interact with information presentations (e.g. with 2-D and 3-D visualizations) has been shown to be beneficial for solving spatial tasks. It is of interest whether use of gestures can also improve learning from dynamic visual information presented on touch-based devices. We present and discuss a study in which we focused on the question of whether, for elementary school students, solving spatial tasks can be enhanced by using touch-gestures on mobile devices. Two conditions of spatial rotation tasks were compared using a within-and between subject design: an interactive, touch-based app allowing to physically rotate objects and a paper-based, static version. Elementary school students worked with both conditions, though in different orders. Findings suggest that the app-based, dynamic version improves task solving significantly with regard to success rate, mental and temporal efficiency. However, results clearly show that effects mostly exist only after children had first completed the paper-based, static trial of tasks in which they needed to mentally rotate the objects. The results indicate an additive, enhancing effect of the touch-based, dynamic interaction mode especially for children who already are capable of solving the tasks by using mental rotation processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Towards an understanding of the zone of proximal development (ZPD) dynamics from a piagetian perspective: Gender composition and its changing role from early to middle childhood	Psihologija	https://doi.org/10.2298/PSI181023006Z	The present study revisits the complexities of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) through an experimental investigation of the role of social identity dynamics in asymmetric social interaction around a cognitive Piagetian task in two age groups. Children from two age groups (6 and 10 years old) first solved a spatial transformation task individually (pretest) and then worked in same-or mixed-gender pairs with a partner who was more advanced in task knowledge. In the posttest phase, participants again solved the task individually. At posttest, the six-years old participating in interaction, performed better than those in control groups, who did not engage in interaction. However, there were no differences in the posttest performance of the ten-years old who participated in interaction and those who did not. Moreover, the effect of gender composition on the dynamics of the interaction was different in the two age groups. The social gender identity dynamics formed in the interactions of the six-year olds related to cognitive progress outcomes, but at 10 years social construction of knowledge was equally successful in promoting cognitive development compared to asymmetric social interactions and gender identity dynamics did not have the same formative influence. © 2019 by authors.

The research was carried through an innovative pre-test, first interaction, second interaction, post-test design. One hundred fifty-nine children of the same age (6.5-7.5 years old) but of different levels of knowledge of a spatial-transformation task collaborated in same-sex and opposite-sex dyads to find a joint solution. In the first interaction, a child less developmentally advanced (NC) had to work with a child more developmentally advanced (TC), whereas in the second interaction of the same gender composition, the same NC had to work with a fresh NC. Cognitive progress was assessed using pre-test to post-test gains. The results revealed that the gender composition of the pairs and knowledge asymmetry influence not only the behavioral patterns and strategies that each partner employs in the interaction but also the cognitive outcomes of the children. These findings shed more light to the process through which socio-cognitive conflict gets resolved, which was considered until now a "black box". © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although it is commonly thought that such differences emerge during adolescence, this theory has been disputed. Two samples (normal children, average ages 13.7 and 13.4 years for males and females, respectively) were administered a complex spatial task. Performance was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Boys solved more problems, but even when they made errors, their answers were qualitatively more “abstract” that is, they showed a better and more effective visuospatial reasoning ability. These findings are discussed in light of sex-differential cognitive styles also related to psychophysiological and environmental factors. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	https://doi.org/10.1080/09297049.2020.1862075	Several studies investigated the neuropsychological bases of spatial construction in developmental samples. However, no study directly tested whether the pattern of the  neuropsychological processes implied in spatial construction changed depending on  whether a block building or a figure drawing task is considered. Here, we used the  path analysis to test the direct and indirect effects of verbal abilities (naming  and verbal knowledge), executive functions, figure disembedding and mental rotation  on two classical spatial construction tasks: the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure  (ROCF) and the Block Design (BD). We recruited a sample of 186 typically developing  children (age range: 7-12 years). Results showed that ROCF copying was directly  influenced by age and figure disembedding, and it was indirectly affected by  executive functions, naming and verbal knowledge, whereas BD was influenced in a  direct way by verbal knowledge, figure disembedding and mental rotation and  indirectly affected by executive functions and naming skills. Moreover, the results  showed a full measurement invariance of the path model between sexes, whereas only  partial invariance was found for age. Thus, we tested the model in two age groups  (age ranges: 7-9.5 and 9.6-12 years) and found that the relationships between the  variables of the model changed across development. Although other variables might be  relevant to spatial construction, the present findings demonstrate different  neuropsychological bases of drawing figures and building blocks in typically  developing children.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02477	Until now, there has been no integrated study of the cognitive, motor and academic developments in children in the Arab world. In this study we investigated gender  differences in those three areas in primary school-aged children in Oman and as well  as the inter-relations between those three aspects of development. Ninety-five third  graders completed four working memory tests, a mental rotation test and a motor  test. Furthermore, the marks in math, science and Arabic language were registered.  The result showed that there were small gender differences: Girls performed better  in one of the working memory tests and boys in the coordination motor test. The  study also showed that there were significant correlations between cognitive  variables and academic performance, as well as two significant correlations between  motor performance and marks in math and science. Marks in math correlated with the  performances in the 20 m run and the coordination test, whereas the marks in science  correlated with the ball-leg-wall test, the coordination test, and the endurance  test. Regression analysis showed that all marks were predicted by the working memory  and mental rotation performance as well as the motor ability. This means that  academic achievement in Oman could be predicted by basic cognitive as well as motor  abilities.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Frontiers in human neuroscience	https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.698367	Spatial cognitive abilities, including mental rotation (MR) and visuo-spatial working memory (vsWM) are correlated with mathematical performance, and several  studies have shown that training of these abilities can enhance mathematical  performance. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of MR and  vsWM training combined with number line (NL) training. Fifty-seven children, aged  6-7, performed 25 days of NL training combined with either vsWM or MR and  participated in an Electroencephalography (EEG)-session in school to measure resting  state activity and steady-state visual evoked potentials during a vsWM task before  and after training. Fifty children, aged 6-7, received usual teaching and acted as a  control group. Compared to the control group, both training groups improved on a  combined measure of mathematics. Cognitive improvement was specific to the training.  Significant pre-post changes in resting state-EEG (rs-EEG), common to both training  groups, were found for power as well as for coherence, with no significant  differences in rs-EEG-changes between the vsWM and MR groups. Two of the common  rs-EEG changes were correlated with mathematical improvement: (1) an increase in  coherence between the central frontal lobe and the right parietal lobe in  frequencies ranging from 16 to 25 Hz, and (2) an increase in coherence between the  left frontal lobe and the right parietal lobe ranging from 23 to 25 Hz. These  results indicate that changes in fronto-parietal coherence are related to an  increase in mathematical performance, which thus might be a useful measure in  further investigations of mathematical interventions in children.

However, textbook research on spatial ability has so far received little attention. In this study, we investigated whether school mathematics textbooks provide enough opportunities for primary students to learn three dimensional shapes and help them acquire spatial ability. Three mathematics textbook series used in Hong Kong were analysed through content analysis. Findings showed each series of textbooks contained five domains for introducing solid figures, which included real-life examples, understanding concepts, measurement, finding laws, and developing spatial ability. The development of spatial abilities was mainly shown in the production of three-dimensional graphics. What students experienced in the learning of 3-D shapes was relatively narrow. Geometric graphics were mainly limited to the conventional shapes at the early stage. Activities to explore three-dimensional graphics were insufficient. It was suggested that combining the surrounding world of children with geometry in the classroom was not just a criterion for textbooks but also the focus of classroom teaching. The flexibility of teachers' adoptions of textbooks is also worthy of further investigation. © 2021 the authors; licensee Modestum. All Rights Reserved.

Conf. Innov. Des. Digit. Technol., ICIDDT	https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIDDT52279.2020.00048	Mental rotation refers to a mental operation process of making planar or stereoscopic rotation of the mirror image of a person himself, or a visual stimulus (like a graph) in his/her brain. An augmented reality (AR)-based virtual model was established to control the children's cognitive characteristics, etc., and realize the mental rotation ability training among the target children. The mental rotation experimental materials of Peter1995 version were used and divided into abstract images, and concrete models, two progressive experiments were carried out, followed by the type-in and statistical analysis of the data via SPSS22.0. In the end, the results were evaluated using the SUS system scale, and whether the AR technology-based teaching could improve the children's abstract thinking abilities in generalizing and classifying the objects from different dimensions was judged. The research results show that the AR technology can support the formation of children's concrete and abstract thinking, and provide the effective mental rotation ability training for the preschool children 3-6 years old. © 2020 IEEE.

The results showed that vocabulary, letter knowledge, spatial perception, and executive skills all made a unique contribution to number competence. The findings add to the literature by documenting the critical importance of spatial perception and written language for early number learning.

This cross-sectional study examined how fundamental domain-general capacities, including language, spatial, and self-regulatory skills, together relate to competencies in reading, mathematics, and science in young Chinese children. A total of 584 Chinese children aged approximately six years were tested individually on their language (receptive vocabulary), spatial (spatial perception, spatial visualization, and mental rotation), and self-regulation (behavioral regulation and working memory) skills, as well as their academic competencies in reading, mathematics, and science. The results showed that vocabulary, spatial, and self-regulatory skills were all associated with Chinese reading, mathematics, and life sciences, whereas only vocabulary was related to earth and physical sciences. The relation between vocabulary and formal mathematics and that between mental rotation and life sciences were found to be stronger in boys than in girls. The findings suggest that foundational domain-general skills may provide the building blocks for children's academic competencies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The present study aims to examine the similarities and differences in the cognitive precursors of word reading and arithmetic competencies in young Chinese children. A total of 75 Hong Kong Chinese children were tested first in the fall (T1) and then in the spring (T2) of their third kindergarten years. Competencies in Chinese word reading, including both single- and double-character word reading, and arithmetic calculation, including nonsymbolic arithmetic, arithmetic word problems, and written arithmetic, were assessed at both T1 and T2. Phonological awareness, orthographic awareness, rapid automatized naming (RAN), spatial perception, and spatial visualization were assessed at T1. The results showed that phonological awareness predicted later competencies in word reading and symbolic arithmetic, specifically arithmetic word problems and written arithmetic. RAN was predictive of later competencies in word reading and nonsymbolic arithmetic. Orthographic awareness was associated with later competencies in word reading but not arithmetic. Visual-spatial skills predicted later competencies in arithmetic word problems but not word reading. The findings suggest that similarities and differences both exist in the cognitive underpinnings of Chinese word reading and arithmetic competencies at a young age. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This effect was over and above the overall levels of spatial perception and spatial reasoning and the level and rate of growth in phonological awareness.

Child development	https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12173	Utilizing a longitudinal sample of Finnish children (ages 6-10), two studies examined how early linguistic (spoken vs. written) and spatial skills predict later  development of arithmetic, and whether counting sequence knowledge mediates these  associations. In Study 1 (N = 1,880), letter knowledge and spatial visualization,  measured in kindergarten, predicted the level of arithmetic in first grade, and  later growth through third grade. Study 2 (n = 378) further showed that these  associations were mediated by counting sequence knowledge measured in first grade.  These studies add to the literature by demonstrating the importance of written  language for arithmetic development. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis  that linguistic and spatial skills can improve arithmetic development by enhancing  children's number-related knowledge.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.563493	Block building is a popular play activity among young children and is also used by psychologists to assess their intelligence. However, little research has attempted  to systematically explore the cognitive bases of block-building ability. The current  study (N = 66 Chinese preschoolers, 32 boys and 34 girls; mean age = 4.7 years, SD =  0.29, range = 3.4 to 5.2 years) investigated the relationships between six measures  of spatial skills (shape naming, shape recognition, shape composition, solid figure  naming, cube transformation, and mental rotation, with the former four representing  form perception and the latter two representing visualization) and block-building  complexity. Correlation results showed that three of the four measures of form  perception (shape naming, shape recognition, and shape composition) were  significantly and positively correlated with block-building complexity, whereas the  two measures of visualization were not. Results from regression models indicated  that shape recognition and shape composition, as well as shape-recognition-by-gender  interaction, were unique predictors of children's block-building complexity. These  findings provide preliminary evidence for the basic spatial skills underlying  children's block-building complexity and have implications for classroom  instructions aimed at improving preschoolers' block-building complexity.

Hierarchical regressions showed that both non-symbolic numerical processing (numerosity comparison) and symbolic numerical processing (digit comparison) were independent predictors of arithmetical computation but neither was a predictor of mathematical reasoning (assessed by number series completion).

This study was conducted to test whether visuospatial tasks (typically based on visual form perception) may account for the association. A total of 271 children around 10 years of age were recruited from three primary schools in Beijing, China. The children were administered eight tasks to assess their visuospatial processing and arithmetic fluency, as well as their processing speed and nonverbal intelligence as cognitive covariates. Visual form perception scores were measured by a figure matching task and a visual short-term memory task and fully accounted for the correlation between ANS acuity and arithmetic fluency. Spatial processing scores as measured by a spatial short-term memory task and a mental rotation task were not significant in the correlation. The results suggest that visual form perception is the cognitive mechanism explaining the association between ANS acuity and arithmetic fluency. Only visuospatial processes that rely on visual form perception promote ANS and arithmetic fluency. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		3	3	1	NA	3	0	0	1

Phase I of the study was undertaken to establish the reliability and validity of the Test of Relational Reasoning-Junior (TORRjr), a 32-item measure developed to assess children’s and young adolescents’ ability to reason analogically, anomalously, antinomously, and antithetically. The range of analyses from item difficulties to the overall structural model showed the TORRjr to be a psychometrically sound measure for study participants. There was also evidence of development in students’ relational reasoning ability. In Phase II, the contributions of TORRjr performance to results of a novel measure of quantitative relations (QRTC²), a traditional measure of mathematical ability (MAT), and a fluid measure of mental rotation (MRT) were examined. Relational reasoning was significantly associated with performance on all 3 measures to a moderate or moderately strong level. Relational reasoning was also found to partially mediate the association between the QRTC² and MAT and fully mediate the relation between MRT and MAT. Multiple-group regression analyses revealed a stronger association between relational reasoning and mathematical performance for middle-school students than for primary students. Theoretical and practical implications of the outcomes from both phases are forwarded.

Cognitive processing	https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-020-00980-w	Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between approximate number system (ANS) acuity and mathematical performance. Studies have also shown that ANS acuity  can predict the longitudinal development of mathematical achievement. Visual form  perception in the current investigation was proposed to account for the predictive  role of ANS acuity in the development of mathematical achievement. One hundred and  eighty-eight school children (100 males, 88 females; mean age = 12.2 ± 0.3 years)  participated in the study by completing five tests: numerosity comparison, figure  matching, mental rotation, nonverbal matrix reasoning, and choice reaction time.  Three years later, they took a mathematical achievement test. We assessed whether  the early tests predicted mathematical achievement at the later date. Analysis  showed that the ANS acuity measured via numerosity comparison significantly  predicted mathematical achievement 3 years later, even when controlling for  individual differences in mental rotation, nonverbal matrix reasoning, and choice  reaction time, as well as age and gender differences. Hierarchical regression and  mediation analyses further showed that the longitudinal predictive role of ANS  acuity in mathematical achievement was interpreted by visual form perception  measured with a figure-matching test. Together, these results indicate that visual  form perception may be the underlying cognitive mechanism that links ANS acuity to  mathematical achievement in terms of longitudinal development.

Frontiers in psychology	https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01364	Studies have shown that numerosity processing (e.g., comparison of numbers of dots in two dot arrays) is significantly correlated with arithmetic performance.  Researchers have attributed this association to the fact that both tasks share  magnitude processing. The current investigation tested an alternative hypothesis,  which states that visual perceptual ability (as measured by a figure-matching task)  can account for the close relation between numerosity processing and arithmetic  performance (computational fluency). Four hundred and twenty four third- to  fifth-grade children (220 boys and 204 girls, 8.0-11.0 years old; 120 third graders,  146 fourth graders, and 158 fifth graders) were recruited from two schools (one  urban and one suburban) in Beijing, China. Six classes were randomly selected from  each school, and all students in each selected class participated in the study. All  children were given a series of cognitive and mathematical tests, including  numerosity comparison, figure matching, forward verbal working memory, visual  tracing, non-verbal matrices reasoning, mental rotation, choice reaction time,  arithmetic tests and curriculum-based mathematical achievement test. Results showed  that figure-matching ability had higher correlations with numerosity processing and  computational fluency than did other cognitive factors (e.g., forward verbal working  memory, visual tracing, non-verbal matrix reasoning, mental rotation, and choice  reaction time). More important, hierarchical multiple regression showed that figure  matching ability accounted for the well-established association between numerosity  processing and computational fluency. In support of the visual perception  hypothesis, the results suggest that visual perceptual ability, rather than  magnitude processing, may be the shared component of numerosity processing and  arithmetic performance.

Conf. Comput. Educ.: Think Glob. Act Local - Workshop Proc.	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018976401&partnerID=40&md5=c6a08239825b7ceab13bdf8817da2c39	Having good spatial cognition strongly predicts children's later achievement in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) skills. How to improve children's spatial cognition properly and what type of games might enhance spatial ability were discussed in previous studies. Video games were proved significantly more effective than other games in improving spatial performance. Additionally, previous studies indicate that augmented reality (AR) technology present unique features to stimulate children's optimal spatial learning. This paper presents preliminary work illustrating the utilization of an AR game: "Build our Town" that combines a virtual world with a real board game for the purpose of enhancing young children's spatial cognition.

The current study examined the relation between 66 preschool children’s patterning skills and their general cognitive abilities, including fluid reasoning, working memory, and spatial skill. Further, the link between patterning and general math knowledge and specific math skills (i.e., numeracy and shape knowledge) was examined. Children’s patterning skills were significantly but only moderately linked to their performance on general cognitive ability measures (e.g., fluid reasoning). Further, beyond the effects of these general cognitive abilities, patterning significantly predicted both general math and numeracy knowledge, as well as verbal calculation and magnitude comparison. Thus, although patterning skills related to measures of general cognitive ability, patterning was a unique contributor to children’s general math and numeracy knowledge and specific math skills. Theories of math development and early math standards should thus be modified to emphasize the role of children’s patterning skills to their math development. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

Parents of preschoolers (n = 63) were surveyed about their support of three components of early mathematics knowledge (i.e., numeracy, spatial, and pattern) as well as parents’ math-related beliefs about themselves and their children. Children were administered a broad math knowledge assessment which included a numeracy subscale, and individual measures of spatial and patterning skills in the fall (concurrently). Broad math knowledge was measured again in the spring of the preschool year. Parents indicated providing some support of early math development through numeracy, spatial, and patterning activities, with a stronger emphasis on numeracy than pattern and space. Parents’ child-specific ability beliefs were related to their numeracy, pattern, and broad math support, while their parent-specific ability beliefs were related to their spatial support. Parent support was rarely linked to child skills, except that numeracy support related to concurrent numeracy knowledge. Findings suggest that although parents do support a broad range of early math skills at home, parents tend to prioritize supporting early numeracy. Parents’ beliefs, especially about their child's academic abilities, may influence components of the early home math environment, but future research is needed to better understand the relations between parent's academic beliefs and the home math environment they create. © 2018	ASK	0	0	1	0	0	0	0		SK	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	can't access to see the age of the preschoolers	3	5	0	3	3	0	0	1

The purpose of the current study was to examine the causal effects of repeating patterning and numeracy tutoring on repeating patterning, numeracy, and general mathematics knowledge in the year before kindergarten (i.e., pre-K). Children in pre-K (N = 211) were randomly assigned to receive five sessions of researcher-delivered tutoring (a) on repeating patterns and numeracy or (b) on numeracy (and literacy as an active control), or received no tutoring and business as usual classroom instruction (control). Children who received tutoring in repeating patterning and numeracy improved in their repeating patterning knowledge the most. However, children’s general math and numeracy knowledge improved similarly across conditions, and a specific aspect of numeracy emphasized during the tutoring did not improve. Children’s repeating patterning knowledge is malleable, but this initial attempt to demonstrate causal links between repeating patterning and math knowledge was not successful. Results parallel mixed success in research training other skills, such as working memory or spatial skills, for improving mathematics knowledge. Findings are discussed in terms of the relations between patterning, numeracy, and general math knowledge in preschoolers.

Here, we compared the quantity and quality of the language children hear during play with either a traditional (nonelectronic) or an electronic shape sorter designed to teach children about geometric shapes. Spatial toys and spatial language, in particular, were explored since recent work has established that parents' use of spatial language links to children's short- and long-term performance on spatial tasks (Pruden, Levine, & Huttenlocher, 2011), and that spatial skills are relevant to success in learning mathematics and science (Newcombe, 2010). Traditional toys prompted more parental spatial language and more varied overall language than did electronic toys. © 2015 International Mind, Brain, and Education Society and Blackwell Publishing, Inc.
